<div>
  <h2 id='ch01' class='c011'>CHAPTER I <br /> <br />READY FOR THE TAKE-OFF</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>It was a day in the late Fall when Jack
Ralston, accompanied by his best pal, Gabe
Perkiser, known simply as “Perk” by all his
friends, found themselves climbing out of a
hired taxi that had halted on the border of
Candler Flying Field just a short distance out
of Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! reg’lar mob out here today, seems
like,” observed Perk, as he took note of the
triple line of cars parked around the field, with
its numerous up-to-date hangars, and with ships
coming and going every few minutes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, you see Perk, it happens to be a big day
at stunt flying, with fat prizes for the winners.
All the better for us, I’d say, since our take-off
will hardly make a ripple in the pond, with all
this confusion going on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing, my boy,” continued Perk, with
one of his humorous grins that betokened a good-natured
chap; “and privacy’s just what we crave.
I guess now that might be the mail comin’ from
down East an’ New York?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A rotten guess then, Perk,” chortled the
other; “Eastern mail boat was due here at six-ten
this morning; the Pitcairn Aviation concern
handle that route, as well as the run between
Atlanta and Miami down in Florida; and I’m
telling you for a fact the boys holding the stick
with <i>that</i> corporation are nearly always on time
to the dot, come storm, come fog as thick as
pea-soup. The schedule I glimpsed at the Atlanta
post office gave the time of the East Coast
ship as seven-thirty P. M.; that from New Orleans
at six-thirty P. M.; and the one from
Chicago about the same time. So you see it
couldn’t be a mail crate dropping down right
now, unless they’d had to make a forced landing,
and lost time in making repairs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, come to think of it I sure did hear a
bus passin’ over just at peep o’ day,” admitted
Perk. “Let’s have a look-in while we’re here,
and see what a bag o’ tricks these stunt flyers
are holdin’ up their sleeves, so’s to give this
crowd a row o’ thrills.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suits me, Perk; no great hurry about our
jumping off, so long as we pull the gun before
dark sets in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! little difference it makes on a patch
as well lighted as this Candler Field o’ your
home city, old boy; and with a flashlight beacon
set every ten miles all the way down to Orleans,
to keep us on our course. Look at that guy
fairly burning the air like hot cakes—he must
be tryin’ to beat the speed record, I guess, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hardly a day comes without some record
going by the board,” remarked Jack, who had
a reputation as a safe and sane pilot, although
on occasion he had been known to put through
some tricks so death-defying as to make the
hearts of the spectators seem to jump up in
their throats with the thrill.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was quite correct when he stated that
Atlanta was the home city of his close friend
and chum; although Jack’s family had moved
away years back, and become fruit raisers in
far-off California. Still, having spent some
years in the Georgia capital Jack always liked
to drop in and renew a limited number of old
friendships when opportunity offered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack Ralston had begun his aviation work
starting at the lowest round, that of a Gypsy
pilot, flying an ancient boat at County Fairs and
Harvest Home gatherings; doing aerial stunts,
and “bailing out” by means of a parachute while
another pilot ran the ship; also taking up air
minded “sand-bags” as passengers at so much
each person.</p>

<p class='c013'>From this modest beginning he had finally
accepted a position with an aircraft corporation
having contracts with the Post Office Department
at Washington for carrying the mails, and
later on express matter as well; and last of all
working for Uncle Sam through joining the
Secret Service corps of skillful detectives, whose
activities covered every part of the Nation, and
even to adjacent countries as well.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the Government wearied of the bold
doings of one “Slippery Slim” Garrabrant, and
decided to “clip the wings” of that audacious
freebooter and bogus-money crook, it was only
natural they should pick Jack for this service.
The reasons for doing so were many, but what
counted most was Jack’s well known cleverness
as an all-round air pilot; for it happened that
the slick rogue who had been giving the revenue
men such a wild-goose chase, with his thumb
held up to his nose, so to speak, was himself a
remarkable master of the air lanes, he having
been an ace as a flying pilot over with the army
on the Argonne front in France.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since as a rule this troublesome offender carried
on his bold enterprises by means of a handy
plane—frequently with a single assistant, who
helped handle both ship and cargo—the man
thus selected to put a crimp in his activities was
likewise given full permission to engage a helper
from the same arm of the Government forces,
one who must of course know something about
the handling of a plane, so that in case of necessity
he could serve as co-pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack lost no time in picking Gabe Perkiser,
otherwise known simply as “Perk”—a man who
had supped with adventure since he was “knee
high to a duck”—a half Yankee—half Canuck,
drifting into the army, and serving with the
sausage observation balloon corps over in
France; from which patriotic occupation he
later on became a champion light-weight boxer.
Leaving the ring while as yet undefeated he
served for several years with the Canadian
Mounted Police. Here his smartness in usually
fetching back his man, no matter what the difficulties
that had to be surmounted, attracted
the attention of a gentleman connected with
Uncle Sam’s Secret Service, just then moose
hunting over the northern border, who finally
influenced Perk to join up with his force.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and the other had met under peculiar
conditions when both were tracking a bunch of
check raisers floating across the country and
leaving a wide swath of victims in their path.
They had become more than friends, although
meeting but seldom; then, when the opportunity
came for Jack to call upon Perk to join him in
the new job that had been turned over to his
charge, the latter had responded with alacrity.</p>

<p class='c013'>So here they were, on the threshold of an
affair that promised to engage their united talents
in running down the leader of the most
troublesome gang of counterfeit currency makers
known to the Government agents in the last
ten years.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every clue possessed at Headquarters had
been turned over to Jack at the time he was
given authority to carry on as the situation demanded;
although this information was a bit
limited, and much was left to the shrewdness
of the two trail hounds themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no hurry at all, and Jack had
always been one of those cautious workers who
meant to provide for all sorts of emergencies.
Only too well did he know how many a splendid
undertaking went on the rocks from lack of
foreseeing the next move on the part of the
astute criminals whose apprehension meant so
much to the Government, as well as the folks
they were victimizing.</p>

<p class='c013'>But by now he had decided everything was
arranged so far as human means would permit,
and that it was high time they started on their
long chase. Their boat, a Stinson Detroiter, a
monoplane with a Wright Whirlwind motor,
and reckoned to be an unusually swift craft, was
already loaded, and ready for immediate departure.
It had been stored in one of the big
hangars connected with the Candler Flying
Field but could be taxied into position when
Jack felt ready to skip off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their flying togs were also contained in a
locker in the same hangar, and could be donned
in a jiffy, even to the ’chute harness that was
so familiar to Jack, and a constant reminder of
early experiences when he was accustomed to
carry out his daily program of “quitting the
ship” with as much <i>sang froid</i> as though the
jump into space from a five thousand foot ceiling
were absolutely next to nothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>But plainly Perk was becoming a bit restless,
as though eager to be on his way; which fact
doubtless influenced Jack to eventually give the
word that took them to their hangar. Here
they commenced preparing for a night flight
that was expected to land them in New Orleans,
where Jack was to interview a certain representative
of the Government service, from whom
he anticipated receiving a few valuable tips that
would give them something tangible and serve
as a beginning of their arduous chase.</p>

<p class='c013'>While they were thus engaged someone
hailed them with a boisterous greeting, at which
Perk grinned, and made a suitable reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hey, Scotty, this your night off, is it—got
in from your route okay, and stepped out to see
the boys cut a few figger-eights in the sky—just
can’t keep away from the game, even when you
got a lay-off? What’s new, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They told me at the house you expected to
step off tonight, boys—is that a fact, or did they
slip an easy one over me, I want to know?” demanded
the other, who was apparently a mail
pilot friend of theirs—in fact, having the adjoining
room at the small hotel where they were
stopping.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” Jack told him, secretive as usual,
“we’re going further, and boosting the Stinson
Detroiter ship by showing what it has to set it
above most other boats. Plans not fully arranged
as yet, but we’re on our way; so it’s good-bye,
and good luck to you, Scotty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about that news, Scotty?” the insistent
Perk went on to demand, being by nature one of
those stubborn chaps who can never be happy
until they get what they are after, no matter
how trivial it may seem.</p>

<p class='c013'>The air mail pilot scratched his head, and
then with a grin answered Perk’s question.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much along the line of aviation;
but something queer happened to me—say, did
you boys sleep at home last night while I was
on the road?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We sure did,” Perk told him, and then
added: “What makes you ask that, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Didn’t hear any sort of racket in my den
did you, fellows?” continued the other; at which
Perk, after exchanging a look of bewilderment
with his pal, hastened to answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a thing, Scotty; but then you know I
sleep like a log; and it’d have to be a thunderclap
to wake me up; what’s been going on?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You got me guessing, Perk,” said the other,
with a look of disgust; “only when I got in this
morning I found my room looking like a hurricane
had struck it, my things tossed out of drawers,
my trunk broken open, and say, you never
saw such a dirty mess. Course I asked the boss
what it meant; but he was as much surprised
as I was—talked with every servant from the
cook down to Mary the chamber maid; but
nobody could tell a darned thing about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again Jack and Perk exchanged a swift
glance, as though the same idea had struck both
of them. Scotty did not appear to notice this,
being too worked up with the mystery that had
so suddenly gripped his fortunes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did you lose anything worth while, Scotty?”
Jack asked, in a voice that suggested sympathy;
but to his surprise the other shook his head in
the negative, and even grinned as he lifted his
heavy eyebrows to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s the funny part of it, boys; whoever
the sneak thief was, he didn’t even dent me a
little bit—so far as I c’n see not a blessed thing
is missing—fact is, I’m even better off than before
he paid that queer visit, ’cause he left this
old pocketbook mixed up with my traps; and
it ain’t mine for a fact, though I’m meaning to
spend the little wad of dough it holds. Like
manna coming down to the children of Israel
in the Wilderness, wouldn’t you say, boys?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lucky old hoss you are, Scotty,” remarked
Perk, enviously; while Jack nodded his head as
though to echo the sentiment.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c014'>CHAPTER II <br /> <br />THE LUCK OF SCOTTY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Happen to have that pocketbook along with
you, Scotty?” asked Jack, in a matter of fact
tone; just as though he might be possessed of
ordinary curiosity concerning so amazing a
visit; since never before had he heard of a night
prowler leaving his own money behind him,
when his intention had been to rob his victim.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing, Jack,” promptly replied the air
mail pilot; “here, take a squint at my Christmas
present, dropped in by old Santa Claus
a bit before the reg’lar holiday season,” and with
a laugh he chucked the object in question into
the hand of the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Old, just as you remarked, Scotty,” observed
Jack, “and used a long time. It must have
slipped out of his pocket when he worked your
stuff over to mix it up like the devil.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Open it up and see what the blessed chump
left me in place of his card,” the other continued,
looking exceedingly proud over his lucky
find.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did that with alacrity; in fact it
was what he intended doing, for reasons of his
own; something more than curiosity influencing
him, it would appear.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gee whiz! a neat little bunch of the needful,
I’d say, Scotty, old hoss!” burst out the envious
Perk, his eyes fixed full upon the contents of
the much worn pocketbook, which Jack was
holding in his hand and apparently interested
in counting, for there were a number of bank
notes for various amounts, and among them just
three five-dollar bills, seemingly quite fresh,
though a bit soiled, as though they had been in
circulation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nineteen smackers in all,” announced Perk,
showing that he had also been keeping tabs on
the count. “Well, wouldn’t that knock you cold
though? Huh? that same caller must’ve been
looking for <i>me</i>, and just missed connections by
striking the next door. Well, here’s wishing you
the same old luck every time a sneak thief pays
you a visit, Scotty boy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack on his part was feeling of the three five-dollar
bills, and holding them up to the light
from the western sun that managed to come
into the hangar by way of the open doors.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What ails you, Jack?” demanded the recipient
of Fortune’s smiles, as he noticed these
strange actions on the part of his new friend.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much,” he was told, “only I’m going
to give you a bit of advice, partner, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to it, boy; always willing to take it
when it seems sound!” snapped the mail carrier,
briskly enough, still more than curious.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you’re wise, Scotty,” went on Jack, smilingly,
“you’ll not try to pass any one of these
five-dollar bills until you’ve asked the opinion
of some bank teller—it might get you into
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Zowie! what’s that you’re saying, Jack—don’t
tell me they’re off-color bills, counterfeits
in fact. Wouldn’t that be a rotten deal to hand
out, and me figgering how I’d spend them? Is
<i>that</i> what you mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon it’s so, Scotty, much as I hate to
knock your good luck,” Jack told him, with a
shake of his head. “I happened to have a little
experience in a small bank some years ago and
they did say I showed signs of being a clever
detector of bad money. That’s a clever job all
right; but I’m afraid it won’t stand the wash
worth a cent. Go slow, and don’t count your
chickens before they’re hatched. Also I’d advise
you not to go around telling about your windfall
until you’ve shown this stuff to some friendly
bank official, whose advice you’d be willing to
take. If he says it’s good stuff why forget what
I’m saying, and go the limit. But we’d better
be finishing our own job, Perk, and get off on
our jump.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Scotty hung around for a short time, looking
puzzled, as though he hardly knew how much
to believe. What Jack had said in his friendly
fashion had doubtless cast quite a damper on
certain bright dreams in which he had been indulging.
However, he finally decided to take
himself off, evidently eager to know whether
the laugh was on him or not, for he called out:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goodbye, Jack, Perk; and be sure to look me
up when next you drop in at Candler Field Airport;
like as not I’ll still be on my old job here,
unless they decide to transfer me somewhere else.
And say, Jack, I’m meaning to take your advice,
and get an opinion on this here stuff ’fore I try
to pass it out on any old duffer. So-long boys
and luck!”</p>

<p class='c013'>When the two comrades, adventure bound,
found themselves alone they looked at each other
in silence for almost a full minute, when a grin
started to travel over Perk’s well bronzed face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, wouldn’t it jar you though, to have such
luck knock at your door, and then give you a sly
kick?” he demanded of his companion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To tell the honest truth, Perk, I’m not thinking
about Scotty and his queer windfall; it’s
our own great good luck that’s making me suspect
we’re bound to carry this job through with
flying colors.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Eh? now what d’ye mean by saying that?”
asked the other hastily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right in the beginning, Perk, we seem to
have stumbled on a nice little plum in the shape
of a clue—flung directly at our heads, you might
say in the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! do you mean to tell me those bogus
notes were off the same plates we’ve been
hearing so much about lately that I’ve been
dreamin’ I was tied hand an’ foot, an’ poked
under a dozen bales of them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just that, as sure as you live, partner,” said
Jack, composedly; but if he could take it so
coolly, not so his right bower who showed signs
of extreme excitement and satisfaction, for he
thrust out his hand, that had so often been an
object of vast respect on the part of some welter
weight boxer, and insisted that Jack accept a
gentle shake.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re sure Fortune’s favorites,” Perk was
saying, striking an attitude as he thus proudly
spoke; “an’ with such luck hoverin’ over our
heads I vow all the Lower Regions with its devils
can’t prevail against us. But see here, old hoss,
there’s more than chance in this break o’ the
party who broke through Scotty’s door, and
panned all his traps—I guess now he must have
missed a cylinder, an’ jest passed us by in a
ground loop.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was accustomed to the other’s quaint way
of expressing himself, for he lost no time in
adding:</p>

<p class='c013'>“About that way, I take it, Perk. And if
what we suspect turns out to be true, it stands to
reason there’s some sort of big combine back of
it all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“With this same Slippery Slim Garrabrant
pulling the wires for the whole bunch, is that
what you mean, Jack?” demanded the other flyer
quickly; for when once set on the right track
Perk’s mind could travel speedily enough.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s certainly his brain that’s built up this
wide flim-flam trade in the make believe green
stuff that’s been fooling a whole lot of bank tellers,
it’s so near the genuine article. To
smash the combine we’ve got to check up on
Slim; after he’s caged the entire arrangement’s
bound to fall through.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, partner; and them’s my sentiments
every time,” admitted the eager Perk. “And
here, when we’re starting out to pull off our
fresh stunt, I’m wishing all the luck that’s going
to our little game. Meaning to give her a last
checking over, eh, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s a habit of mine, as you know, Perk; and
you might amuse yourself stowing the cargo
we’ve taken aboard, so’s to let us have room for
our feet when we take off. From the looks of
the junk you picked up anybody’d reckon we
planned to go into camp for a week or two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, mebbe that’s what’ll happen to us before
we strike pay dirt in this ticklish job,”
asserted Perk, stoutly. “You know we figgered
things out, and made up our minds this same
slick article of a Slim might have his hangout
over the line in Old Mexico, where he prints
his bad bills, and then comes across the line with
a big bunch in his ship, so’s to scatter the stuff
around to his agents in Texas and Arizona, or
it might be all through Southern California. If
that guess turns out to be a bullseye we might
be away off the line of travel for days at a stretch,
and a grub stake’d turn the trick okay, I’m thinking,
boss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack made no reply, for he was already busily
engaged in looking over his crate. This was, as
he had mentioned, an old habit, contracted in
the early days of his career as an aviator of sorts;
and most likely such extreme caution had saved
his life more than once.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he too worked close by, Perk was thinking
more or less about something that had caught
his ever watchful eye just before they entered
the hangar to make these last preparations for
their southern flight. As usual he was unable
to keep his speculations entirely to himself, since
he always liked to compare notes, and find out
whether his companion’s views coincided with
his own.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, Jack, did you happen to notice that
Ryan ship they’d just taken out of the shed before
ours?” he demanded, while still lifting
packages of various supplies, and stowing them
away in a shipshape fashion; so they would not
be likely to shift, and thus imperil the safety
of himself and comrade, should they chance to
encounter rough weather later on.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not particularly,” came the answer. “I was
too busy over my own affairs to bother with anything
that didn’t concern me in the least. What
of it, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much, old hoss, only it was a next
to new bus, and hadn’t been flown more’n a few
thousand air miles, I’d guess. Couple of fellers
seemed to be the crew, one of ’em lookin’ like
he might be a pilot; and the other a chap that
was out to have a jolly good time sportin’ for
sport. I saw him handlin’ some sort of gun,
which made me guess he was down South for
the shootin’ season—mebbe after bear in the
Louisiana canebrakes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack laughed as if amused, for he had noted
the way in which the other made this stab at
what might be the designs of the unknown
parties.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Feel a bit envious I take it, Perk,” he observed,
laconically. “Always did yearn for the
day to come when you’d have a ship of your
own, and could spend all your spare time jumping
about the country, enjoying yourself with
rod and gun. Cheer up, old sport, you may live
to see that day yet, if things break right for us
in a few big games like this one we’re running
down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thanks for your good luck wishes, Jack,” the
other was saying; “I c’n just picture the bully
times that pair’ll like enough have sitting by
their camp-fire, living on game they’ve knocked
over, and not caring a darn whether school
keeps or not. Oh! well, if I live long enough
mebbe I may have a whiff of that kind of life
before I kick off for keeps; they say everything
comes to the man who waits, and that’s me.
There, that finishes my job, with everything
stowed away as slick as you please. When you’re
ready, Jack, we’ll be on our way.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c014'>CHAPTER III <br /> <br />HEADED SOUTH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Apparently Jack had completed his task
about the same time, for he was adjusting his
’chute harness, without which he seldom made a
long distance flight. This was only second nature
to him, because of the long experience he
had had in barnstorming, and doing stunts for
a living in years gone by.</p>

<p class='c013'>This accomplished, he stepped outside the
hangar, and beckoned to a couple of ground
workers who chanced to be close by, possibly
in anticipation of their services being required,
with a tip in prospect.</p>

<p class='c013'>Between them the ship was moved to the open,
and after that it would be a simple thing for
Jack to taxi across the strip of ground adjoining
the big Pitcairn hangar, so as to face such
wind as was stirring.</p>

<p class='c013'>With what Perk had said concerning the new
Ryan monoplane and its crew still fresh in his
mind, Jack did give a brief glance in that quarter.
He could only see that both men were fully
equipped with dungarees, helmets, and even
chutes fastened to their backs; which combination
was an effectual disguise, since their best
friends might have failed to recognize either
of them offhand.</p>

<p class='c013'>The one who was garbed in what seemed to
be fresh clean overalls, and who must be the
employer, seemed to feel a mild interest in their
movements, for he was looking that way through
his goggles, that had been pulled down as if in
preparation for some species of flight. The
other was busying himself adjusting something,
and from his greasy dungarees it was evident
he must be the working pilot of the Ryan craft.</p>

<p class='c013'>With all the bustle that was going on covering
the stunt flying and speed races, Jack did
not bother taking a second look; he failed to
have the same interest in the possible sporting
excursion of the unknown pair that had gripped
Perk and hence failed to let the matter occupy
any more of his limited time.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon both settled down in their respective
places in the double cockpit of the ship,
Jack of course occupying the front seat, since
he had been placed in command, with the other
acting as co-pilot and observer.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a very decent crate taken in all, that
had been secured for their work on this special
occasion, for Uncle Sam is never stingy in supplying
his agents of the Secret Service with
whatever they need, from means for swift travel
to the customary “grub” necessary to their upkeep
when “on the road.” These air detectives
in whom we are particularly interested just now,
as a rule were angling for big fish, and it was
absolutely necessary they should be given a free
hand when making their demands for proper
backing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it’s goodbye to Candler Field for us
right now,” remarked Perk, as he shot a general
look around, being more or less interested in
the exciting events being pulled off in the air
circus. “Playtime’s past, and now we’ve just
got to put in our best licks along the line of
business. Huh! seems like them two guys are
meaning to pull out right on our heels, from the
lively way that greasy lad is jumping around—keeps
an eye on us in the bargain, as if it mattered
a lick whether we did get going before
he was ready to follow suit. Some folks never
do like anybody to show ’em their dust, even
when it don’t matter a pinch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then Jack waved his hand toward the two
hostlers whom he had generously tipped, and
pulled the gun in his accustomed careful fashion;
after which they started along the level
field for the takeoff, there being small necessity
for a runway on such a generous fairway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Faster and faster they flew along the ground,
and then with their wheels parting contact with
the earth up they started at an easy incline.
The roar of the motor already drowned most of
the clamor from the surging crowd, while the
racket of the whizzing propeller added to the
chorus so joyous to the ears of all real air pilots,
since nothing pleases them more than to feel they
are masters of a ship that is in “apple-pie” condition
for battling whatever lies ahead, be it
storm, fog or whatnot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Somehow Perk was twisting his head around
as if curious to ascertain whether that Ryan
crate had succeeded in imitating their example,
and was already making the preliminary dash
across the field—which luckily enough had
chanced to be fairly clear of maneuvering
planes, either descending, taking off, or being
taxied into position for the next stunt on the
program.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was getting well along by this
time, and already the first dim shadows of approaching
night were to be seen slipping
out from certain patches of pine trees ahead.
But the higher they climbed, now that a start
had been accomplished, the lighter it would become,
what with a lower horizon, and the sun
still hanging in plain sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once free from any possibility of any contact
with the wheeling and ducking planes—some of
which were doing the barrel roll, and others
making successive somersaults, with the daring
pilots proceeding while in an inverted position—Jack
could start spiraling, and climbing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rapidly was Candler Field fading from view
behind them since Jack had swung toward the
south, as if to lay his course directly for New
Orleans. Perk seemed to find a subtle attraction
back where they had just come from, since he
was again turning his head with nothing else to
do save gratify his innocent curiosity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! ’pears like they might be meaning to
strike for the Louisiana canebrake country, and
black bear diggings, just like I said,” he was
telling himself, with a chuckle of amusement
over his shrewd guess. “And say, that little
Ryan crate’s no slouch ’bout making speed, I’d
mention. Come along you sportin’ crowd—plenty
of room in the ceiling overhead, an’ nixey
a chance to bring about a collision. Take your
choice, and cut out for all you’re worth, boys.
If you get there before we do, just tell ’em we’re
acomin’ too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk continued to amuse himself in watching
the antics of the rival ship, and indulging in
all kinds of wild speculations as to what the real
object of those two sporty looking occupants
might prove to be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently thus far not the slightest suspicion
had entered his mind that the taking to the air
of the shining Ryan boat had the first thing to
do with their own skipping out, and heading
toward the Crescent City.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like as not when it gets real dark after a
bit,” Perk continued to say, being addicted to
talking to himself more or less, “we’ll soon lose
her, and have the field all to ourselves. Only
moving thing I c’n sight back there, ’cept them
circlin’ buzzards huntin’ for a carrion supper.
Guess everything’s going along first class
and we’re in for a comfortable night run down
over the corn and sugarcane country. This is
the life for little Perk, you hear me saying,
everybody—it’s got the boxin’ game, and even
that outdoor life up with the Mounties in Canada,
beat to a frazzle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk busied himself with his duties for
some time, and presently became aware of the
fact that evening was actually at hand; for the
sun had dropped out of sight over in the far
west, and looking down he found it absolutely
impossible to distinguish what lay beneath them
some two thousand feet more or less earthward—there
might be forests, farms, hills or swales
following each other in rapid succession; but all
masked by the sable curtains of night. When
the moon rose later on, its light would not afford
them any opportunity for marking any peculiarities
of the ground down there, since it must
simply present the appearance of a swiftly moving
panorama.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, moved once more by his old curiosity
concerning the ship that had started off immediately
after their own jump, again twisted his
head so as to take another backward look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hanged if she ain’t keeping on our tail right
along,” he told himself, as if a bit surprised,
though not in the least troubled, since there
could be no possible connection between this
Ryan monoplane and their own old bus, bent
on reeling off so many miles per hour, and aiming
to make the airport at New Orleans by early
dawn or before, according to how the weather
treated them, and the speed Jack could coax
from his aerial steed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Further inspection convinced Perk that the
rival ship was neither gaining nor losing as the
two sped along their way; a fact that began to
make him “sit up and take notice,” and then
express himself confidentially:</p>

<p class='c013'>“By jinks! it looks to me like that clever little
Ryan bus could make circles around our tub
’less Jack c’n squeeze a lot more snap from our
Whirlwind motor. Now what game c’n that
pair of sports be playin’ right now, I want to
know—must be they’re so used to bettin’ on
anything an’ everything they’re meanin’ to keep
right on our tail all night long, just to make us
hump along, and get the laugh on us poor
guys.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c014'>CHAPTER IV <br /> <br />THE GRIM PURSUER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>As the minutes crept along Perk’s uneasiness
commenced to make itself more manifest, finally
reaching such a condition that he felt it would
ease his mind if only he could get the opinion
of his companion on the subject.</p>

<p class='c013'>To do this it would be necessary that they
should make use of the head earphones that had
been taken along for this particular purpose.
Accordingly he quickly adjusted his own, and
then proceeded to advise Jack as to what he
wished to do. Since these useful adjuncts of the
pilot’s outfit were so arranged that they could
be slipped on and off with little loss of time,
it was an easy matter for Perk to apply them,
after which he went on to speak.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, seems like that pesky little Ryan insect’s
been tailing us right along, though mebbe
now you didn’t notice it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know it, Perk—fact is I proved that fact
to my own satisfaction, for twice now I’ve
changed our course, once into the west, and
again heading into the southwest, even if it
didn’t catch your attention.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You did that same; and say, what happened,
Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a blessed thing,” came the immediate
answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They still hung on our tail, do you mean,
old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like they did—queer how two pilots,
strangers both, would take a notion to change
their course, not once but twice running,” commented
Jack in his non-committal fashion that
always had Perk guessing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Strikes me as something more than a happy
chance,” asserted Perk, beginning to throw off
that comfortable feeling with which he had
wrapped himself as he contemplated a steady
going night run, with never a reason for anything
gripping them by way of excitement;
“ev’ry little movement of that Ryan two-seater’s
got a meanin’ of its own. Now what ails the
ducks I want to know—how c’n our movements
have a mite to do with what they’re planning
to carry out—got any idea along them lines, old
hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing definite as yet,” answered Jack; “I
was starting to figure it out just when you barged
in, and opened this talk fest up with your question.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, come to think of it, what did you make
out of that stiff yarn Scotty put over on us a
while ago?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was raw stuff for a fact; but I don’t question
anything he told us, remember, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whoever his mysterious visitor was he must
have been hunting for something, that’s dead
sure!” declared Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Something he didn’t find, either,” continued
Jack’s assistant pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Scotty was ready to swear to that fact, and
he ought to know.” Jack countered by saying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“But see here, old hoss, you’ve got some sorter
idea what the game might abeen, haven’t you
for a fact?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon I know why the sneak thief failed
to carry away the thing he was looking for, if
that’s what you mean, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As what, boss—I’m all worked up wantin’
to know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perhaps the reason might have been because
the object of his search happened at that very
time to be safe and snug in the inside pocket
of this same coat I’m wearing under my overalls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At hearing this startling announcement Perk
gave a quick look into his pal’s face, there being
just enough light remaining in the western sky
to allow this searching glance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! now I’m beginning to get somewhere,
and ready to quit this gropin’ around,
like a man in a London fog—that letter you had
this very morning from Headquarters—somehow
’r other some of the gang had wind of your
gettin’ it, and they guessed it’d be kept
safe under lock and key in your room at the
hotel; and then they got balled up about the
number on the door, so they broke into the wrong
room. Jack, am I on the right track?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems that’s so, according to my notion,
Perk; unless I miss my guess that’s the way
things stand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A disgusted grunt from Perk told that he did
not feel very happy over certain facts in the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gosh-a-mighty!” he burst out, explosively,
“if that’s right, then the tricky crowd know you’n
me are on this case—that even right now we’re
starting out to pluck their tail feathers, and
fetch that master-crook to the bar!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! I expected that would happen,” said
Jack, indifferently. “Having been told by several
of the best men in the service that Slim was
the smartest all-round dopester known in all the
land, I anticipated that he’d have means for
finding out that fact long ago—that there might
be a leak around Headquarters; for spies can
worm in almost anywhere, given an opportunity,
and the backing of a big bunch of jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yet that fact don’t seem to rattle you worth
a red cent, old hoss,” continued the puzzled
Perk, who ofttimes found the actions of his cool
partner a mystery he could not solve, because of
his own more impetuous ways.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope not,” was all Jack said in reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thunder and lightning!” ejaculated the co-pilot,
as if an illuminating idea had suddenly
flashed through his brain—“that Ryan bus,
Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what of it?” demanded the one at the
stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What if that sporty guy I told you about
should turn out to be the critter who broke into
Scotty’s room, and made it a complete wreck?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It could happen that way, Perk; seems like
you’re working on a warm scent right now. Pity
we didn’t get a good look at the gentleman before
he hid his face behind that helmet and goggles;
then at least we’d know him if ever we happened
to run across his trail.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The other was almost frothing at the mouth
through disgust and anger combined; but he
managed to say, with a select few hard words
interlarded as a vent to his outraged feelings:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Give me half a chance and I’ll mark him so
there’s be no difficulty in locating the sneak when
we meet him again—I’d put a bit of lead
through his arm that’d keep him out of the scrap
for a week of Sundays; or else clip off one of
his ears, to stamp him as a low-down crook.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack knew full well that this was no idle threat
on the part of his running mate; for Perk had a
reputation as a pistol shot second to none in the
entire service, being a natural born marksman.</p>

<p class='c013'>He lapsed into a spell of silence after making
that vicious remark; but from the way he
glanced back again and again it looked as
though Perk meant to keep close tabs on the
craft that was dogging their own ship so
steadily.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were roaring on their way, and it would
seem as if they must be showing a clean pair of
heels to anything in their rear; but just the same,
Perk, with the vision of an air-minded individual,
could readily understand how the speedy
Ryan plane was slowly but insidiously picking
up on them continuously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blamed nuisance,” he was muttering to himself
when this important fact became a positive
truth; “guess now that rip-snorter could make
circles round us, if so be he wanted to. Shucks!
what’s left to us I want to know; an’ just what
does he ’spect to accomplish with all this chasin’
us? Might as well get out my little old
six-shot bear gun, so’s to be ready in case
there’s any sort o’ ruction aheadin’ our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The idea seemed to afford him a strange sort
of grim satisfaction, for bending down he ran
his hand under the coaming of the cockpit; to
almost immediately withdraw a very decent
looking sporting repeating rifle, evidently his
working tool whenever he felt disposed to spend
a week in the wilds, either alone, or with some
boon companions also yearning for wild game
and the much desired campfire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold tight, Perk,” Jack was saying just
then; “going into a nose dive, and see if that
will upset his calculations; for he’s got me buffaloed
all right as to what’s in the wind!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Almost immediately they turned the nose of
their craft earthward, and went down on a
swift slant. Perk kept his head turned even as
this maneuvre was being executed, and what he
saw was something calculated to almost take
his breath away; for where the pursuing Ryan
ship loomed up as a shadowy form, vivid
splashes, as of fire, were coming in quick succession—he
could even imagine he heard the pulsating
staccato reports following each other in
succession, just as in those never-to-be-forgotten
days when he would have a covey of
devil-may-care German air fighters stepping on
the tail of his old-fashioned boat, and peppering
him from their rapid-firing guns!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c014'>CHAPTER V <br /> <br />THE DUEL IN THE AIR</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The significant flashes abruptly ceased; but
Perk realized this was only because the expert
pilot handling that same Ryan wasp was also
ducking down in an exact copy of their own
game.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the moment Perk lost sight of the shadowy
pursuing craft; then Jack changed his tactics,
and once again brought his boat on an even
keel. Perk strained his eyesight in an endeavor
to pick up the other ship after it too had swung
into a direct course.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Devil take that guy at the stick,” he stormed
to himself, although Jack caught almost every
word, since the earphones were still in operation,
“he’s seen our move, an’ gone us one better.
No slouch o’ a pilot, either, I’ll admit. When
that gent who goes by the name o’ Slippery Slim
picks his gang he knows how to pull trumps
out of the pack all right. Give him another
shoot, Jack, old hoss; mebbe he wont be so lucky
next time. He’s got some kind o’ a rapid-fire
shooter aboard, and had started to send a hail
o’ lead ’bout our ears just as you turned the trick
on him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was apparently quite willing to give a
repeat, for hardly had the other ceased shouting
than they again shot down in a dizzy dive
that seemed likely to lower their altitude by
something like five hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was keeping a close watch, and knew
that once more the grim pursuer had copied
their daring maneuvre.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s a good one, or I’ll eat my hat!” he burst
out, as they were “cutting a blue streak” once
more through the growing darkness, and he
could see those suggestive flashes again punctuating
the gloom in their track. “Jack, he’s
started that racket again, don’t you know; and
any second we may get a slug in our belly, bustin’
things all to flinders. Try a razzle-dazzle on
the boob, old broncho!”</p>

<p class='c013'>So making a bank, Jack changed his course,
running at right angles, and if anything at a
faster pace than ever. Perk had the situation
“sized up to a fraction,” as he himself would
have called it; he realized that it was only
through the greatest of good luck they had escaped
being hit by one of those flying missiles;
and that so long as the mysterious enemy kept
using their ship for a flying target they were in
constant peril. Despite all this ducking and
dodging on Jack’s part he did not seem successful
in throwing the pursuing craft off the track.
To be sure the darkness was gradually growing
thicker with every passing minute, and this
seemed to be their only hope of crawling out of
a “hot hole,” according to Perk’s calculations.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk afterwards frankly admitted that he was
frothing at the mouth on account of finding himself
up against a situation where the cards
seemed stacked against him—where his hands
were tied as it were, and that reckless pilot, chasing
after them hell-bent, held all the trumps.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No use tryin’ that game any longer, Jack,
boy!” he yelled suddenly. “See the glim all
’round us, partner—sure as you live they’ve
even got some kind o’ a searchlight aboard, just
like they’d planned all this thing out beforehand.
Guess now it’s up to Little Perk to put
a plug into their game. Hold her steady a bit,
boss; I’m meaning to make ’em sit up an’ take
notice they can’t hog <i>all</i> the fun going. Watch
my smoke, Jack, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a delicate situation without any doubt;
for if those aboard that little Ryan plane, taking
advantage of the halo of light covering the craft
they followed, continued to make use of their
rapidfire gun, the danger of a hit had vastly increased;
but Perk must have some sort of scheme
in mind it was evident, or he would never have
asked his chum to steady the badly wobbling
boat when such action only doubled their peril.</p>

<p class='c013'>Calmly and deliberately, as though simply
bent on fetching down a deer he wanted for
his next camp supper, steady old Perk had his
faithful gun up to his shoulder, and was sighting
that piercing glare of light that marked the bow
of the pursuing aircraft, betraying the presence
of a searchlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Possibly owing to the clamor of their own
working motor Jack could not tell when his
companion unloosed a fusilade of shots; but he
did know that something suddenly changed the
situation, and to their advantage; for as though
a blanket had been tossed over the piercing
ray the illumination abruptly ceased, leaving
them to continue their wild flight shrouded in
encompassing darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, too, the sound of Perk’s exulting yell
was quite enough to tell the story of his success
in finding a glowing target for one of his several
missiles—the old sharpshooter had evidently
lost none of his cunning by reason of a lapse in
action.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Set ’em up in the other alley, boys—give your
Dutch uncle a chance to show an old trick or
two! Now <i>will</i> you be good, or must I give
you another smash in the jaw—better haul off
while the haulin’s good, fellers—I’d sure hate to
make you crack up, and fade out!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Even though his clever shot had doubtless
utterly smashed the searchlight, and put it out
of business, that bothersome rapidfire gun was
still in working order, as Perk discovered when
once more those insistent flashes, following closely
upon each others’ heels, announced a fresh
barrage, with the unseen, unheard hissing bullets
doubtless whizzing all around them.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was adding insult to injury, Perk was
doubtless telling himself, as he realized that his
lucky shot had after all failed to daunt that
stubborn pair in the speedy Ryan ship.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You <i>will</i> have it, seems like,” he growled
to himself; for since he had discarded his earphone
harness just previous to starting his late
“shooting spree,” Perk could no longer hold
intercourse with his fellow flyer; “all right then,
I’ll try some more o’ the same sorter medicine;
what’s good for the goose orter be fine for the
gander. Mind your eye now, boys, and keep
a tight grip on your chutes if anything happens
not down in your gamble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again did the continual flash of spitting fire
from the gun afford the sharpshooter in the
chased ship abundant opportunities for focussing
his aim; although instinct may have
taken the place of vision on Perk’s part.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fortunately Jack must have been expecting
something along those lines, knowing his companion
so well, and how he was always eager
to “repeat” when things were coming his way;
for he kept the flying boat wonderfully steady
just then, even though realizing how such action
doubled their own chances of being hit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was now shooting on general principles,
in hopes of being fortunate enough to find a
billet for one of his random bullets. He went
at the business with all the <i>sang froid</i> of a veteran
fighter, accustomed to meeting hostile
craft up in the wide air spaces, or even above
the clouds—all the fierce delight of matching
his skill and life against a foeman worthy of his
steel had once more gripped the old flying warrior;
and it may be for the moment he deluded
himself with the belief that this was but a reincarnation
of those never-to-be-forgotten days
when all Europe was held fast in the throes of
the grisly war-god.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly Perk ceased firing, nor was this
caused by the magazine of his repeating rifle
being empty—he had seen that the discharges
back yonder were no longer in full blast, showing
that something must have happened to cause
such a sudden cessation to hostilities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before he could attempt to analyze what this
might mean it was all flashed before his questioning
mind—a burst of flames came from the
spot where last he had seen the shadowy shape
of their persistent pursuer clipping through
space like a blazing meteor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk sat there doubled up, his mouth half
open, staring with might and main, as some
object began to drop toward the earth with ever
increasing speed—something which he knew
full well must of necessity be the beautiful little
Ryan plane, which he had admired so much
when at Candler Field at close of the late day,
and before this wild dash into the darkness of
night began.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently one of his missiles (fired with such
grim determination when he “took the bit in
his teeth,” and struck back) had found its mark,
and unleashed the dangerous contents of the
gasoline reservoir, with the splashing fluid instantly
catching fire from the exploding spark
of the running motor.</p>

<p class='c013'>No flyer ever saw his enemy going down in a
flaming coffin without feeling compassion gripping
him; that one moment had changed his
heart from bitter hatred to a sense of pity; knowing
as he must have done that the day might
be near at hand when he too would share in a
similar dreadful fate.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so Perk found himself all in a nervous
tremble as, laying down his gun, he managed
once more to adjust the head harness, so as to
be able to again hold communication with his
fellow adventurer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c014'>CHAPTER VI <br /> <br />PARACHUTE JUMPERS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Just then Jack hurriedly banked, and swung
around as though to double back on their late
course. This of course told Perk the pilot must
be already aware of the terrible tragedy that
was being enacted close at hand, and meant to
see its finish with his own eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the abrupt change in their course he
was in time to catch a glimpse of the flaming
object still spiraling earthwards, a billow of fire
that glowed suggestively in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then far below it seemed to strike the ground—they
heard no sound whatever, but the fire
became stationary; although increasing in fury,
since the wind created by its passage no longer
whipped the devouring flames. Evidently by
the time the conflagration stopped for want of
further material on which to feed, nothing inflammable
would be left of the once haughty
little Ryan masterpiece save the engine, and
other metal parts.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the big idea, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk asked this as a leader, wishing to get a
better grip on his own nerves, since they had
been dreadfully shocked at the dire result of his
random shot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Going to circle around a few times, and drop
down a bit,” came the illuminating reply;
“though I reckon it’s no use, since nothing could
live in all that awful blast.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe not, Jack,” remarked Perk, a bit
cheerily; “but there’s a fair chance neither o’
them guys got snagged in the flash o’ that gas.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Perk, have you some foundation
for saying that?” demanded the other, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure—they jumped all right, boss,” Perk
told him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You saw them do it then, did you, boy?”
continued Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They bailed out okay—I saw two take the
jump right after the first flash came—went down
like plummets in the bargain—smart lads those
guys are, I’m tellin’ you, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>No doubt Jack was glad to hear this bit of
news, for it had filled him with horror to realize
that in order to escape they had been compelled
to ruthlessly take human life. He was
much younger than Perk, veteran of the World
War, who had grown more or less hardened
to such happenings when staking his own life
against that of a tricky German air pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Still goin’ down, are you?” asked Perk shortly
afterwards, on finding that they were still
swinging around in a wide circle, that burning
pyre far below being the hub of the wheel of
which their boat was the outer tire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Might as well,” came the ready answer,
showing that Jack had made up his mind
hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess now they’ll get down somehow, boss;
a whole lot depends on what kind o’ landin’
they’ll be able to make—if its rocks, or trees,
they got to strike it’s apt to be some hard sleddin’
for the boys. Say, ’taint possible now you’re
fixin’ to try an’ lend ’em a helpin’ hand? I’d
hate to know they’d been wiped off the map in
that hot fire; but somehow I don’t feel like
playin’ the part o’ the Good Samaritan to such
man devils as them two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No danger of my trying to make a landing
where the chances are ten to one it just <i>can’t</i> be
done,” explained Jack, seeing that his companion
was almost ready to mutiny if any such mad
proceeding were contemplated. “I’d just feel
better if I knew they’d reached ground okay;
then we could keep on our way, and it’d be up
to them to get out of the scrape.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! I get you, partner,” grunted the relieved
Perk. “Don’t think I’m bitter about the
thing, ’cause they’re sure hot stuff all right; but
I’m a bit slow to accept that forgive and forget
stuff, specially after any guy’s tried his level
best to gimme a dirty deal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll try the thing out while on the job,”
Jack announced. “Our own wonderful escape
from meeting just that same kind of fate makes
me kind of soft. Perhaps we’ll not be able to
learn a single thing; you know how it often is
when you’ve finally struck ground after quitting
the ship by the chute route—all out of breath—sometimes
knocked up a bit, if you escape broken
bones—not any shape to shout, or do anything
but just lie there, and suck in the air in big
gasps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, that’s right for you, old hoss,” Perk
readily agreed. “Me, I once got a collar bone
smashed that way. No harm in our makin’ a
few swings around these diggin’s ’fore we put
out for Orleans. That fire keeps burnin’ like
things they got sprinkled right well with the
juice when the tank blew up. Go to it, Jack,
just as you please, never mindin’ a few squeals
from a hard-boiled guy like Perk Perkiser.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m going to shut down on the engine, and
take a little glide, so we can pick up anything
like a yell,” announced the pilot a minute later.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to it—duck then, boy!” snapped Perk,
as he temporarily relieved himself of his ear-phones
in order to catch anything bordering on
a shout from the ground below.</p>

<p class='c013'>The simple expedient was carried out successfully,
and when once again they leveled out,
to continue circling, Jack asked eagerly:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get anything, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a bleat, partner,” replied the other, who
had hurriedly held his earphones in position so
as to cover the emergency.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sorry for that, but we’ll try a couple more
times before calling it all off,” suggested Jack,
who could be more or less persistent when the
occasion arose for such action, though never
carrying it so far as to be reckless.</p>

<p class='c013'>So a dozen seconds or so afterwards he again
gave warning that it was time for another drop
of a few hundred feet—not that they meant to
take any chances by getting too close to the unknown
terrain lying in the pitch blackness under
the flying ship; but simply to be able to listen
with the horrid clamor of the bustling engine
momentarily stilled.</p>

<p class='c013'>No better success followed this second maneuvre—all
was deathly silent around, above,
below, as though never a solitary living human
being existed within miles of the spot where
the destruction of the Ryan monoplane had
taken place.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll give a third and last try,” was Jack’s
announced decision, to which Perk added:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Three times, and batter’s out—by then I rather
guess we’ll be down close enough to the solid
ground to make another drop dangerous. Either
way I’m satisfied we’ve done the right thing,
old hoss. Suit yourself when you see fit to
coast,” whereupon he once more denuded his
ears of the exceedingly useful and really indispensable
phone harness, to await the occasion
of the last try in the line of an aviator’s
duty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it, Perk?—get a whisper?”</p>

<p class='c013'>They had completed the glide, and were once
more on a level course, with Jack even turning
the nose of the ship a bit heavenward; since
neither of them knew what the nature of the
ground below must be—whether some hill lay
directly ahead, against which they might smash
for a complete wipeout.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! a heap more’n that, partner!” came
the triumphant reply. “Heard a shout, an’ then
another some distance off—struck me both
jumpers had lit okay, and were tryin’ to communicate,
so’s to get together again. Guess
things ain’t so bad after all with them guys, an’
we c’n be movin’ on our way without botherin’
any more ’bout their safety. Some two-legged
varmints seem to be watched over by Old Satan
hisself, they bein’ that venomous, and evil-minded.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack made no rejoinder to this remark, tinged
with bitterness as it was, only pointed the nose
of his craft upward, and started to spiral for
altitude. Undoubtedly he was feeling greatly
relieved because of their having escaped so
miraculously from the hovering peril; and best
of all managed to turn the tables on those who
would have encompassed their destruction just
in order to defend the lawless game in which
they were engaged in connection with Slippery
Slim.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk must have been doing a little hard thinking
as the time passed and they raced on their
way, for later on he started to speak; and as
usual his line of chatter told that he was seeking
information, trying to find a solution of
certain exasperating puzzles that were “twisting
his intellects,” as he himself described
matters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Things kind o’ got me goofy, partner, an’
I’d like you to raise the curtain some, if so be
you feel so bent. First place I guess it goes
without questionin’ that these huskies must be
in cohunks with that there big gun, Slippery
Slim Garrabrant?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! that’s a dead certainty—who else would
have any reason for waylaying us in Atlanta,
and setting up this trap for us to fall into?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! then it stands to reason, boss, he’s
got means for findin’ out what the Secret Service
aims to do; an’ so has been able to play the boys
for suckers every time they set out to lay him
by the heels, eh, Jack, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s past history, Perk; even the Big Boss
got wise to it, and tried everything possible to
learn where the great leak happened; but our
experience proves they haven’t discovered it so
far. I’m making up my mind that the closer
we draw to the headquarters of this rotten clique
of crime, where they make the bogus long-green
that’s been flooding the whole West for a year
and more, why, the harder our job is bound
to be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which tickles me a heap, boy—I’m just
yearnin’ for comin’ to grips with that gazaboo
o’ a Slim; and now we’re on to the job I’ll never
be happy ’till he’s on his way to that big Government
pen we glimpsed in Atlanta, where
some other lads we helped to pinch are doin’
time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if you keep on as you’ve started, Perk,
we’ll flatten the whole gang like pancakes—they’ve
stacked up against a new sort of revenue
dog when they started a shooter of your calibre
on the trail. First you smashed their searchlight,
and then sent a chuck of lead into the
gas tank that broke up the game. That’s the
kind of a pinch hitter you are, partner; and
right now I want to congratulate you on such
dandy marksmanship.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lay off that stuff, Jack—nothin’ but great
luck fetched the bacon home for this lad. But
me, I’m shakin’ hands with myself ’cause I
had that hunch a bear gun mightn’t be such a
bad thing to tote along on a trip that’s goin’ to
carry us across the border, an’ into Old Mex,
like as not; where the greasers are sometimes
tough nuts an’ hard to handle they tell me.
’Spose we’ll run across them two hill billies
again, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wouldn’t surprise me a bit if we did,” replied
the pilot, leveling off at a three thousand
foot ceiling, and still heading due southwest.
“Like as not they’ve got plenty of ready cash
along; and after having been so cleverly upset in
their calculations, due to your beating them silly
with a barrage of hot lead, they’ll be hot to wipe
out their disgrace. Oh! yes, we’re going to run
up against that foxey pair again before the book
is closed for keeps.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c014'>CHAPTER VII <br /> <br />STRIKING THE FOG BELT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>With the stars shining brightly above them,
and a moon just past its full climbing the eastern
heavens, having dissipated the darkness of the
earlier part of the night, Jack and his fellow
voyager continued plunging along in a very
satisfactory fashion, having no reason for feeling
further concern regarding the peril to
which they had been so lately subjected.</p>

<p class='c013'>But things were not destined to continue so
comfortably for the two adventurers, it seemed.
Perk was just congratulating himself for about
the fourth time at having such a comfortable
flight, when he sat up and took notice of the
fact that those heavenly bodies were beginning
to look exceedingly hazy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Danged shame, that’s what, to spoil such a
dandy night!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What ails you now?” demanded Jack, on
hearing the other make this little remark that
bespoke exasperation at least; “another boat on
our tail?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I guess not just now,” replied Perk,
scoffingly; “one was more’n enough for a single
jump. But we’re agoin’ to run into a pesky
fog belt, sure as you’re born, old hoss!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That all?” laughed the other, who apparently
saw nothing of particular consequence
about such a common happening; “it may perhaps
manage to slow us down more or less; but
what does that matter, when we’ve got time to
burn. The Big Boss told us, remember, not to
hurry things at all—plenty of time, oodles of
money, and any backing we chose to call for in
the way of a new boat, or more helpers. We
should worry, old scout!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Tain’t that in peticular Jack,” complained
the other; “but of all things a sky detective’s got
to run smack up against, fog’s the one I despise
most. It’s got me in bad more’n a few times, so
I’ve grown to look on the peasoup stuff like it
was my—er, what-dye-call it—Nebraska, no, I
mean Nemesis.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, now you mention it, Perk, I remember
you telling me something about that strange feeling
you have creep over you. No need for you
to apologize—in my knocking around among airmen
I’ve found that often even the most daring
and reckless in the bunch had some kind of a
weakness, if only you looked far enough under
the surface; just as sometimes you’ll find a boasting
bully actually afraid of his little wife at
home, who’s smacked him with her handy rolling
pin many a time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! wasn’t I a canvas man ’long with a
travelin’ circus a wheen o’ years ago, an’ didn’t
I see the biggest elephant in captivity rear up
on his hind legs, lift his trunk sky-high in the
air, an’ squeal like fun just when a little half
grown mouse happened to run along near his
alley. Well, I’m the tusker, an’ fog is the
mouse, as you might say—we never do get on
well as a combine. Hope it hugs the ground,
an’ leaves us a clear track up among the clouds
I c’n see creepin’ up ahead yonder.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Doesn’t bother me a whit, partner; don’t
forget we’ve got that new radio beacon aboard
to try out; and if it’s as clever as I’ve heard tell
it’ll carry us along our route to Orleans through
the thickest nest of fog anybody ever stacked up
against. Naturally we can’t expect to get the
full benefit of its capacity to hold a speeding
plane on its true course; because the invention’s
hardly more than half baked up to now; but I
set it according to directions, and if at any time
we begin to slide off our course the light that
springs up is bound to give warning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A bully good layout I’d say, if it c’n do what
they claim,” ventured Perk, who undoubtedly
had read certain things concerning the new invention,
and was eager to learn just how it would
pan out. “You showed a level head, partner,
when you decided to take the offer o’ that gent
in Atlanta, and try the thing out. Guess, then,
I needn’t bother my head ’bout gettin’ astray;
if things keep bein’ invented it ain’t goin’ to be
very long till a pilot’ll get slapped good an’
hard if he misses runnin’ on a straight line, or
even veers from his proper course in a great big
blow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re living in a machine age, Perk, and
every day things are heading that way on the
run—electric helps in kitchen, factory, and even
aboard our air cruisers. While the brainwork
and strain grow harder the actual manual labor
is lessened all the time. But as you say it’s getting
a bit hazy, and chances are we’re in for a
spell of blue fog.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Ten minutes afterwards there could not be
the least doubt concerning that fact, for by degrees
even the stars vanished from view, ditto
the gorgeous round moon. Still, since the sky
remained brighter in the east, it was not at all
difficult to tell where the fair mistress of the
Southern night had hidden her face behind the
opaque veil.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was now flying by instruments alone,
since never a thing could be seen by the keenest
eye above, below—they seemed to be hung in
unlimited space; but pushing along with considerable
speed just the same, bound for the distant
city on the vast Mississippi, situated not so
very far from its delta.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus passed a full hour.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly Perk saw a small light spring into
view on one side of the plane, and it certainly
electrified him considerably.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hi! there, partner, we’re off our track—shifted
to the east, seems like, unless I’m away
wrong in sizin’ things up ’cordin’ to Hoyle.
Got to swing her to the larboard-watch side, I
kinder guess—how ’bout that, boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You hit it that time, Perk, and here she goes
to climb back to our true course. Worked just
as we figured it would, and put us wise to a fact
we’d hardly have picked up in any other way.
I reckon now this same radio beacon’s bound to
turn out a great help to the poor badgered air
pilot, flying blind when fog hides the ground
beacons, and he gets no aid from the heavens
above.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll say it’s the best thing I’ve struck for a
long time,” affirmed the delighted Perk.
“There she goes—the glim I mean—closed shop,
havin’ ’complished the business set for her;
showing we must have struck our real course
again.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Easy money,” laughed Jack, just as well satisfied.
“Makes a fellow sit up and try to guess
what the next big idea connected with aviation
will prove to be; doesn’t seem to be any limit to
the dazzling discoveries these scientific chaps’ll
turn out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, partner—like that big chute they’re
trying out, which they claim will keep any
plane from crashing—if the engine goes dead
all you got to do is to press a little button, and
when the drop comes open goes the monster umbrella,
able to hold you and the crate suspended
in the air, to gradually fall to the earth like the
colored balls from a bursted skyrocket. Great
stunt that, an’ I’m livin’ in hopes it’ll be my
luck to some day find myself aboard a ship that’s
equipped with such a giant chute, an’ have the
glorious experience of seeing the thing work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack seemed to consider it the part of wisdom
to pull up more or less, as they were in no hurry,
and could drop down on the aviation field at
New Orleans by dawn, even though they concluded
to just “loaf along.” Disliking anything
pertaining to fog Perk naturally said nothing
to hint at a desire for further speed; besides
his own good sense told him that what his mate
had just said with regard to no necessity existing
for haste, was sound logic, and a due regard
for “safety first.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So the time slipped away, with midnight finding
them past the meridian of their projected
flight. Perk had long since subsided and
seemed content to sit there in the double cockpit,
letting his thoughts roam back to the exciting
developments of the earlier night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Years had elapsed since last he watched a
doomed plane writhing and twisting in its death
agonies, with the flames wrapping it in an envelope—a
blazing coffin speeding headlong to a
final crash; and here, strange to say, after all
that time intervening he had again passed
through a similar experience. Now that he had
an opportunity to calmly review the happening,
Perk admitted he was pleased to know the two
occupants of the Ryan cockpit had apparently
escaped a miserable fate that must have been
laid at his door.</p>

<p class='c013'>Two A. M. and all’s well!</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk figured that when a few more times
sixty minutes had passed it would be time for
them to catch a first glimpse of the great rolling
turgid stream that could, when the heavy rains
united with the melting snows up in the mountains
of the Far West, create vast floods that
placed much of the low country along the river
under many feet of water. It had been a long
time since last Perk had set eyes on the Mississippi,
and hence he was considerably worked
up over the prospect of soon glimpsing the
mighty flood.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c014'>CHAPTER VIII <br /> <br />NEW ORLEANS—FIRST STOP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“There she rolls, Jack, old boy—the greatest
stream in the whole U.S.A.—I swan if she
don’t look just as fine as when I glimpsed her
for the first time many years ago!”</p>

<p class='c013'>That was Perk’s tribute on beholding the
Lower Mississippi perhaps thirty miles above
New Orleans; he displayed almost as much enthusiasm
as those early discoverers did centuries
back, when their distended eyes took in the
mighty sweep of the flood rolling down toward
its junction with the Mexican Gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was early dawn, and the fog bank had been
dissipated by a fresh breeze acting as advance
courier to the rising of the sun. Jack, looking
toward the southwest could also see the object
of his companion’s exultation, and undoubtedly
felt some of the same pleasure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When it gets a bit lighter we’ll have a far distant
view of the city, with its smoke cloud hovering
over it,” he remarked, knowing that soft coal
and southern pine as used for fuel in the Fall
and Winter seasons always caused something of
a pall to mark the site of the river metropolis.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk reached around, and drew forth a case
that on being opened disclosed a pair of pretty
decent binoculars, with which they had been
fitted out by the Washington authorities before
starting on this particular man-hunt, with an
idea that they might prove most useful sooner
or later.</p>

<p class='c013'>After clapping these to his eyes Perk announced
that he could easily pick up the goal
of their flight from Candler Field; although the
smoke did act as a screen, through which it was
not possible to see with certainty.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was now bringing out all the reserve
speed of their ship—it was of some consequence
that they make a landing as early as possible,
since he had no desire to attract undue attention,
and possibly have inquisitive newspaper reporters
to be asking pertinent questions as to
whence they came, what their identities might
be when at home, and also concerning the object
of their coming to New Orleans. Secrecy
was the foundation on which they meant to
build their plans; and from their previous experience
with those dare devils in the employ of
Slippery Slim, too much care could not be employed
in order to mask their batteries.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, too, as they approached the city Jack was
dropping down to lower levels; while on his part
Perk skimmed the whole scene, looking for the
airport they knew to be somewhere within reach
of their vision.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being presently located he called his
chum’s attention to the open field, and in almost
no time they were circling it, looking for the
best place to land.</p>

<p class='c013'>Early though it was there were moving figures
circulating around, while some sort of ship
was coming in from over the river—possibly one
of the air mail carriers from a distant station, it
might be many hundred miles away, fetching
Uncle Sam’s important letter sacks, and worthwhile
express matter, at treble the speed that the
fastest train could muster.</p>

<p class='c013'>The landing was effected without the slightest
difficulty, and hardly had their boat come
to a stop than a number of persons, most of them
connected with the ground force of mechanicians
and hostlers, surrounded the incoming
craft, paying but scant attention to the air mail,
which dropped down almost at the same moment—that
was a daily happening, a following
out of a regular schedule, to which they had
become accustomed; while the arrival of a mysterious
plane might stand for almost anything.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold fast, Perk!” said Jack, as he took off
his headphones, and raising his voice to almost
a shout, so deaf did he appear after a whole
night’s run; “don’t tumble out yet; and keep a
muffler on your gab, for we’ve got to let ’em
take it out in guessing. I’ll soon see if the
party we’re expecting to meet is on hand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He still kept his helmet and goggles in position
as he thrust his head out of the cockpit, and
raising his right hand with two fingers extended,
made a species of salute. A stout man,
with a very red face, and an air of importance,
immediately pushed through the gathering
crowd, and answered Jack’s signal with a similar
sweep of his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s okay, Perk—that’s our party, and he’s
been watching for us, showing he had my wire
last evening. Get a move on, and we’ll soon be
doubling our legs under a breakfast table.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! but that will be a joy to me,
old hoss!” Perk exclaimed; “’cause I’m as
hungry as a wolf, an’ the smell o’ coffee is apt
to set me wild. Go to it, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was paying no attention to these vaporings,
since it was a common occurrence to have
old Perk declare the bottom of his stomach was
in danger of falling out—he had met the red-faced
gentleman and they were shaking hands
as they exchanged a few words.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all fixed, comrade,” he said to Perk over
his shoulder, mentioning no names lest suspicious
ears catch them, and thus have a clue as
to their identity; “we’ll get a few of these boys
to run our boat into a hangar close by, which is
waiting for us, and then cut out for the city—and grub.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This being speedily carried out, with the
doors fastened securely, and the two flyers began
to hastily divest themselves of their working
“duds.” Before ten minutes had passed
they were on their way in a taxi the gentleman
friend had brought out, with Jack and their
host talking at a great rate; while as for Perk
he was looking out, and finding more or less enjoyment
in seeing new and novel sights along
the road.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk having been well coached as to the
necessity for caution, made it a practice to snatch
an occasional glance in their rear, looking for
any signs to indicate that their car was being
trailed; but nothing at all suspicious came to
his attention.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meantime Jack had learned that their new
friend (whose name he already knew to be Mr.
Adkins) was connected with the Administration
forces of the United States District Attorney,
having offices in the Government building—that
he had been secretly advised of their coming
days before receiving Jack’s wire; and was
ready to give them all the information possible
concerning what had been learned in connection
with the wholesale operations of the man they
had been sent out to cage, so as to effectually
remove the greatest menace that had threatened
business men of the Southwest in a decade.</p>

<p class='c013'>In due time he would post them regarding
all these important facts; meanwhile they
could take things easy, for there was no hurry,
and the game was of too much importance to
allow lax methods. When they got good and
ready they could make a start, and after that
everything must depend on their ability to beat
Slippery Slim at his favorite game of “dog eat
dog.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He steered his guests to a certain restaurant
where he knew they could be well taken care
of, and which turned out to be close to the hotel
at which they booked under fictitious names.
Here Perk was given the privilege of ordering
just what he desired along the line of rashers of
bacon and fried eggs; cornbread with syrup;
several cups of coffee taken black; and to top off
with, a Havana cigar such as he was not accustomed
to smoking, being addicted to the more
friendly pipe habit.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no talk of shop while they partook
of breakfast; such business as they had to transact
was of too delicate a nature to be discussed
in a public place, where strangers would be
coming and going, and spying eyes might be on
them every minute of the time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Later they gathered in the room at the hotel
where, behind closed and locked doors they felt
free to confer in lowered tones.</p>

<p class='c013'>Much had to be told, and numerous thrilling
accounts brought out connected with adventures
experienced by other Secret Service men in their
efforts to round up the notorious gang—all of
which had resulted in absolute defeat for the
Government agents.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shrewd men some of these parties undoubtedly
were, with a record of numerous famous
cases successfully carried through; but somehow
when they found themselves up against
Slippery Slim Garrabrant they sooner or later
fell down on the job, and had to be recalled.</p>

<p class='c013'>In fact, it was disclosed to Jack and his pal,
two different agents were never again heard
from, after secret code messages had been received
from them to the effect that they were
even then getting very close to a great discovery
that must end in the arrest of the malefactor—a
dead silence that had never been broken
seemed to signify that they must have fallen into
some sort of fiendish trap, possibly meeting with
a gruesome fate that would be forever shrouded
in blank mystery.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins, watching closely as he narrated
these uncomfortable facts, was pleased to see
that neither of his interested auditors displayed
the least sign of being disturbed, showing that
they had long since discounted everything along
this line.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c014'>CHAPTER IX <br /> <br />COACHING PERK</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Of course it was in keeping with this exchange
of confidences that Jack should relate all that
had happened to them since their arrival in
Atlanta to secure the ship awaiting them, load
it to capacity for a long voyage, and finally start
off from Candler Field.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins listened eagerly to this modest
account of what had already happened to them
as a starter in the hunt they had undertaken;
and he was visibly thrilled at hearing of the
bitter night chase, the desperate tactics undertaken
by the pair of human wolves aboard the
Ryan monoplane; and particularly when Jack
finally described in vivid language the astounding
act of Perk in first shattering the bothersome
searchlight, to follow this with his lucky
random shot that bore into the gas tank of the
pursuing craft and brought about an explosion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Possibly the urbane gentleman had never in
all his life listened to so ghastly a true story as
the graphic one thus modestly related by one
of the two participants; looking at them, with
Jack so calm and modest, giving all the credit
to his grinning accomplice, he must have decided
in his astute mind that at last Slippery
Slim was going to have a pair of human bloodhounds
on his trail such as all his ingenuity and
vindictiveness combined could not throw into
the discard.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me have,” he went on to say to Jack, “as
good a description as possible of those same
bills your friend Scotty found in that pocketbook
dropped among his clothing by the unknown
party whom you believe was looking for
your letter of instructions from Washington.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When Jack complied with this request the
other nodded his head approvingly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question but what they were of the same
stripe as all the others that have been brought to
our attention,” he told Jack. “You must know
it’s been a mooted question as to whether the
plates from which these notes are being printed
in vast quantities (that make it a gold mine for
the gang) are counterfeits engraved by some
master in the art or stolen property, which have
somehow never been missed by the plant where
much of the printing is done for the Treasury
Department—the bills are so perfect that cashiers
and tellers are all at sea over the facts, so
that something of a near panic has resulted in
banking circles as a result of this unknown quantity.
Remember these are the old type of banknotes,
and not the new abbreviated form of currency,
so that it is more difficult to discover the
actual facts.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will all come out in the wash, sir,” remarked
Perk, sagaciously, with a sly wink at
his pal.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, Perk,” observed the gentlemanly official,
smilingly; “but I’m more concerned about
your plan of campaign than anything else right
now. During the time you stop over here in
Orleans I mean to keep you posted with regard
to any fresh news that comes in to Headquarters
for there is hardly a day when we do not learn
of additional discoveries connected with this deluge
of phony money that’s been dumped on the
whole Southwest by this hard working gang.
I am telling you everything that’s known or suspected,
so that you can figure out your best line
of action.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We understand that, Mr. Adkins,” said Jack,
nodding, “and you can rest assured we appreciate
your kindness more than I can tell you.
Before we jump off you will know what we’ve
decided to do, so as to pick up a warm trail;
and after that, sir, don’t be worried if you fail
to hear a single word from us for days, weeks,
or even months; but depend upon it we’ll be
working on the job every minute.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And never forget, I beg of you, that this
man is a devil for cruelty and craftiness—I’m
sure you’ll not delude yourselves that his arrest
will be an easy task; for as good men as were
ever on the roll of our Secret Service Department
have fallen down on the job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you again, sir, for your warning; but
we’re not meaning to feel anything like over-confidence,
so as to let the bars down. I understand
from my having been picked to take up
this case, that the knowledge of myself and my
assistant here along the line of aviation cut a big
figure in the appointment, since it has been
learned that Slim himself makes use of a flying
boat possibly to cross over from the wilds of
Mexico, it being suspected he has his plant
hidden away somewhere among the mountains,
where he doubtless keeps peace with the authorities
by paying tribute that insures his being left
undisturbed. We hope to change all that sooner
or later, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I admire your modesty, Jack,” continued the
Government official, who had warmed toward
the pair during the short time he had known
them, and seemed to take a personal interest in
their fortunes. “Remember to keep in touch
with Headquarters while in the city, so as to
notify me in case you need any assistance—I can
later on place a posse of oldtime Texas Rangers
at your service, if the occasion arises for a necessity
to show force—they are now working for
the Government as border patrols, and as you
can understand, are the same rough-riding, fearless
type that played such a leading figure in
the early history of the Lone Star State; for we
have authority that covers such matters. And
I’ll be one of the first to extend you my hearty
congratulations should you win out, and bring
in your man; as I’ve no doubt your good pal
here used to do when, as you’ve told me, he used
to work with the Canadian Mounted Police
force, in years gone by.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It won’t be our fault, sir, if we make a flop
o’ the job,” asserted Perk, who believed he ought
to get in an occasional word; although there
were a good many things he did not wholly
understand, and which he would depend on
Jack to further explain when opportunity arose.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins shook them both cordially by the
hand, and took his departure, leaving them to
digest all the startling facts he had placed in
their possession. By slow degrees they would
figure things out, and sketch their plan of operation;
then would come the hour when once more
they must depend on their wings to carry them
many hundreds of miles toward the scene of
action, where the air would be surcharged with
dynamite, while deadly enemies might be lying
in ambush, ready to take them by surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk started to spring his questions, and Jack
was only too glad to make the necessary explanations;
for it was necessary that they work in
complete harmony if they hoped to be successful.</p>

<p class='c013'>As far as they had gone, things looked hopeful
to Jack, as he marshalled the facts that had
lately been placed in their possession. He was
satisfied that when every item had been arranged
in its rightful sequence they could fashion a
plan of campaign that would at least have a
better chance for winning out than any of those
utilized by former detectives, who had not possessed
the essential wings so as to meet Slippery
Slim on his own chosen ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No tellin’ just how long we’ll stick it out in
this burgh, I guess, buddy?” suggested Perk,
some time later, as they continued to take things
easy, resting up after a hard night’s flight, and
meaning to get around the city after noon and
lunch time had come and passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Couldn’t say as yet, Perk; we’ve got to comb
out the stuff as handed over by our new friend,
Mr. Adkins, and discard everything that doesn’t
pan out as being worth while. Then there were
a few leaders he dropped that, if followed up,
might turn out to be leading clues, the possession
of which would possibly turn the tide of battle.
I’m meaning not to let anything make me show
undue speed—Rome wasn’t built in a day, we’ve
got to recollect, and so shape things from the
standpoint of ‘safety first’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! that’s the boy!” gurgled the pleased
Perk; “me, don’t I remember that story o’ the
hare an’ the tortoise runnin’ a race, which the
turtle won ’cause he never even stopped to rest
up; while the rabbit, thinkin’ he could run loops
around such a plodder, lay down to take a nap,
overslept himself, and when he got to the goal
there was Old Leatherback awaitin’ to turn the
big laugh on him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk wound up with one of his rollicking
laughs; everything seemed to create merriment
in his soul just now, after that royal breakfast;
though perhaps he was running away ahead of
the dry facts, and counting his chickens before
they were hatched out of the shell. But Perk
was confident the sly fox of a Slim would find
himself snagged in the net one of these days,
and the clever guy who handled things would
turn out to be an aviator and sky detective named
Jack Ralston.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack some time afterwards, had just aroused
from a short nap, when Perk, who had been
pondering and grumbling to himself, tossed out
another question, as if to disclose what was
troubling him:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it, old hoss, do you b’lieve them
dicks we left behind after they’d floated down
from a high ceilin’ with their chutes, got outen
the scrape, so they could a hiked to some nearby
village or town, an’ took the first train headed
for Orleans, reckonin’ we must a’been on the
jump thisaways?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say the chances all point that way, Perk,”
Jack told him, without the slightest hesitation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jumpin’ crickets! if that’s a fact why, a feller
might run acrost the slick pair any old minute—meet
’em right face to face!” Perk went on to
say, as if the fact gave him more or less concern.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose then you’d recognize the chappies
with just one look, eh, what about that, partner?”
asked Jack, laughingly; at which the other
grinned a bit foolishly, to admit he had serious
doubts on that score.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! didn’t either o’ us get a peep-in at
their monikers, worse luck—had them helmets
and goggles in place right away, like they didn’t
mean to give us a single look-in. S’pose now
they got the high sign on us boys?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“On a venture I’d say that was always possible,”
replied Jack, soberly; for this very point
had occurred to him, and was as yet unsettled
in his mind. “Nobody knows how long they may
have been in Atlanta—Mr. Adkins assured us
Slim seemed to have all sorts of strings out, so
as to learn in advance of any bunch of Government
agents taking the field against his giant
bogus money monopoly; and for all we can tell
those two may have been spying on us most
of the time we were around Candler Field, getting
our ship ready to take to the air.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rotten luck, I’m sayin’, and too much one-sided
to suit me,” growled Perk, frowning savagely.
“Here we got to do our work in the
dark; while that smart cuss holds all the high
cards in the pack, an’ c’n trump our ace any
time he takes a notion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No need to worry about that, comrade,” said
Jack, soothingly. “You must remember that
when we move along we mean to disappear as
if heading into the thickest belt of pea soup fog
ever seen—in that way they’ll lose all trace of
us, and we can play our cards as we choose, making
up for a different breed of sky travelers, so
as to dope the cleverest kind of spies he can send
out. While they’re left guessing what’s become
of us we’ll be doing our little tracking job, and
hour by hour, day after day, keep on creeping
closer to their secret stronghold, wherever that
may prove to be. Those are some of the things
we figured on doing, Perk, don’t forget.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The one addressed made no reply, but as he
let his head fall back, as if he meant to pick up
a few winks of sleep, there came a look of rapt
admiration on his weather-beaten face that bespoke
the utmost confidence in his best pal.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c014'>CHAPTER X <br /> <br />LAYING PLANS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>After a noonday lunch Jack and his partner
spent most of the afternoon in carrying out the
various duties that were seemingly on their program.
Among other things Jack visited the
Federal building, and was closeted for more
than an hour with Mr. Adkins.</p>

<p class='c013'>The latter official had conceived a great fancy
for young Ralston, and went to no end of trouble
so as to post him with regard to what he was
likely to run up against while endeavoring to
close in on Slippery Slim. With his accustomed
sagacity Jack made notes of some of the
facts thus laid before him; but since these were
in shorthand, and would be utterly unintelligible
to any outside party, should they chance
to fall into enemy hands, there was no danger
that any mischief would follow.</p>

<p class='c013'>By degrees he was filling up with scraps of
description, and everything connected with
former attempts at locating the hideout, where
all this unlawful scrip was being turned off the
press, to flood the Southwest.</p>

<p class='c013'>That was always his way of doing—when
given a tough job Jack would live alongside it,
breathing the very atmosphere of the undertaking,
until he found himself sympathetic with the
aims and ambitions of the criminals whose apprehension
was placed on his shoulders by his
Big Boss.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll have dinner early, Perk,” he told the
other, who had been carrying out a number of
special duties while Jack was busy elsewhere,
“so as to retire to our room at the hotel. No
going out after nightfall for us just at present,
especially in a strange city, where some sneak
might waylay us coming back from the theater.
All that sort of pleasure must be put out of our
heads just at present.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! guess you’re hittin’ the nail on the
head, old hoss, when you say that,” grunted
Perk, who very probably had already picked out
just the screen play he wanted so badly to see;
but he was a good scout, and able to put duty
above pleasure, when the occasion arose for
making a personal sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another thing,” continued Jack, “there’s no
telling what night flying we’re bound to be up
against, in trying to keep our movements secret;
so it’d be wise for us both to enjoy all the extra
sleep that comes our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, partner,” assented Perk, subordinating
his desires to the slogan which he knew
was Jack’s watchword—“safety first”. “When
I’ve stowed away all the grub I c’n hold mebbe
I’ll be ready to hit the hay, to stick it out till
cock-crow around daylight—an’ then some.
Pretty fair sleeper, they always called me across
the big pond—crawl out as the last horn was
blowin’, rub my eyes a bit, get aboard my fightin’
crate, an’ step off to knock another Heine pilot
down afore botherin’ ’bout my breakfast—all in a
day’s doings with Gabe Perkiser. Sabbe that,
partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I know you like a book,” Jack told him
with a smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get a bellyfull when you had that confab
with Mr. Adkins?” demanded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m filled up to the brim with all kinds of
material, which by degrees I’ll have to sort out,
keeping only what strikes me as essential,” came
the answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see—sorter separatin’ the chaff from the
wheat,” mused Perk; “an’ if it’s a fair question,
old hoss, which way do we head when we take
off?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You might call it due northeast,” Jack told
him; and then, as his companion uttered a
startled exclamation, as though vastly surprised,
Jack gave a quick glance around as if to make
certain that no one was dogging their footsteps,
after which he lowered his voice almost to a
whisper, to add: “but that would be only for a
<i>blind</i>, in case hostile eyes were watching our
departure from the flying field; for after we’ve
cleared a dozen or more miles we can make a
complete circle, and point the nose of our boat
squarely west!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good boy!” snapped the relieved Perk;
“sounds a heap more like it. You sure did
throw a big scare into me, Jack, ’cause it’d been
’bout settled ’tween us that the game had ought
to be played out there in the boundless waste
spaces around the border.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, everything points that way so far,” he
was assured; “but no more talkie at present,
Perk—we’ll keep bottled up until inside four
walls, where no spy can steal our thunder.
Slim’s knocked the underpinning away from a
bunch of fine schemes looking to his undoing,
simply by finding out what the big game happened
to be, and then bursting the bubble by a
scoop. We don’t intend to dish our business
that way if it can be helped.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wall,” drawled Perk, with his best Yankee
effect, “guess not if we know our stuff, an’ c’n
roll our hoop.”</p>

<p class='c013'>As they walked along toward their hotel Perk
kept up a constant lookout, as though endeavoring
to make some more or less thrilling discovery—never
a man, black or white, did they meet
but that he was made the object of a severe
scrutiny by the suspicious one; however, they
reached their objective without his having run
across any reason for making a decision; and
shortly afterwards they were securely lodged in
their room, the door locked, and a couple of easy
chairs inviting them to take things comfortable,
which they lost no time in doing, being wearied
from so much trotting about—flying men as a
rule not enjoying a reputation for pedestrian
feats.</p>

<p class='c013'>A long and serious confab followed, both
speaking in low tones; Jack on his part explained
the mass of information he had accumulated,
and answered the flood of questions asked
by his comrade, as well as he was able; until he
found a chance to go deeper into things himself
he could not make definite statements concerning
a number of points that were a bit hazy, and
needed confirmation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus the afternoon waned, and the time came
when they were ready to think of the essential
“eats”. Of course it was Perk who brought this
subject up, for he chanced to have a tremendous
appetite, and was apt to give considerable time
to figuring what his next <i>menu</i> would be—indeed,
half the enjoyment in his estimation lay in
thus building air castles along the line of “grub”.</p>

<p class='c013'>Remembering that little episode up in Atlanta,
where some unknown party had made such
a “rat’s nest” of Scotty’s adjoining room, evidently
under a mistaken belief it belonged to
himself and Perk, Jack made sure to carry all
his important papers on his person, properly secured,
so that no deft hand of a sneak thief could
negotiate their abstraction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All ready, partner,” he told Perk, at the time
looking out of the window, holding back the
curtains to see the better who chanced to be
walking along the opposite pavement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never said sweeter words than them, old
boy; I sure was close to faintin’, my tummy
feelin’ like the bottom was adroppin’ out—soup
an’ such soft stuffs, while fillin’ at the time don’t
stay with me any great while—I crave solids
mostly. On your way then, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had marshalled all the facts that had
been placed in his possession, weeded a few out
as worthless, and by the time their discussion
ended had told his companion that the Finger
of Destiny was pointing out their future course
as lying over the almost boundless plains of
Texas, across New Mexico, and deep into Arizona
deserts, to the wild country along the border
not far distant from the spot at which the
Gila river forms a junction with the larger Colorado;
where the latter serves as a watery boundary
line between Arizona and Southeastern California,
with Old Mexico less than thirty miles
distant as the crow flies.</p>

<p class='c013'>It would be a big jump for them, but the flood
of bad currency undoubtedly had its start somewhere
in this hostile region, and spread out like
an open fan, northwest into San Diego and Los
Angeles—northward up to Salt Lake City—and
in the northeast as far as Oklahoma. To
effectually break it up it was necessary that they
go to the fountain head, so as to destroy the very
roots of the noisome poison ivy plant.</p>

<p class='c013'>They spent more than half an hour dining,
and needless to say Perk enjoyed himself to his
heart’s content—who wouldn’t if he had a pocketfull
of ready cash, furnished by a bountiful
Uncle Sam; a bill of fare bristling with all kinds
of tempting dishes such as Perk doted on; and
to complete the combination having been born
with a healthy, unbridled appetite?</p>

<p class='c013'>It was just commencing to get dusk when they
emerged from the restaurant and started back to
the hotel, some two blocks distant. Perk, as
usual, kept turning his head this way and that
very much like a wolf scalp-hunter looking for
his suspicious quarry. Presently he picked at
Jack’s sleeve, and bending his head until his lips
almost touched the other’s ear he observed in a
sibilant whisper!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen, partner—we got a clam doggin’ us
like a bloodhound on the track o’ a runaway nigger
from a convict camp back in Alabam—get
that, do you?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c014'>CHAPTER XI <br /> <br />THE NIGHT ALARM</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“I’m not thrilled by what you say, Perk, because
I’ve been more than half expecting to hear
that discovery. Glad you got on to him okay;
because it’s always best to know what’s in the
wind. What sort of a chap is he like?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack spoke in his usual calm way, and the other
realized he had undoubtedly been prepared for
the sudden news.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ out o’ the way ’bout his looks, far as
I c’n see,” was Perk’s reply; “on’y got a few
squints at the guy; but he’s keepin’ tab o’ our
movements I guess now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Reckon he might be one of those lads in the
Ryan ship that crashed in flames after they’d
flown the coop?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! just can’t be dead sure, partner,”
chuckled Perk; “but there’s somethin’ ’bout his
walk that gets me into believin’ he’s the <i>kiwi</i>
that pilot was keepin’ on our tail so long, stickin’
like a leech from a mud-hole.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder,” the other went on to say, as if
talking to himself; “if that’s the case then, both
those duffers pulled through with their lives, and
not so badly hurt. Honestly I’m a bit glad that’s
so, for up to the present I’ve never had occasion
to take a human life.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk snorted on hearing this.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if so be you’d been ten years older, my
boy, mebbe you’d not be able to say that—chances
are you’d a been mixed up in that mess across the
Atlantic, when Yanks an’ Johnny Rebs were
fightin’ shoulder to shoulder, and it was a case o’
a Heine pilot’s life or our’n. But if you keep
on with Uncle Sam’s service as you’re adoin’
right now, the time’ll come for you to fetch back
a dead man who jest <i>wouldn’t</i> let hisself be captured.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like as not,” remarked Jack; “but there’s no
need of crossing a river till you come to it; so
I’m not taking trouble by the forelock away
ahead of time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’ll we do ’bout this dickey bird that’s
bobbin’ at our heels so gaily, tell me, partner?”
pursued Perk, eagerly, as though in his fighting
heart he was actually hoping his superior would
give the order to turn on their persistent pursuer,
and at least blacken both his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! nothing at all, Perk; let him run his
rope; only we’ll keep along streets where there’s
plenty of company, and be prepared for any sort
of ambush; though I can’t believe he’d be crazy
enough to start anything so early in the evening—if
the hour was close to midnight, things
might be different. There are any number of
tough cases in this old Creole city ready to handle
a sticking game for the coin in it—blacks and
yellows and whites it doesn’t matter which—all
of them are assassins at heart.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then you don’t care if he shadows us straight
to the hotel?” demanded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Much good that will do him.” said Jack with
a light laugh; “the chances are two to one he
already knows where we’ve put up, and has had
some spy dog me to the Federal building. When
the time comes for us to jump off we’ll find a
slick way to hop our ship without giving these
boys a show-down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently they arrived at the hotel entrance,
without any untoward incident arising to mar
the quiet of the evening. Perk cast a parting
glance toward their rear just before entering,
and seeing the shadowy figure hovering not far
away, considered it a part of his duty to place
his thumb to his nose, and wiggle his fingers
derisively, at the same time uttering a snarl like
a bobcat at bay, to express his utter contempt.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once in their room, Jack first of all cast about
as if to decide whether any uninvited guest had
intruded on their preserves while they were absent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything seems to be just as we left it,”
he told his running mate, after making this little
survey, “and even if some busybody did get in
here with the aid of a pass-key borrowed from a
chambermaid, he was shrewd enough not to mess
things up like they did with our friend Scotty
of the air mail bunch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess now they must acome to the conclusion
you keep the letter o’ instructions ’bout your
person,” suggested Perk, wisely, “which, bein’
the case mebbe now they figger on sneakin’ in
here while we’re sound asleep, an’ agoin’ through
your clothes in regulation style. They do tell me
there be sneak thieves right clever in this same
burgh, equal to the ones out in India, where they
c’n steal the sheet from under a sleeper, without
wakin’ him up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I understand that’s really true, partner,” Jack
agreed; “but we’re not going to let them have
half a chance, even if they hired all the crooks
in New Orleans to play the game.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sounds good to me, boss,” Perk declared.
“We’ll manage to sleep with one eye open, an’
if any critter tries to give us the once over, he’ll
wish he’d never been born, that’s all I know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Before turning in, Jack placed a chair so nicely
balanced that in case of the door being ever so
slightly opened it would crash to the floor, making
enough noise to arouse the Seven Sleepers.
Perk grinned at seeing him prepare this “guardian
angel” as he termed it, and lost no time himself
in “hitting the hay.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Some time later in the night, when outside
noises had almost died away, there came a loud
clatter that awoke both the sleepers instantly.
They bounced out on the floor in their pajamas,
with Jack pulling the cord he had attached to
the electric bulb, so that the room was magically
illuminated.</p>

<p class='c013'>The chair lay on its side, and just beyond Perk
could see that their door was partly open; the
key had been left in the lock, but skillful fingers
must have manipulated it by means of
slender-jawed pliers, showing the touch of a professional
thief.</p>

<p class='c013'>Straight toward the door the form of Perk was
projected—a hungry lion could hardly have
made a more pronounced leap at some four-legged
game which he had been stalking.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tearing open the door still wider, Perk thrust
out his head, and looked up and down the hotel
corridor. He fancied he could make out a dim
figure far along the poorly lighted hall, but it
vanished like a phantom even as he stared, evidently
turning some corner.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there were other sounds arising—doors
all along the corridor were opening, and heads
being projected, showing how the startling alarm
had awakened numerous other sleepers, who
may have imagined an earthquake was in process
of occurring, though such a happening was utterly
foreign to the metropolis on the Lower Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c013'>Voices, too, were heard, from both masculine
as well as feminine sources, as the aroused hotel
guests endeavored to fathom the real meaning
of the row.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, seeing there was nothing doing, closed
the door, and locked it again; after which he
turned to his companion who had been watching
his actions with more or less amusement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Consarn his picture,” growled the old fighter;
“he got off scot free; I jest glimpsed him
aturnin’ the first bend down the hall. Blamed
shame I couldn’t come to grips with the yeller
cub—I’d a given a heap to twist his neck
some, you bet I would. Mebbe now I’d otter sit
up the rest o’ the night to make certain, eh,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not the slightest need of such a thing, partner,”
Jack assured him. “I’ll fix that door so it
won’t be opened again in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c013'>With that he again took the stout chair, and
placed it diagonally against the door, so that its
top rested just under the knob; after that had
been accomplished it must needs be a battering-ram
that could burst in on them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not content with that, Jack went to each of
the two windows, thrust out his head to examine
for the second time the face of the outer wall of
the building so as to make sure there was no
ledge wide enough to give a would-be trespasser
foothold.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not the ghost of a chance for the most nimble
thief to get in by way of a window, Perk, so
back to bed we go, and sleep like babes in the
wood for we’re in the third story and far enough
from a fire escape to be secure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk grinned and nodded acquiescence; truth
to tell he was not at all averse to starting all over
again—possibly the rude interruption had disturbed
him just when he was starting to partake
of a royal feast that covered every one of his most
beloved dishes and he was hugging the delusion
to his heart that if given another chance history
might repeat itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>At least there was no further alarm, and the
night passed into oblivion like all its countless
predecessors with the rising sun arousing the
two comrades, and Perk as usual singing out
that he felt as though he could easily manage two
customary breakfasts in that delighful restaurant
where they were already feeling so much at
home.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c014'>CHAPTER XII <br /> <br />PLAYING WITH FIRE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>During the morning Jack took a taxi and paid
another visit to the offices in the government
building where Mr. Adkins had his desk, doing
his daily stunt under the direction of the U. S.
District Attorney and other officials in the service
of Uncle Sam.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, also, had his job laid out for him, which
was to circulate around until he felt positive he
had thrown off any possible spy after which it
was his duty to make certain purchases, following
the list Jack had given him, have them all
sent to the aviation field in charge of the man
Mr. Adkins had placed on guard at the hangar
containing their ship and thus completing the
stock of supplies necessary for their long flight
and survey work.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk carried out his instructions to the letter,
and with great vim, since the fact of their laying
in these stores was a positive indication that
things were coming to pass insuring a speedy
getaway and <i>Action</i> was what had come to be
the greatest asset in life to Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>They met again at noon in their eating place,
where, choosing an isolated corner table they
could discuss their plan of campaign, even while
attending to the wants of the inner man.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk made his report, which the other seemed
to find good, judging from his frequent nods of
acquiescence and when the story had been told
to the last word, Perk felt it was his turn to
learn things.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess now you got the last batch o’ information
from His Nibs, Jack?” he hastened to
ask, expectantly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sure did, partner,” he was told. “A few
scraps of fresh news that’d be likely to interest
us had drifted in since I saw Mr. Adkins last,
which he passed along to me. I’ll sort these
shreds over later, and fix them where they belong.
So far as I can see now they corroborate
what we’ve already been so strongly believing
must be a fact.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which means, I guess, boss, we head west?”
ventured Perk, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Into the setting sun—that’s right, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do we still expect to keep in touch with Mr.
Adkins, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whenever the chance opens up, and we have
any important news to send along or want to
know certain things, perhaps even to call on him
for that bunch of old-time Texas Rangers he
said he could turn over to us if we found any
use for them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be!” said Perk, plainly excited, “I
sure do hope that emergency does bob up, ’cause
I’d give my last Mex dollar to glimpse them
rearin’, tearin’ ole fighters knockin’ spots outen
the bunch o ’lawless ringers Slippery Slim’s
gathered around him. Chances are they’d skip
out like hot fleas soon as they heard the ol’time
battle cry o’ the defenders o’ the Rio Grande in
the days when cattle rustlers raided the ranches
down Texas way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But we’ve got to remember,” cautioned
Jack, “that these chaps are like lean hungry
wolves, that never leave the trail of a wounded
stag as long as they can crawl along. I’m not
fancying we’ve pulled the wool over their eyes
so far and that fact was brought to my attention
just after I got back from conferring with
Mr. Adkins.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As how, boss?” queried the curious Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t just know what influenced me after
I’d entered the hotel, to step back and look out
again,” explained Jack. “There was the driver
of my taxi, the trusty who’d been recommended
by the clerk at the desk, talking earnestly with
an unknown party and even as I watched I saw
him thrust a bank note into the chauffeur’s itching
hand, showing that he has been corrupted
and is in cohoot with our enemies.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! is it so rotten bad as all that, partner?”
bleated the disgusted Perk, “All I c’n
say is I sure do hope it was a nice brand new five-dollar
bill he handed over to the yeller dog, an’
that it’s agoin’ to turn out to be a sample o’ their
bogus money outfit. Serve the slick renegade if
he got hisself pulled in for passin’ a counterfeit
note on some guy that ain’t goin’ to sit by and
take what’s comin’ to him without raisin’ a nice
howl.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t be too vindictive, Perk,” Jack told
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, partner, ever see the boob afore?” the
other demanded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you mean the chap who was pumping my
driver for all that was out, Perk, I can’t say
that I have. He was a flashily dressed man,
with loud clothes that would stamp him as a
gambler, like those who used to travel on these
Mississippi River steamboats in the old days before
the Civil War, fleecing unsuspecting passengers
out of all their money and I haven’t
the least doubt but what he’s a member of the
very gang we’re expecting to round up. Mr.
Adkins told me it was simply amazing the vastness
of the combine Slippery Slim’s managed to
gather around him but he was certain it must
number many scores of workers, all obeying the
orders of the mainspring—crooked Slim Garrabrant.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! the more you keep on tellin’ me them
big stories, Jack, the happier it all makes me
’cause I seem to just know there’s bound to be a
heap o’ rough house stuff croppin’ up, to cool
my blood, ragin’ hot just now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some fine day you’ll be rubbing up against
enough fighting to make you call quits with the
game. Perk, my boy; and it’s just likely to crop
up before long if indications count for anything.
I felt pretty sure from his swagger that
this fellow might be the very same master mind
in charge of that Ryan boat—then, too, when he
walked away he had a little limp, which might
have come from striking the ground so hard
after his chute let him down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Darned pity he didn’t break a leg, or even
his measly ol’ neck, I’d say,” grumbled Perk, one
of his fits of resentment gripping him just then.
“Got no use for these treacherous snakes that
squirm, and worm their way into the confidence
o’ honest gents, on’y to play a low-down trick,
an’ fill their pockets with smackers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s one thing we’ve got to guard
against,” suggested Jack, who seemed to have a
faculty for looking at every side of a picture,
and anticipating troubles that might never have
occurred to others less gifted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As what, partner?” asked Perk, brightening
up once more.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Delay is what they may be hoping for—some
way to hold us here while important news is
carried to headquarters. I can even see how
they might make some sort of ridiculous charge
against us to the police, in hopes we would be
held several days under suspicion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk looked astonished.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But see here, boss, we got our credentials
from Washington to prove we’re in the Secret
Service, an’ sky detectives at that; they jest
wouldn’t dare hold us on some sorter flimsy
charge ’cause that’d get ’em in hard with the
Government, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never know how these affairs may turn
out,” said Jack. “Often there seems to be some
kind of a jealous feeling between States officers
and those of the Government—almost like a little
vendetta, each arm of the Law striking out
at the other, and getting in a sly lick that’s good
for a laugh after hostilities have died down.
These Southern city police might make out
there was a grave charge of abduction or something
like that, compelling them to hold us <i>incommunicado</i>—that
is keep us from intercourse
with the U. S. District Attorney’s office until
several days had elapsed and then setting us
free with a lot of apologies that didn’t mean anything
whatsoever.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! I get your drift partner,” said Perk,
frowning. “We sure can’t afford to spend any
of our valuable time in the hoosgow here, if we
c’n help it. ’Cause things set that way I hope
you get busy an’ fix it so we’ll shake the dust o’
this same burgh off our shoes in a hurry. Got
the date settled yet, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shook hands with, and said goodbye to Mr.
Adkins this morning, Perk and you are at
liberty to figure that out as you please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it’s <i>tonight</i>?” asked the other, looking
well satisfied with such an enticing programme.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wind and weather permitting we’ll clear out
soon after twilight settles down on the city and
the river,” Jack assured his understudy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me, I’m sittin’ pretty, an’ taking things as
they come along, old hoss,” continued Perk.
“Let’s perambulate and attend to the crying
needs of this high noon hour—the girl told me
they expected to have apple dumplings for lunch
today an’ that’s one I’d nominate as bein’ among
my prime favorites—you know I got a <i>few</i> I
really enjoy an’ that’s no lie either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I know a good many on your list—fact
is,” said frank Jack, “if I ran down the whole
menu this noon there’d be only a scant few that’s
missed being called your especial favorites each
in its turn as the wind blew. But just as well
we did all the eating while the chance lasts, for
only a magician can tell what our bill of fare is
going to be during the coming week or two—some
weird dishes most likely—boiled owl,
fried rattlesnake, baked prairie dog—Heaven
knows to what ends we may be reduced.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have a heart, partner, don’t take my healthy
appetite away by mentionin’ them terrible
dishes. ’Member you promised we’d hire a taxi
after lunch, an’ drive all around the city, lampin’
the big sights like the French market, the queer
buryin’ places where holes in thick walls take
the place o’ graves, on ’count o’ there bein’ so
much water in the ground, with the city settin’
so low down, an’ the ol’ Mississippi on one o’
its benders. Then I want to eat Gulf oysters
an’ shrimp at one o’ them cute little stands we
noticed yesterday afternoon; try a reg’lar Creole
dinner tonight at that place Mr. Adkins told us
about—after which I’m all done with Orleans,
an’ ready to pull up stakes for keeps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll keep that to the last, Perk, and go to
the flying field from the eating house by taxi.
From that time on we’ll have to depend on our
own heads and hands to keep us out of difficulties.
But let’s hope we can climb up to a three
thousand foot ceiling, and strike out as if we
were aiming for Savannah or Jacksonville, only
to swing around inside of half an hour, climb
high over the city and river and put for the
Texas border at full speed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This enchanting program gave Perk much
cause for rejoicing and he sat down at their regular
table in the restaurant feeling, as he expressed
it, “happy as a clam at high tide” and
full of little laughs that seemed to gurgle up
from his shoes.</p>

<p class='c013'>They chatted of other happenings, not wishing
to “talk shop” in such a crowded place, lest
listening ears pick up certain information that
could be used greatly to their disadvantage—Perk
had an endless fund of interesting reminiscences
that, told in his inimitable fashion,
were a never failing source of joy to the appreciative
air pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was spent in motoring all
around the most interesting portions of the city,
the obliging Mr. Adkins having made out a list
of subjects they should not miss seeing while on
this first visit to the justly famous Louisiana metropolis.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIII <br /> <br />THE HOP-OFF</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Leaving the hotel, after settling their account,
and still making use of the taxi with its accommodating
driver, Jack and his comrade had
taken what small amount of hand luggage they
possessed along with them, not meaning to come
back again.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins had recommended a small but
unique restaurant run by a buxom French madame,
where they could have a Creole supper,
such as would long haunt their memories as a
genuine treat and it was to this place they ordered
their driver to convey them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both of them felt fairly convinced they had
been shadowed during the afternoon, although
so carefully must this have been accomplished
they had no positive proof to make it what Perk
would term a “dead certainty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They really did have a delightful “feed,” and
the dishes set before them were as a rule complete
mysteries although the obliging madame,
seeing they were tasting her triumphs of the
French <i>chef’s</i> art for the first time, gladly explained
the nature of the food they consumed
with so much gusto.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was fascinated with his supper, and inwardly
vowed that this should not be the last time
he would partake of tasty Creole dishes. This
duty fulfilled, they faced the next progressive
step in their night’s program—making for
the aviation field, and boarding their ship for
a speedy takeoff, their ultimate goal neither of
them could say just where, save that if all went
well they expected to be somewhere along the
California border within the next few days.</p>

<p class='c013'>The taxi was waiting, with the chauffeur on
the alert. He had already been advised of the
fact that they anticipated having some parties
attempt to spy upon them as evening settled
down and on this account he had maintained a
strict watch for troublesome visitors who might
even attempt to threaten him with bodily injury
unless he agreed to enter into their plans for
delaying the flight of the two flyers, as he knew
his passengers to be from what he had been told.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I see our taxi’s still on deck, partner,”
observed Perk, just as if he might have suspected
they would find it missing, with a detail of grim
city police waiting to escort them to the lockup,
they to be held in durance vile until serious
charges against them could be sifted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing came along to bother you, Henri?”
asked Jack of the smiling driver, who laughed
as he said in reply:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I haf seen one beeg hulk of ze man hanging
around, M’sieu, and looking as if he would like
to eat me up but me, I haf been an old soldier
in the Grand Army of France, and I think he did
not like the way I throw my chest out thees way,
and walk as eef I am on guard duty; he did not
address a single word to me, but just a little
while ago he disappear—I think he may haf
gone to get more courage out of ze glass.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good boy, Henri,” said the grinning Perk,
clapping a hand on the stalwart chauffeur’s
shoulder; “for myself I should not like to tackle
you when you have your fighting face all set.
Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So they were off, and heading out in the direction
of the aviation grounds, with the first shadows
of approaching evening gathering around
them. Perk may have been more or less nervous,
in anticipation of something coming to pass that
would seriously cripple their plans for a speedy
flight, since he kept turning his head from side
to side and scrutinizing every one they saw upon
the streets they traversed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Henri maintained a fairly good speed, all the
law would permit, so that few cars passed them
on the road. Perk managed to watch closely,
and never a motor came booming along in their
wake, honking to announce the driver’s intention
to pass by, than he had his eyes glued on the car
and continued to pay strict attention until it
had crept well up ahead.</p>

<p class='c013'>But after all nothing out of the way came to
pass, and eventually they reached the aviation
field where they found lights already in play,
since a delayed air mail ship was hovering over
signaling for better illumination. There was
some small damage in regard to the steering
gear, making it a bit risky to try a landing unless
the field was brilliantly lighted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You made an arrangement with a couple of
the ground force to hang around so as to help
us get the crate out okay, didn’t you, Perk?”
queried Jack, as they drew up close to the particular
hangar where they had seen their plane
placed in quarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, I sure did, Jack,” the other replied.
“Must be they’re over where that crate hanging
overhead means to land—somethin’ wrong mebbe
but they gimme their word to stay around
till we got here—there, I c’n lamp the guys
runnin’ thisaways right now, so it’s okay, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I see them coming,” returned the other,
himself a bit relieved, since the intended departure
was a most important episode in their plans,
and to meet with any sort of a setback would
be most aggravating indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The two mechanicians quickly arrived, the
hanger was unlocked and opened so as to permit
the exit of the ship. First of all both flyers
hastened to don their working togs, then fasten
on the ’chutes with the harness necessary for the
purpose, all working smoothly and finally clapping
their helmets on their heads, with the earflaps
secured to keep things in readiness for any
emergency that might crop up.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being accomplished, Jack gave the word
to have the heavy ship dragged out into the open.
He knew that his assistant would have looked
after everything essential to their comfort during
the coming flight for Perk was one of those
dependable fellows who carry out orders with
machine-like regularity.</p>

<p class='c013'>A few parties had hastened up to see what
was going on but so far as Perk could tell they
were either workers connected with the field, or
else visitors from the city, who had lingered to
watch the landing of the air mail, so as to tell
how it was done when they reached their several
homes, to partake of a late supper.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now the ship had been swung around so as
to head into the west, since the soft evening breeze
was coming from that quarter and everything
seemed in readiness for the take-off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, still surveying his surroundings as if
still cherishing a fragment of his former suspicions
that all might not be as lovely as surface
indications would announce, started to climb
aboard. Jack on his part was handing some
money to the two men, not wishing to leave a
single thing unpaid when passing out from New
Orleans—there was nothing to be done about
their use of the hangar, since Mr. Adkins had
assured him that matter had already been taken
care of, regardless of how long they chose to
linger in the Crescent City.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, too, cast a last glance around, just as he
would have done had he still been with the air
mail service and about to start off on his customary
night flight with the north-bound sacks
of letters and the express matter that vent along.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then he heard Perk give vent to a hurried
exclamation:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get aboard, partner; I guess the measly critters
are acomin’ down on us like hot cakes right
now. Lookit how they start arunnin’ thisaway,
will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did not bother looking, as every second
might be valuable; he climbed aboard with alacrity,
and settled down in his seat; at the same time
calling out to the helpers to stand aside. Then
he pulled the gun, with the motor responding
instantly, so well had Perk done his work when
checking up the ship that morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was still glueing his eyes on the several
figures now racing madly in their general direction,
and waving their arms wildly; no doubt
they had started to shout in addition, but the
descending air mail crate was making more or
less racket, which, added to by their own motor’s
thunder, prevented any one from hearing what
they may have been whooping.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was trembling with an excess of emotion—evidently
they had just escaped “by the
skin of their teeth,” for he felt certain he could
distinguish the uniforms of the police in the
little bunch of runners.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Played your hand just a mite too late, gents!”
Perk was whooping as he in turn waved a mocking
adieu backward; “thought you’d ketch a
weasel asleep, I guess, but not so easy, you gate
crashers. Wow! here we go spinnin’ along like
the wind, and it’s goodnight to the bunch. Huh!
shootin’ at us, air you—jest awastin’ ammunition,
that’s all, boys. Go ’way back an’ sit down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Jack lifted her in an upward fling, and
they were off like a startled hawk!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIV <br /> <br />SKIRTING THE GULF</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There was some shooting going on back there,
for although of course the watchful Perk failed
to catch the sound of discharges of guns, he did
see flash after flash, proclaiming that the police,
under the impression that important criminals
were beating them to it, wished to show
their warlike spirit by such a bombardment.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the flying missiles came anywhere near the
ascending plane that fact was not manifest to the
two occupants of the cockpit; their movements
must have been too speedy for such an attack to
be successful and almost immediately they had
risen beyond the danger line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was feeling vastly relieved, for it would
have been a bad beginning of their special mission
were they detained for days in the Southern
city, while the agents of the great counterfeit
league held the upper hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>He could see with the last glimpse he had of
the aviation field that all this lively accompaniment
to their take-off had created considerable
excitement—people were running back and
forth, like milling cattle when stampeded in a
furious thunder storm and Perk even fancied
there was some sort of a movement as though a
ship would be sent after them in pursuit.</p>

<p class='c013'>That troubled him not a bit, because already
they were leaving the field far in their wake, and
would really be lost in the gathering shadows of
coming night before any pursuit plane left the
ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides, had they not already had one experience
along those lines, and completely worsted
the persistent enemy, sending their boat down in
spirals of flames, with the two occupants forced
to “bail out” in order to save their lives?</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk put that possibility completely out of
his mind and busied himself with more practical
affairs. First of all he was desirous of communicating
with his comrade and to do this
they must have those indispensible head-phones
clapped to their ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was already applying his own pair with a
confidence inspired by frequent applications,
after which he managed to get Jack equipped
with the other pair.</p>

<p class='c013'>Steadily they continued to ascend, and swing
around until they faced the east, following the
plan Jack had outlined to his mate. Not too
high did the pilot urge his craft, since such a
course was apt to bring them in the sunlight
that still lingered along the upper air lanes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, they turned out to be a hot bunch all
right, partner,” was what Perk observed, when
he had the harness adjusted and the ear-phone
means of communication in shape for use.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You reckon they must have fetched the police
out with them, do you, Perk?” demanded the
one at the stick, as he kept an eye on his dials
spread across the black dashboard in front of the
cockpit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! just what they did, old hoss,” returned
the other, vehemently, but accompanying his remark
with a loud chuckle that told of secret
amusement, he being excessively fond of anything
that smacked of a joke; “an’ they kept up
a runnin’ fire at us, let me tell you—could see the
flashes spittin’ like fire crackers on the Fourth
o’ July.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All of which sounds like they must have told
a pretty wild and woolly yarn to the cops, to
make them want us as bad as that, eh, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Makes me think they got an idea this ain’t
goin’ to be just a ordinary man-hunt, but something
worth while; we should worry, Jack.
Mebbe they a’ready see the handwritin’ on the
wall, an’ mean to try an’ upset us in the start,
’fore we get agoin’ full tilt. Notice you’ve gone
an’ headed east, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It may fool them; but whether it does or not,
Perk, such a move’s our proper caper. When
we’ve gone something like ten or fifteen miles
we’ll get on the curve, swing around to the south,
and then when in sight of the gulf turn due west;
after that we’ll be on our way to the place where
our work is waiting for us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! had an idea you’d just climb till out
o’ sight, an’ then cross over the city and river—how
’bout it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too much risk to begin with,” came the ready
reply, showing how Jack always planned ahead;
“you know how a rushing boat can be heard
clearly even when lost to sight among the clouds.
It might be those same smart chaps, backed by
the authority of the police, would commandeer
a ship, and cruise around over the city, so as to
learn if we <i>did</i> come back so as to line out into
the heart of Texas; to make sure such a giveaway
of our plans can’t upset our calculations
we’ll cross the delta of the Mississippi close to
where it joins its muddy waters with the gulf.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you now, partner, an’ let me say I guess
that’s the safest game we c’n play. Time don’t
count anything wuth while with us on this trip
but results are what we crave.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it that time, boy, the Big Boss has
confidence in our being able to fetch home the
bacon, and we’re bound to prove he didn’t make
any mistake in putting us on the job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>All this time they continued to zoom along
like a frightened wild duck, and it was not long
before Jack was turning the nose of his ship
toward the south. The night had not as yet
settled down over the earth, although they were
holding an altitude of several thousand feet and
by straining his eyes a bit Perk was able to distinguish
objects far below—he could tell when
they passed over a large sheet of water, probably
Lake Ponchartrain, with narrower cuts winding
through vast marshes, and seas of waving reeds;
also begin to catch fugitive glimpses of the still
distant Mexican Gulf stretching away to the
mysterious south.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was all deeply interesting to Perk, always
on the lookout for fresh and novel scenes; for as
it happened, thus far in all his wanderings he
had really never looked upon that historical sheet
of salt water; although reading many a rattling
romance of the days when buccaneers and pirates
haunted the sub-tropical waters of that same
gulf, lying in wait for the Spanish galleons laden
with gold bars taken from the prodigally rich
mines of Mexico and Central America.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Perk’s mind those historical personages,
like Blackbeard, and his fellow rovers of the
Black Flag, lent a glamour to the great body of
water that was apt to thrill him through and
through whenever he allowed his gaze to fall
upon its restless surface, and dark secrets of the
past ages.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards their course was again
altered, with the ship swinging into the west. It
would seem to have been something like extreme
caution on Jack’s part but from all accounts, as
well as from their own experience with the desperate
gang that had given Uncle Sam so much
trouble, the scoundrels had a tremendous game
at stage, and were ready to go to any lengths to
protect the profitable conspiracy from being
smashed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Safety before speed” had always been Jack’s
slogan, which could be accounted one of the leading
reasons for the success that had come to him
in the various vocations he had followed—as a
county fair barn-stormer, then in the regular air
mail service, and now finally with the celebrated
Secret Service arm of the Government, entrusted
with one of the most abnormal duties ever given
out to its members.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not too dark for Perk to know when they
were passing over the several outlets to the
mighty river; indeed, he was even able to distinguish
an ocean going steamship heading up
toward the city of New Orleans; for its lights
were plainly in evidence and those who chanced
to be on deck could probably catch the throb of
their motor, since the air was unusually still,
allowing sounds to be heard at great distances,
especially when in the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then finally they left the water behind, and
found themselves passing over great stretches of
sugarcane, and bamboo thickets, with cabins of
the humble blacks in little hamlets, sometimes
villages of the lowlands, where, as Perk plainly
recollected, recent terrible floods had wrought
such damage.</p>

<p class='c013'>So the night wore on, and thus far nothing
had occurred to cause them the slightest worry.
If their cunning enemies suspected them of
planning to go west, and baiting the chief in his
lair, there was nothing as yet to show that they
were making arrangements to intercept the air
adventurers on their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>An hour—two of them passed, and still they
kept making rapid progress. The moon was long
above the eastern horizon, although occasionally
obscured by passing clouds but Perk told himself
it was a pretty fair night, all things considered,
and that he had “no kick coming.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c014'>CHAPTER XV <br /> <br />PERK AS A FIRE-FIGHTER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was not far from midnight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had insisted on taking over the controls,
so that Jack might secure a little rest, possibly
even pick up a few catnaps in addition. They
were at a low altitude, perhaps not more than a
thousand feet up, since the air was a bit cool
higher and it was certain they stood in no
danger from colliding with mountain peaks
while crossing the wide State of Texas, where
nothing save the level plains lay beneath.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was alive to his duties, but this did not
keep him from occasionally stretching his neck,
so as to look over the coaming of the cockpit,
and trying to make out objects that might be
dimly detected on the seemingly limitless plain
below.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a rule next to nothing worth while rewarded
these efforts and really he continued
doing his little stunt from sheer habit, but there
did come a time when he showed sudden interest,
and even half arose from his seat to stare
with increasing intensity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not only that but he immediately banked, to
start circling around a certain point. A minute
afterwards Perk reached out and shook Jack
gently by the shoulder. The ear-phones being
still affixed to their heads, Jack naturally desired
to know what was up, and did his pal wish to
give over the stick to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ doing, partner,” he was told with
emphasis; “but there’s somethin’ queer goin’ on
down yonder, and I’ve swung around so’s to give
it the once over. On your right, Jack, an’ there,
see how it sparks up again, will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say it looks like a fire,” ventured Jack,
after taking a good look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My idea to a fraction, boss!” snapped the
deeply interested Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like it might be breaking out through
the roof of some sort of cabin, or ranch house,”
further suggested Jack, himself now almost as
excited as his running mate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, boy!” declared Perk; “but somehow
I don’t lamp anybody kickin’ around in a
big fuss, ’cause o’ the shack bein’ ablaze; strikes
me either nobody ain’t to home or else they’re
so sound asleep they don’t know what’s goin’ on.
Glory be! if that’s the case, partner, they stand
a mighty good chance o’ bein’ burnt to death in
their beds. What ought we do ’bout it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“First place we’ve just got to rouse ’em up,
and the way to do that is to rush our engine to the
limit, so’s to make a big row—if that doesn’t
wake anybody it’ll only mean they’re away from
home—or else already smothered by the smoke.”
Perk accordingly started up such a racket that
the dreadful roaring noise seemed hoarse enough
to awaken the dead and all the while he kept
swinging around in a continuous circle.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, bending over the side, watched to see if
this had any effect, nor was his discovery long
delayed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That fetched them, Perk—I can see several
moving figures, and they seem to be rushing about
with pails in their hands. If the fire hasn’t got
too strong a start they may be able to throw
enough water to put it out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, couldn’t we do somethin’ more to help
the poor dicks?” cried Perk, ever ready and
willing to assist anybody in trouble, no matter
at what cost or personal risk to himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It mightn’t be a safe thing to attempt a blind
landing,” he was told; but something in Jack’s
voice or manner when he said this encouraged
Perk to go a bit further.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, chances are it’s as level as a barn floor
down there,” he hastened to say, eagerly; “here,
you could take the stick—there never was a better
hand at makin’ a three-point landin’ than
you, partner; me, I might drop a few flares down,
an’ that’d give us a squint o’ the ground. If we
kept to leeward o’ the fire there wouldn’t be any
risk from sparks, don’t you see, Jack? I never
yet had such a fat chance to be a fire-fighter;
let’s go, boy—they need all the help they c’n
get, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The temptation was so great it soon overpowered
Jack’s sense of caution; really he fancied
he would never forgive himself if he allowed
Perk to show a higher sense of duty to people
in distress than he himself could display.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, you win, Perk!” he quickly called
out; “hand over the stick, and get those flares
ready to drop when I give the word.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk started to make a move, showing that he
knew just where the objects of his desire were
located, for he did not have to leave his seat in
order to place his hand upon the small package
of flares.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile Jack had reduced their speed to
a minimum compatible with safety, still continuing
that circular movement. The fire had
by this time assumed sufficient proportions to
dispel any doubts they may have entertained regarding
its true nature, for it was burning at a
lively rate. Jack could see a crouching figure
sprawled on the roof, and apparently emptying
bucket after bucket of water on the greedy flames,
and passing the empties back down the nearby
ladder to some one standing on an upper rung.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was all mighty exciting, and to Jack seemed
like some sort of fetching picture as shown on
the silver screen at the movies—a scene developed
through the skill of a wizard director, aided
by a group of star actors, so as to bring out all
the realistic effects.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get ready, Perk!” he told the other suddenly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All set, partner,” came the inspiring response.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let her go, then!” called out the pilot, just
as he found himself over a point to leeward of the
burning ranch house that he figured would be
the best place to make a landing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had a flare falling almost as the last
words left the lips of the pilot and then both
of them used their eyes to advantage as it neared
the ground, lighting up a small section fairly
well—at least what he thus saw seemed to convince
Jack it would be fairly safe to attempt a
landing, for the ground looked smooth, and free
from outbuildings, corrals, or wire fences.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Drop another, quick as you can!” directed
Jack; then, as this was carried out he started
down, showing the die was cast, come what
would.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk threw a third flare to one side, in the
hope that its light would afford his pilot a chance
to effect one of his really marvelous landings;
which turned out to be sound reasoning on his
part—the shock when their landing gear came in
contact with the ground was not very severe, and
Jack managed so that they did not run more than
thirty feet toward the burning house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus far all was well.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was out of the cockpit like a flash, but
managed to hold his eager spirit in check long
enough to allow his comrade to join him. Then
they hurried over to the building, which they
could now see, thanks to both the moonlight and
the brilliance of the blaze, must be some kind of
a ranch house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Several men who had the appearance of cow
punchers were working for all they were worth,
fetching water from a well, and hurling it where
it was calculated to do the most good.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s give you a hand in that game, neighbors!”
Jack burst out with, as he joined the string,
backed by Perk, and commenced handling
buckets full and buckets empty, with as much
vim as though tested and tried members of a
village fire company.</p>

<p class='c013'>At such a time the addition of two more
willing workers can do considerable toward
smothering a fire, especially when there happens
to be no wind moving; and from the moment of
their arrival things began to take on a better
look as though up to then the fight had been
hovering “on the fence,” as Perk called it, and
the balance being overturned, victory was in
sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was in his glory, and the brisk way in
which he hurried those buckets along was worth
going a long way to witness; Jack never would
forget how proud he felt over the marvelous performance
of his running mate, and how those
encouraging cries, so constantly emitted by Perk,
seemed to enthuse everybody with fresh vim and
go.</p>

<p class='c013'>Finally the last spark was extinguished, and
the house saved, having suffered but scant damage.
Then the men, yes, and women too, gathered
around the pair of aviators who had come
on the scene just in the nick of time, to first of
all arouse the people of the prairie ranch to a
sense of the danger that hovered over their heads,
and finally take chances in effecting what might
have been a rough landing, so as to lend their
material aid to the fire fighters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Surely you will not think of starting off again
till break of day,” the big man with the white
head of hair, evidently the rancher himself, was
saying, while engaged in pumping the hands of
the two who had dropped down from the sky,
as it were, to bring warning of the burning roof,
and start the stiff fight against the greedy flames
that had ended so successfully. “Stay and eat
breakfast with us, strangers; we’d like to know
you both some better, and have a chance to thank
you most heartily.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unfortunately we must be on our way, neighbor,”
Jack told him. “It happens we are on
special duty, and delay might upset certain plans
we are bent on following out. It was just by
sheer accident we discovered the fire, and took
the customary means for attracting attention that
all air pilots employ; but some other day, if we
chance to be in this neighborhood, we’d be
pleased to see more of you all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The women added their voices to the pressing
invitation, but Jack was forced to decline, although
doing so smilingly, since he would have
liked very much to see more of these warm-hearted
stockmen and their wild riders, possibly
picking up some useful knowledge concerning
the way a ranch is run in these modern days, so
different from early times in the cattle country.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is absolutely necessary for us to be going,”
Jack told them all, “if we are lucky enough to
be able to hop-off again. Perk, I wish you’d
take a look over toward the west, and see if the
ground is fairly clear; while I talk for a few
more minutes with our new friends here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was astute enough to avoid giving their
names to any one but the ranchman, who readily
promised not to mention them to a living soul;
he felt heavily indebted to Jack and his chum,
and considered that they knew their business
best—for one thing he felt absolutely certain the
fact of their being in such a hurry had nothing
whatever to do with any unlawful act on their
part—he had as much confidence in them as
though Jack had actually confided the fact of
their being Government Secret Service agents,
bound on a mission fraught with much peril to
life and limb, the prime object of which was to
save honest people from being victimized by a
gang of unprincipled sharks, makers of clever
bank notes that were without the pale of the
law and only base counterfeits, although clever
imitations of the genuine bills.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVI <br /> <br />IN THE GRIP OF THE STORM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Perk soon afterwards showed up, and seemed
so cheerful that it was evident his little scouting
mission had yielded favorable results.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems okay to me, partner!” he burst out
with, as soon as she came along; “course it ain’t
just as smooth as some fields we know but there
ain’t goin’ to be any smart trouble takin’ off, I
guess now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And are we holding the nose of the ship
straight in line of the course you took a squint
at, Perk?” Jack asked, as he prepared to climb
into his seat, the people of the ranch clustering
around, to gaze with wide open eyes at the fleet
aircraft, some of them doubtless seeing such a
modern cloud clipper for the first time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dead ahead, boss, an’ you’ll strike the right
racket, I’m tellin’ you,” came the positive assurance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then jump aboard, comrade, and we’ll put
it to the test,” saying which Jack himself climbed
into the waiting cockpit, to settle down in his
accustomed seat, take a quick glance at his dials
when the small light was turned on, and await
a signal from the other sky traveler that he was
“fixed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The way was clear, and the fact that just then
the gay old moon condescended to poke her smiling
face out from behind a mass of clouds assisted
more or less in giving the pilot some of the
necessary illumination—the rest must be left to
his native sagacity and instinct.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a bunch of cottonwoods at some
little distance ahead, the location of which Perk
had pointed out to his mate before settling down
in his seat but if all went well Jack calculated
to be able to clear them in good shape—did it
seem necessary he could swerve slightly to the
right, and have a clear field for the take-off.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a little shouting as the friendly
plane started to taxi along, but of course this was
smothered by the increasing roar of exhaust and
spinning propeller. Faster and faster they scurried
onward, and then started to rise on an angle
just sufficient to nicely clear the tops of the cottonwoods;
when Jack jazzed his motor, to find
it running as “sweet as a purring cat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So they departed only a short time after making
that landing which humanity had demanded
and in times to come the little episode was
likely to afford both aviators more or less satisfaction,
in that they had “seen their duty and
done it,” as Perk would say in his whimsical
way.</p>

<p class='c013'>As they continued on their way Perk found
himself wondering if this interesting adventure
was destined to be a sample of other equally
thrilling happenings in store for them the further
they dipped into the great game that had been
laid at their door by the powers that be at Washington.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whenever he came to thinking of the audacity
shown by Slippery Slim in virtually defying all
the authority of the Government, Perk would
feel his dander rising as if in great indignation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh!” he at one time told himself, being
rather fond of thus communing, as his thoughts
ran on, “we’ll call <i>his</i> bluff just the same, the
scaly ol’ gila monster, you wait an’ see. Thinks
he’s the whole works, the boss man-handler, does
he, just ’cause he’s outguessed a number o’ the
boys. This time he’s due to find himself up
against guys o’ the right size, who’ll jerk him
down off’n his high perch in a jiffy, or I miss
my ticket.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk kept on boasting in his customary
fashion, possibly to keep his mind on the subject.
Jack was paying little attention to side issues
just then for he knew his pal’s peculiarities, and
short-comings as well and having “exhausted
his boiler” Perk presently lapsed into utter
silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had climbed to a fairly high ceiling, and
caught only occasional fugitive glimpses of the
earth far below, when the moon chanced to break
through the banks of clouds, which intervals
became less and less frequent, Jack noticed.</p>

<p class='c013'>He did not altogether fancy the looks of the
heavens, by degrees becoming more and more
overcast; still, this might after all mean next to
nothing and their business was to keep steadily
on their way as if things were bound to come out
all right.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was now drawing well on toward midnight,
and they had placed hundreds of miles between
the city of their recent stay and themselves. Long
since Perk had taken what proved to be his last
glimpse of the vast gulf as seen far away toward
the south, when the night was brightly illuminated,
with the moon’s silvery rays shining on the
glistening waters, and making a picture that
even appealed to Perk’s rugged nature—after
that all he was able to make out was the monotonous
level plains that lay in every quarter,
as though the whole earth consisted of this same
stock country.</p>

<p class='c013'>No longer were they able to find any cheer in
the company of the moon, for the canopy above,
earlier in the night peopled by a multitude of
bright stars, was now gripped in dense masses
of clouds.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having thus lost his guide marks below, Jack
was compelled to place all dependence upon his
faithful instruments, but this of course was an
old story to one of his experience, so that he did
not do any worrying on that score.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, buried in his own thoughts, and paying
scant heed to what changes were taking place
in the signs of the weather, had no warning until
suddenly there came a dazzling flash, that was
almost instantly succeeded by a tremendous burst
of thunder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ginger pop! that means we’re booked for a
bit o’ storm, mebbe, eh, Jack?” was his startled
exclamation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s hope it turns out to be <i>only</i> a bluster,”
the pilot went on to say, as he turned the nose of
his ship upward, and commenced to climb, evidently
in hopes that by so doing they might get
above those low hanging clouds, and have clear
sailing while the disturbance lasted.</p>

<p class='c013'>When shortly afterwards a second electrical
crash almost stunned them by its violence, Perk
began to fumble for his oilskin coat, which he
was never without when aboard a boat with an
open cockpit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk could take a ducking with as much good
nature as the next fellow but just the same he
did not intend to get soaked if he could help it,
since a continuance of the flight, with a cold wind
likely to follow the rain, would not prove to be
the most delightful experience possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>No sooner had he accomplished the job of
securing his raincoat than he gave Jack the well
known signal that he meant to take over the
stick, and thus allow his comrade to also protect
himself against bad weather.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly both of them were presently thus
equipped, and ready to take whatever might be
in the offing. Meanwhile the ascent was continued
in spasms, for there was always a chance
of getting above such a storm, and avoiding the
worst of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The thunder claps became more frequent, and
also much louder, so that each sudden burst gave
them both a thrill, death seemed so close, for
should their speeding ship chance to attract one
of those dazzling bolts it would be all over for
the daring air adventurers, and no one be the
wiser concerning their taking-off, until possibly
after long months had passed, their bleached
bones might be discovered by some party of
plainsmen out looking for rustlers or seeking to
round up missing stock.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus far not a single drop of rain had fallen,
according to Perk’s calculations but the coming
of the drenching flood could not be much longer
delayed, he felt positive. Had there not been
so much racket around them those keen ears of
his might have detected a rushing sound in the
near distance, like the roar of the incoming tide
on the sandy shores of the gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then it came with a swoop, the wind whistling
around their ears and the rain beating a tattoo
against the fuselage of the ship, as well as striking
them smartly in the face, despite such protection
as their helmets and heavy goggles afforded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack certainly had his hands full in managing
the bobbing, shifting craft, gripped by those
shifty gusts that came with giant force, making
the flyers feel as though they were clinging to a
mere chip tossed about in the wild fury of a
Texas tempest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Time and again did Perk feel as though his
heart had jumped up in his throat, almost choking
him; seasoned veteran at this sort of thing
as he believed himself to be, he could not help
this feeling of helplessness in the hands of the
aroused elements; yet each time Jack managed
to bring their ship through the teeth of the storm
in a way that was next door to miraculous, and
if Perk had up to this time not fully appreciated
the astonishing skill and confidence of his younger
companion while at the controls in an emergency,
he certainly was getting his lesson then and
there, in a way to cause it to sink deep, and stick.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch17' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVII <br /> <br />A FIGHT WELL WON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was no longer possible for the busy pilot to
keep on his course. Every minute of his time
was taken up with a desperate effort to keep
from being thrown into a nose dive, that, unless
miraculously conquered, would be likely to
send them whirling down, to crash from a five
thousand foot ceiling, and thus bring about a
complete writeoff.</p>

<p class='c013'>That however was the least of Jack’s worries—all
he asked was the ability and luck to be
able to fend off threatening disaster; could this
be done successfully in good time they could
pick up all that was lost, and once more continue
their westward flight.</p>

<p class='c013'>The battering they endured was simply tremendous,
and Jack marveled at the ship being
able to withstand such a horrible strain. If
but a single strut gave way under all that pounding
it would mean starting a series of similar
mishaps such as would quickly render them incapable
of keeping aloft; and with this threat
hanging over their heads it can readily be understood
neither of the two could be in a comfortable
frame of mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still it is wonderful how men thus threatened
will continue to carry on, although in an almost
mechanical fashion, doing just the necessary
thing with each change of pace on the part of
the tricky storm, and meeting successfully every
near tragedy as it arises to clutch them in its
grip.</p>

<p class='c013'>No longer did Jack keep on climbing—it
seemed to him that the further the staggering
boat lifted the more dangerous became their
situation for the air was surcharged with electricity
as the zigzag lightning darted from cloud
to cloud, doubling the chances of their frail
craft being struck.</p>

<p class='c013'>In fact it seemed so terrible above that he
lacked the nerve to persist in the upward work,
and even commenced to drop down. Perk
noticing this move, hardly knew what to make
of it. He was, as he himself would have expressed
it, “hanging on by his teeth,” in order
to keep his seat in the wildly plunging airship
and on finding that the bold pilot had given up
hope of finding relief in the upper regions, the
fact appalled him. Could it be Jack had decided
to attempt a landing, with only the glare
of those repeated electrical flashes to serve as
airport lights? That indeed would be next to
admitting their case as hopeless, and that Jack
was taking such desperate chances only as a last
resort.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were zooming along all this time as if
pursued by a jinx and indeed with such weird
accompaniments it would not be hard to believe
the spirit of the storm took on the part of such a
goblin of the air, to pursue relentlessly this bold
invader of the home of the aroused elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk hit the bullseye close to the center when
afterwards, in describing their experience on
this night of the great blow, he vowed they were
“playing dice with death,” since it seemed a bare
chance that they could ever pull through alive.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such is the life of the aviator—one hour sailing
smoothly along, at peace with all mankind,
envying no man his following, and feeling himself
to be on the top of the world—the next and
he may be fighting with might and main the
mad demons of the air, his life hanging in the
balance, his strength ebbing fast, and unless the
little cherub aloft that is said to be watching
over each sailor, whether of the sea or the limitless
air, comes to the rescue, his fate is sealed,
and another modern Argonaut never comes back
again to the home port.</p>

<p class='c013'>It did not seem to be any the less exciting even
when they had succeeded in gaining a much
lower altitude; although possibly the danger
from those thunderbolts might have been somewhat
abated. Perk soon realized that his pilot
had no intention of trying for a landing in the
midst of such a turmoil and confusion, which
fact relieved his harried feelings to some extent.
Indeed, it would have been a mad proceeding,
and almost unheard of, since hardly the slightest
chance offered for the most skillful pilot to
reach the earth without disaster, such as making
a ground loop, and having the heavy engine bury
them under its weight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk endeavored to convince himself that
things were a bit easier since a lower altitude
had been effected but in so doing he feared he
was only deceiving himself—if anything at all
things were even worse,—although the drop
might not be so far, which was small comfort,
since it must mean their complete annihilation
if it befell them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had numerous spasms when he fancied
something was going amiss with their staunch
craft, although unable to decide the exact nature
of the imaginary trouble. Despite all these
chills, which must have been the products of his
excitement, they managed to hold out minute
after minute, which fact gave more or less cause
for renewed hope.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack must indeed be almost completely exhausted,
and yet he refused to give up the controls,
to which his hands seemed glued as though
riveted there. Perk punched his side numbers
of times, but could get no favorable response,
proving that the other deemed it too hazardous
a proceeding to change possession of the stick
while in the whirl of that shrieking gale—which
was indeed only another adaptation of the old
proverb “it is folly to change horses when crossing
a stream.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no means for communication with
each other, even though they may have wished
to do so, since the ear-phones had been discarded
with the donning of their slickers, and
could not be put back in position, owing to the
sudden bursting of the storm, and the necessity
for employing their hands in more useful pursuits.</p>

<p class='c013'>All Perk could do was to hang on, keeping
himself ready to seize hold should his companion
be suddenly compelled to release his grip
through sheer weariness—that, and keeping tabs
of the weather, so as to glean the first favorable
sign that came along, promising a let-up, or at
least a break.</p>

<p class='c013'>Judging from the heavy rain that had come
down in such a solid stream it must be reckoned
one of those dreadful cloud-bursts of which he,
Perk, had so often heard, but which thus far in
his experience he had never met up with. No
doubt rivers would be out of their beds long before
dawn although that angle of the situation
did not interest them in the least, since their
traveling would not be interfered with a particle,
if only the air proved inviting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yes, soon Perk believed he could detect a lessening
of the baffling crosswinds that had been
so trying to the pilot, keeping him continually
on the anxious seat—then, too, it struck him the
floods were growing weaker in the bargain;
which two facts gave poor Perk a feeling akin to
joy in the region of his heart, such as he may
have known on previous occasions, but that must
have been far down in his adventurous past.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to their altimeter they were something
like two thousand feet from the ground,
but of course never the faintest glimpse could
they secure of what lay beneath them, so poor
was the visibility, with all that torrent of water
pouring down as might a mountain cataract.</p>

<p class='c013'>This delightful feeling grew stronger as minutes
passed—at this rate he would soon be able
to influence tired Jack to renounce his frozen
hold on the stick, and turn the handling of the
ship over to his chum.</p>

<p class='c013'>In this frame of mind he again nudged the
other, but in turn received a negative shake of
the head, which meant there was “nothing doing”—in
other words, since the storm still raged,
even though in somewhat diminished violence,
they must not be too premature, and spoil it all
just when the victory seemed about to drop into
their hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>With what Perk hoped would prove to be a
last dying spurt the rain came pelting down,
after which it suddenly stopped as though an
unseen hand away up among the clouds, had
plugged the gap, and kept any more water from
running out—enough was enough, surely, Perk
was telling himself when he made this thrilling
discovery and for one he felt he had had sufficient
rain to last him the balance of that year.</p>

<p class='c013'>So too did the wind start to diminish its force,
also coming from one direction with more constancy—some
relief to Jack, that was certain,
since now he could know just how to steer his
turbulent craft so as to meet the force driving
against it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then what did Perk do but start getting his
ear-phones adjusted, being wild to hear a human
voice, after all that fiendish roaring and howling
kicked up by the raging elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>Why, already the atmosphere had cleared
enough for him to catch faint glimpses of what
lay beneath them—it looked as though they had
come to a stretch of country where the level
prairie had changed into rougher ground, with
deep swales, sometimes running into quite respectable
ravines and there were indications of
ridges ahead, which might even prove to be
fairly high, so that it would have been tempting
Providence had Jack dropped still lower, while
flying blind through all that welter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Talk to me ’bout luck,” the grateful Perk
was saying to himself, “I never ran ’cross anything
like <i>this</i>—they told me Jack must a been
born under a lucky star, an’ now I sure b’lieves
it to be the right stuff they were givin’ me, an’
no taffy either. But that was some fight, take
it from me, fellers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards Jack condescended to give
him the sign that he was willing to pass up the
job; whereat Perk quickly superseded him as
pilot, and saw the other sink back in his cramped
quarters as though unable to hold up his tired
arms a second longer. Apparently the relief
had come not a minute too soon, for he must have
been close to the point of utter exhaustion after
so long and violent a strain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Battered as the crate had been while the gale
lashed them so madly, it had stood up under the
buffeting most amazingly and Perk would
never have occasion to utter anything saving
words of praise for the model and its makers;
it must be as near perfection as aircraft are being
built these days of man’s victory over the
savage forces of the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Setting his course in what he believed to be the
proper direction Perk waited until Jack seemed
fairly well recovered, when he was pleased to
see the other take up his head harness as though
he too felt the necessity for opening up communications
with his running mate, which outlook
gratified Perk immensely.</p>

<p class='c013'>There were many things he wished to have
made clear, and besides, he felt more than curious
to learn what Jack’s next move might turn
out to be—that they had drifted far from their
original course went without saying but a means
must be found to recover the lost ground, after
which they could take up the game again just
where the sudden storm had caused such a diversion.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then the moon peeped out through a
break in the clouds overhead, as though to tell
them it was all over, with decent weather once
more in the offing.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch18' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVIII <br /> <br />THE DESERTED SHACK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Well, that’s somehow I guess over, and I’m
mighty glad,” was the way Perk voiced his feelings,
when the clouds were rolling away, and the
heavenly host of stars backed up the moon in
lighting up the firmament.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Same here,” echoed Jack, still more or less
tired after his energetic battle with the unleashed
elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And strikes me the air’s got some chilly,”
added the other; “I own up I’m shivering to
beat the band right now. Where d’ye figger we
might be, partner—must a lost our course in all
that kettle o’ rain an’ wind, an’ drifted far to
the south, eh, what, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question about it, Perk; I could feel the
pull right along; still, there wasn’t a thing to do
but let the old crate take the reins in her teeth.
Once morning comes we’ll manage somehow to
get a line on our locality, and swing back to our
course.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some hours off yet,” ventured Perk, whose
lips were indeed trembling, as if the chill was
beginning to get in its work—perhaps all that
recent excitement was helping to make him
shiver, as it often will, even in the case of the
most valiant of men.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack noticed this fact, even though he himself
experienced nothing similar, for some reason or
other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Perk, you ought to have a chance
to sit alongside a warm fire and dry off; the rain
must have got under your slicker, and I reckon
now you’re slopping around in water back there.
Something’s <i>got</i> to be done about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! boss, don’t bother ’bout me; I’m a
hard-shell you must know, an’ a little dampness
ain’t agoin’ to do me any harm, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just the same we’ll try and make a landing,”
continued the other, “if there’s half a chance;
all I’d want would be to stack up against a level
stretch of upland, where the drainage had carried
off all that flood.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, that sounds all to the good, boy but
what difference will it make, I want to know?
After such a storm it’s bound to be some cold
even away down here along the Texas-Arizona
line; they call them Northers, jest like I’ve heard
they do down in Florida. Forget it, partner—I’m
a tough guy, an’ ain’t wantin’ to be coddled
like a baby.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just the same I say we’re going to land, if
half a chance shows up,” affirmed the pilot, in
that set way of his. “We’ll find the stuff to build
some sort of fire, Perk, where you could make
a pot of hot coffee; which’d do you more good
than a switch of hard liquor. Put that in your
pipe and smoke it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk remained silent for almost two whole
minutes, during which time no doubt he was
revolving in his mind what Jack had proposed—in
imagination he could almost <i>smell</i> the delicious
aroma of the coffee, boiling so merrily
over the red coals and even feel a joyous sensation
of warmth stealing through his chilled body.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Okay, Jack; you win, hands down. Me for
the coffee every time, to be followed by a quiet
smoke o’ my fav’rite brand o’ tobac. Have your
own way about it, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then get ready to try and make out what
sort of ground we’ll soon be passing over,” added
Jack, as he turned the ship earthward, and slid
down on a long glide, with the motor clamped
shut. “We’ll skim along close enough for you
to get a good idea as to how matters stand, and
yet giving enough distance to keep clear of any
clump of trees, or little bald knobs of rises.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently Perk assured him he could manage
to get fair glimpses at what lay below; at which
Jack again started on an even keel, moving with
as little speed as was compatible with safety.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not very long before the watcher gave
tongue.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Looks good to me down yonder, partner—guess
now we might make a safe an’ sane landin’—’specially
with <i>you</i> at the stick. Circulate
a little bit to the south, brother, ’cause it looks
some better thataways.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This Jack did, and then at another signal from
the observer, he proceeded to drop down with
almost as much confidence as he might have felt
when making a landing on Candler Field, well
lighted, and with every convenience suited to
safety and comfort.</p>

<p class='c013'>His confidence, it seemed, had not been misplaced,
for they effected a very fair contact, all
things considered, even though the landing was
somewhat “joggly and rough” as Perk expressed
it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once the ship came to a stop and both of them
hastened to clamber out of their close quarters—“cribbed,
cabined and confined,” Jack sometimes
liked to say in connection with their limited
cockpit, although his pal always reminded him
of the fact that <i>cabin</i> was something only conspicuous
by its absence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk’s first movement was to start threshing
his arms against his thighs with more or less
vigor, in which he showed good common sense
since there is no better method for stirring up
sluggish circulation after a long period of inaction.
Jack on his part commenced to check
up on certain sections of the undergear, meaning
to make certain he had done no damage in making
connection with the earth under such unfavorable
conditions.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything in ship-shape, I reckon, Perk,”
he announced. “And now let’s make out to find
something in the line of trees, where we might
pick up enough wood for that fire.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Looks kinder like things’d be mighty well
soaked after all that downpour,” affirmed the
shrewd Yankee-Canadian; “so it’d be a tough
job coaxin’ stuff to take fire. But wait a minute,
partner—I didn’t get a chance to tell you that I
spied what looked like an ol’ tumbledown shack
over to windward—I guess now it might be
abandoned, but just the same, partner, we’d be
apt to run across some dry wood inside.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suppose you step over and take a look-in,
Perk,” suggested the other. “I’ll stand by the
crate here, and keep our little glim working, so
you’ll get your bearings when you start back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, Jack,” acceded the lanky one,
always eager for any sort of service; “an’ by the
same token now I’ll tote my gun along—never
c’n tell what sorter game you’ll stack up against
on these here Texas plains, I’m told. I feel like
I could knock over a wolf er two, just to get my
blood to movin’ at a faster clip—how ’bout it,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suit yourself, Perk,” he was told, as Jack
climbed back into the cockpit so as to manipulate
the light he mentioned, and which would prove
sufficient to serve the wanderer as a beacon when
wishing to retrace his steps.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly Perk wandered off, having decided
as to the quarter where he had glimpsed
what looked like an old and lonely shack or
cabin, faintly seen in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>He came back in a short time, bubbling over
with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all right, Jack—just like I guessed, it
turned out to be an ownerless shack but the roof
looks like it might’ve shed the rain, an’ oh! boy!
heaps o’ dry wood inside, with a whoppin’ big
fireplace where you could slap on the biggest
log agoin’. Mebbe I ain’t glad you thought o’
this game. Come along, an’ we’ll fetch the stuff
for a warm snack—coffee, crackers, an’ bacon
in the bargain. Talk to me about luck, it’s comin’
to us in big chunks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! we’ve got to get used to that sort of
thing,” said Jack, in the most matter-of-fact tone
imaginable; “when you’re on such a wonderful
lay as this anything’s likely to happen, and all
kinds of surprises spring out at you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder,” was all Perk could say in reply;
but he lost no time in gathering together such
articles as aluminum coffeepot, skillet, cups, and
such other things as he knew would be needed to
complete their little midnight spread.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon it’s safe for us to leave our crate
off here,” remarked the cautious Jack, “but I’ll
fix things so no busybody can take-off while we’re
away,” which he did without any trouble; after
which they both set out to move along to the
deserted shack Perk had located, lying right
there, just as if a favoring Fate had designed it
for their especial benefit in an emergency, as
the grateful Perk told himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Arriving at the humble shack, that once may
have housed a happy family in days that were
gone, they made use of Jack’s electric torch in
order to gather some dry splinters of wood,
which, heaped above some paper on the open
hearth, soon blazed up, and afforded them an
opportunity to take a look around.</p>

<p class='c013'>Other fuel more lasting was hurriedly added
to the fire, and this done the two air adventurers
took stock of their surroundings. There was
nothing much to see, since the shack happened
to be entirely devoid of any kind of furniture,
even of the most primitive make; but the roof
had stood the ravages of time, and promised to
hold out for years still to come.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk held out his chilled hands to the blaze
but only for a few minutes; apparently the possibility
of brewing some “nectar” was an overpowering
temptation, for presently he started to
work.</p>

<p class='c013'>In short order he had the steam coming out
of the coffee pot spout, and a most delightful
odor permeated the interior of that ancient
shack. When the coffee was ready, Perk poured
some of the amber fluid in both aluminum cups,
and offered Jack one, together with a freshly
opened carton of tempting crackers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goes right to the spot,” the self-made <i>chef</i>
observed, rubbing a hand across his stomach, as
though experiencing the most blissful sensation
there; “best coffee I ever tasted, barrin’ none,
an’ say, I’ve tried it a good many places like
France and Germany, as well as in Turkey too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Same here,” Jack assured him, as he drained
his first cup. “By the way, didn’t you say you’d
fetched some bacon along over here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jest what I did, partner, an’ now I’ve had
my fust swaller o’ coffee I’ll get a move on an’
soon have some o’ the same asizzlin’ in the pan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He started to carry out his words, with the
interested Jack watching his efforts to try and
make the frying pan set evenly on the fire, a feat
that requires considerable knowledge of camp
tactics in order to be successful. After one near
spill, with Perk only saving an upset by quick
work, Jack modestly broke in to give a bit of
advice, not forgetting, however, that old saying
about “too many cooks spoil the broth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too hot to keep hold of the handle looks like,
partner; now if only we were outdoors we might
find stones enough to form some sort of foundation
on three sides of the fire, where you could
rest your pan. Hold on, here’s this old hearth
that was made of some kind of Mexican bricks—adobe
they call them and it looks to me like
some of ’em might be loose. Here, I’ll manage to
pry a few up for you, Perk, old man—just hold—your—horses
and——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did not finish his sentence, and the cook,
glancing up to see what ailed him, found his
pal holding the first adobe in an uplifted hand,
while he was himself staring hard into the cavity
from which it had come, as if he saw something
wonderfully fascinating there!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch19' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIX <br /> <br />FORTUNE KNOCKS AT THE DOOR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“I swan! what’s the matter, partner—my
sakes; is it a <i>rattler</i> you uncovered, I wanter
know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk on his part was already sharing the excitement
of his pal, although apparently from
an entirely different reason. He had already
started to scramble to his knees, being doubtless
bent on taking some aggressive action, when he
saw Jack reach forward and deliberately pluck
some object from the hole under the displaced
adobe fire brick, and hold it up to view.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he saw its nature Perk’s jaw dropped, and
he was the picture of abject astonishment—but
it was far from being any poisonous reptile that
Jack was thus exhibiting with such a grand
flourish; just as though he might be some necromancer
or magician, and drawing all manner of
amazing things out of an apparently empty
stove-pipe hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gosh-a-mighty! that looks like real money!
I swan!” burst from Perk’s lips, as he continued
to stare.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just what it’s supposed to be, Pal Perk,”
said Jack, trying to keep his own voice from
displaying a genuine tremolo—“a neat wad of
it, waiting here for us to drop in and pick it up.
Seems like things might be set up, like tenpins
in the alley, for two lucky dogs to knock down
with a couple of rolled balls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If that don’t beat anything I ever did see,”
continued the astounded Perk, now grinning, as
though the pleasant nature of their find was
commencing to appeal to him. “Jest think o’ a
pair o’ air tramps ahappenin’ along, runnin’
across this here deserted shack, an’ findin’ a fortune
askin’ to be taken care of—don’t it beat the
Dutch what c’n happen—Arabian Night’s adventures
can’t hold a candle to the real thing in
these modern days. Some ol’ miser musta hid
that boodle under the bricks, so’s to keep the
Mex raiders comin’ up over the international
border from gettin’ their itchin’ fingers on it—how
’bout that, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Off color, I’m afraid, Perk,” Jack told him,
after taking a quick look at his wonderful find
in the hearth <i>cache</i>; “that miser story might go
with some but it doesn’t wash with me worth
a red cent. In the first place if this money had
been hidden here by a miser, he’d have taken it
away with him when he cut stick. Then again
it would surely have been partly in hard cash,
like gold eagles, and such stuff—all hoards of
misers, you remember, are made up like that,
Perk, and when you give this the once-over
you’ll also notice how it’s all in bills, mostly
fresh ones at that, as if they hadn’t seen much
circulation, as you might say.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk drew in a long breath, and continued to
stare hard at the object Jack was holding out in
front of him; it might be that something in the
other’s words and manner suggested certain possibilities
that seemed almost too staggering for
poor Perk to digest offhand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gee whittiker jewsharps! Jack—what’s this
you’re hintin’ at, ol’ pal—give it to me easy-like,
so I c’n swaller it—all in bills—mostly
fresh ones at that—not seen much handlin’
around—say, are you tryin’ to tell me they’re
every one five dollar bills,—Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon that’s what they are, Perk, I’d say,
from taking a quick look at the same.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bad currency—counterfeits—bogus stuff, er—what?”
gasped the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look for yourself, and you’ll recognize them
as having been printed from the same plates as
the one we’re carrying with us as a sample of
Slippery Slim’s best work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Je-ru-salem crickets! I’m knocked silly for
a fact,” whimpered Perk; and then, as if mustering
up his vanishing stamina he went on to add:
“but however could they’ve got right there under
that brick—conjurer’s black magic, looks
like to me, partner, it sure does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nonsense! that part of it is easy enough to
figure out,” asserted Jack, as usual very matter-of-fact;
“the only thing that seems to border on
the miraculous is our running across this packet
of all the people in the Far West—it looks to
me as if some sort of Destiny might be handling
the cards—that all we have to do is to keep moving
and everything’s bound to come our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure does seem like a snap, and that’s a fact,”
agreed Perk, calming down a little as he began
to grow more accustomed to the great discovery
that had resulted from their deciding to drop
down, and have a sociable cup of hot coffee;
“but I’ll be danged if I c’n make head or tail
out o’ this happening—now, what under the sun
did anybody want to stick that wad o’ long green
under the same adobes, I’d like to know, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! there might be any number of answers
to that question, Perk; for instance didn’t we
learn that it was the habit of Slim, or one of his
busy bees, to jump across the border every little
while with a load of the flimsy, and dole the stuff
out to a number of agents he has working with
him in this section of the country, also all the
way over to Los Angeles and San Diego?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was the spiel they gave us, for a fact,
boss,” admitted Perk, wagging his head eagerly,
as though he felt certain clever Jack would be
able to figure things out, and hit on some sort of
explanation that would cover these mysterious
happenings.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, this, then, might be one of his hidden
<i>caches</i>—at certain times this unknown agent
hides some <i>real</i> money in such a hole as this, and
comes along another dark night it might be to
pick up the big wad that was left in exchange
for the small one he contributed. And that is
the way the game runs, so I was told.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“By gum! but what grand luck for us to come
in on this deal, Jack—pretty soft, I’d call it,
and neither of us had any hand in it either—just
hit on this little bank by sheer chance! Goin’
to crib the loot, are you, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack scratched his head as though certain
plans were flitting through it, and he must make
a choice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, we have to start somewhere, you understand,
Perk, and it looks like the finger of
Fate might be pointing right at this shack, and
telling us to get busy and pick up a strong clue
that, if followed up, would take us straight to
that hideout Slim’s got across in Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess I see what you mean now, brother,”
ventured Perk, his face lighting up with extreme
joy; for he felt they were already on the track,
and that from that hour there must be rapid
action continuously. “If so be that ’ere critter
that slams out these bills on greenhorns and
come-ons is gettin’ anxious to see what sorter
prize he’s drawn in the lottery, why, he might
jest come along any ol’ time now, since the
storm’s over an’ there’s nawthin’ to hold him up.
Got any idea he’s nigh due here, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shouldn’t be a bit surprised if he walked in
on us any time,” ventured Jack; and then, seeing
the puzzled look on his chum’s rugged face
he went on to add: “I didn’t mention the fact
but while we were making our way over from
the ship I felt certain I glimpsed several far-off
lights, as if they might be in windows of cabins
or houses of some sort. Then, too, I surely did
hear a big dog barking, and something like a
rooster crowing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I’ll be jiggered if you ain’t got sharper
ears than I c’n boast, Jack, ol’ hoss, which ain’t
no lie either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t you believe it, Perk; it just happened
that you were so wrapped up in thinking of that
coffee treat you didn’t pay as much attention to
outside things as I did. So it seems as if there
might be some kind of a village or prairie town
not more than two miles from this abandoned
old shack and if that’s so then the chances are
this agent who’s been working the public for
Slim probably lives there. Then again, like as
not he has a pretty good idea about when his
bunch of kale ought to be placed under that
brick—in fact he might have made his way out
here this very night only for the storm threatening.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, partner,” Perk hastened to say, brimful
of energy, “which, bein’ the case, it’s up to
us to lay a sweet little mantrap, so’s to trip him
by the heels if so be he knocks on our door.
How’ll we fetch it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“First of all we’ll finish our supper, and clean
up here,” came the ready explanation; “he may
smell the odor of coffee and bacon, but then you
might expect this shelter to be used once in a
while by Mexican tramps, or passing cowboys,
especially when a big storm threatens, so that
isn’t going to scare the Johnny. As for us, we’ll
fix things so as to give him a nice little surprise,
by hiding out, after making things all dark inside
here, with water thrown on the fire to
smother the hot coals, after which there’s nothing
to do but take things easy until he shows up—if
he does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sabbe, okay, partner; let’s get busy, for
the bacon’s done brown to a turn.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch20' class='c014'>CHAPTER XX <br /> <br />SPRINGING THE TRAP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There was much that must be done before they
could feel satisfied they had their mantrap arranged.
Jack realized that if the party who
played the part of local agent for the counterfeiter
gang had been kept from coming to secure
the fresh supply of bogus bills by the threatening
storm, he was likely to make his appearance
at almost any time, since all danger from the
electrical disturbance was now past.</p>

<p class='c013'>They finished their little supper without
wasting any more time, after which the matter
of hiding all traces of their presence was taken
up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See if you can find any water outdoors,
Perk,” Jack was saying, as he contemplated the
red embers of their late fire. “Seems to me I
stepped in some sort of a puddle while coming
up to the door. Here’s an old rusty can that
looks as if it’d hold a quantity—I want to dash
it on these coals so as to cool them off. That
done we’ll find some way to hide, and watch developments.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk sized up the situation cleverly enough,
and lost no time in setting about doing as his pal
suggested. When he came back he was carrying
the rusty can, which did leak a trifle, but
then that made no particular difference, so long
as enough water remained to put the fire out.</p>

<p class='c013'>It sizzled, and steamed a bit but Perk distributed
the fluid contents of his can with such
discretion that all this was speedily brought to
a finish, with the last red ember cooled off, leaving
a dead little pile of wood ashes as the only
reminder of their blaze.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now that’s settled, partner,” said the always
ready Perk, “what comes next on our program?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had his hand electric torch in use, for
otherwise they must have been left to grope
around, since the clouds continued to drift past
in clusters, shutting out most of the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We must gather up everything here that
might give us away, for like as not the fellow’ll
fetch some kind of a light along with him—lantern
it may turn out to be, because he knows its
apt to be pretty dark inside the old shack, and
he can’t do much just by fumbling around.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! that’s right, boss,” returned Perk,
commencing to gather up any and all their
scanty belongings, not forgetting that convenient
rifle of his. “But I say, how ’bout the bus—won’t
he lamp the thing settin’ there in the open
an’ ain’t it apt to give him a bad start?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had duly considered that very point in
making up his plans, and was ready to meet the
situation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Taken it all in all, buddy, there’s small danger
of that happening,” he went on to tell Perk.
“First, remember, the ship lies on that side of
the shack away from the spot where I glimpsed
those lights and if he comes along in a direct
line from the town there isn’t one chance in three
of him noticing it. Even if he does I reckon
he’ll feel dead certain only his own messenger’d
be flying in this region—he may never have seen
another crate besides the one sent out by Slippery
Slim.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She sounds good to me, Jack an’ I’m willin’
to take a shy at the target, if so be you guess it’s
straight goods, all wool’n a yard wide. Let’s
go!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly both passed out of the deserted
shack that had proved such a fortunate harbor
for them after the late storm. Jack knew what
they must do in following up the little plan he
had framed, with a view of giving the suspect
the shock of his life and without any further
preliminaries he set about carrying out the few
details.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a chink or two in this further wall,”
he went on to say, in a low voice, next door to a
whisper, “that will furnish us means for keeping
tabs on what’s going on inside. We’ll settle down
there, and just wait. As luck has it that side of
the shack is away from the moon, which is all in
our favor, in fact everything seems to be arranged
just to suit our plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bully set-up, boss, couldn’t be better for a
fact,” agreed the hopeful Perk, who firmly believed
in the element of Luck, and was immensely
gratified to discover how that little god
was working over-time in their favor—according
to his way of thinking it was always “better
to be born lucky than rich.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it?” whispered Jack, after they
had commenced to crouch down in the darkened
spot he had selected.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just great, that’s all,” Perk assured him,
“show me where one o’ them cracks c’n be located,
partner, an’ then I’ll be okay—all
fixed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack obliged by directing his chum’s hand to
an opening, through which it would be easy
enough to keep watch over any happening inside
the shack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Next we’ll creep over to this further corner,
and try to find out when he comes along,”
continued Jack. “From now on, Perk, keep
your tongue between your teeth—no talking, remember,
but if it does seem to be absolutely
necessary, put your lips close to my ear, and
whisper—get that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nuff sed, boss, I’m on,” came faintly from
the figure crouching at Jack’s side, after which
abject silence fell upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>A little later on Perk, now that his hearing
was strained so as to pick up any kind of sound,
however slight, caught the barking of a watchdog;
it seemed to be at a considerable distance
from the shack, and he judged there might be a
couple of miles lying between. This was not a
great amount of ground to cover, if only the inducement
were sufficiently urgent and that fat
packet of enticing bank bills, supposed to be
secreted under the adobes of the old hearth, must
represent an alluring prize, capable of drawing
a chap who was fond of “easy money” out of his
snug home at this unseasonable hour of the
night, and indulging in a little hike, for which
effort he would fancy himself well repaid.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some time passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>They lay there just back of the comer of the
dilapidated and abandoned shack, waiting, listening,
and frequently feeling a little thrill when
some soft sound came stealing to their ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Perk plainly heard what was surely a
low cough, such as might be caused by a sudden
tickling in the throat. Some one was undoubtedly
approaching the spot, and coming from the
west, where they understood the prairie hamlet,
or village, lay at the foot of a small ridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>He merely touched his companion’s right arm
to let Jack know something was in the wind.
The cough was repeated, so that Perk chuckled
softly to himself, as if more than ever convinced
that luck was bent on handing them out further
fat plums.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was already creeping back so as to reach
the spot where those convenient peepholes could
be found and of course Perk imitated his example.
Thus it came about they were in complete
readiness to make good use of their eyes
when a slight scratching sound came from
within, and a tiny flash announced that the newcomer
had struck a match.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk could see him there down on his knees,
and intent on applying his lighted match to the
wick of a lantern he had evidently fetched along
for this very purpose. If Perk could have analyzed
the feeling that possessed him just then he
must have compared it to the exultation of a cat
when about to make a jump upon a sparrow,
close up to which he had managed to hide, all
prepared for the finishing act of the ambush.</p>

<p class='c013'>No sooner had the man succeeded in lighting
his lantern than with eager hands he commenced
lifting the adobe under which Jack had again
artfully placed the bait in the shape of that
tempting packet of bogus notes.</p>

<p class='c013'>How eagerly he pounced on the contents of
his queer <i>cache</i>, all the avariciousness of a miser
handling his hoard was displayed and at the
same time he looked hurriedly from one side to
the other, as though his guilty soul, conscious of
having thus broken the law of his country, was
already seeing the long arm of Justice stretching
out menacingly toward him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack evidently had seen enough to satisfy him
the genuine criminal was in focus, and that there
could be no miscarriage of Justice in effecting
his capture with the goods upon him. He was
creeping toward the open door of the shack, evidently
bent on taking the slick partner of the
counterfeiter chief by surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk lost no time in crawling at his pal’s heels,
bent on having a hand in the closing scene of the
little drama—he wanted to see with his own
eyes just how such a slimy beast would take his
“bump” when he found the meshes of the net
closing around him.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon looking in at the open door.
The man still knelt there on the hard earthen
floor of the shack, and appeared to be nervously
fumbling the sheaf of bills, as though trying to
count them, and be assured that he had received
the full amount to which he was entitled—that
there had been no “holdout” attempted.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps one of them happened to make a
slight sound—either that, or else the man’s guilty
soul caused him to fancy he heard something
for he turned his head. It chanced that the
light of the lantern fell full upon his dark face,
and disclosed the distended eyes filled with terror,
as well as the expression so ghastly that
passed athwart his countenance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put ’em up!” commanded Jack, sharply, in
a voice that would brook no nonsense and as if
mechanically influenced to obey, the wretched
trapped distributor of bad notes raised both
hands, the packet falling to the floor as if his
nerveless fingers could no longer retain their
grip.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and Perk stepped blithely into the
lighted shack, the former with his ready automatic
covering the badly shaken rogue, Perk
trailing his rifle in a suggestive way, as if able
to back his boss up on the slightest provocation.</p>

<p class='c013'>First frisking the other, and removing a gun
from his back pocket, Jack made a motion with
his hand as he set Perk to work.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get the bracelets on him, partner, then we’ll
ask him a few leading questions before we make
up our minds what the next step’ll be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But—hold on, Mister,” whined the poor
devil, all aquiver as he groveled there on his
knees; “I ain’t done nawthin’—this hear ain’t
my stuff—I jest suspicioned Jud he must a had
somethin’ hid out this way, ’case he kep’ comin’
an’ agoin’, so I kim tuh see what it mout be. Now
I knows he must a robbed thet bank over in
Tucson when he went off with a gang he runs
with.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stow that gab,” said the disgusted Perk,
“that’s all too flimsy to wash. We got you to
rights an’ where the hair’s short, an’ you’ll have
a chanct to see what the inside o’ the pen at Atlanta’s
like. This here’s counterfeit long-green,
an’ you knows it, mister,” with which cutting
remark he snapped a pair of steel handcuffs
upon the other’s wrists with the skill only one
accustomed to handling such “safety-first” contraptions
could display, proving that for one of
Slippery Slim’s active lieutenants the show was
indeed over.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch21' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXI <br /> <br />PICKING UP CLUES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>By this time the man whom Uncle Sam’s two
clever sky detectives had trapped, showed signs
of being almost in a state of collapse. Too late
did he realize what a terrible mistake he had
made when yielding to the blandishments of
Slippery Slim Garrabrant, and acting under the
belief that he could defy the law and get away
with it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the big idea, partner,” Perk was asking
after he and Jack had fixed things so there
was no possible chance for their prisoner to
break away, and give them the laugh. “Do we
jump off right now, or wait till mornin’, I’d like
to know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No hurry at all,” was the calm reply, “I
want to go over our crate once more before we
start that hop across to the California border,
I’ve good reason to believe things are okay but
a second overhauling will satisfy me better.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I kinder guess you won’t want me to slip
over to this here town, an’ pick up a few fresh
eggs, eh, boss?” and Perk’s voice actually took
on a wheedling vein as he made this remark
for if there was anything he dearly loved along
the line of “eats” it was those same “fresh eggs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack shook his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hardly think it would be wise,” he observed;
“we don’t know the lay of the land for one thing—it
might be this party has some backing among
his neighbors, and we’d find ourselves in a hornets’
nest before we knew what was what. No,
we can stick it out here the balance of the night,
which is pretty well gone right now, and be off
about sunrise.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a lot more stuff around in here that’d
burn right well,” insinuated Perk; “how ’bout
another bit o’ fire—this night air feels some cool
to me an’ ’sides, we’d have a blaze ready so’s to
boil more coffee ’fore we kick off, eh, what,
partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Please yourself so far as that goes, Perk, I
reckon it wouldn’t feel at all bad to have some
fire, as we must hang out here several hours.
But don’t make any noise if you can help it.
Besides, we ought to keep an eye out for trouble,
no telling what this slick chap might work off
on us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! we’ll one o’ us keep watch off’n on,”
promised Perk, starting without any further delay
to gather some fuel, and get a blaze going.</p>

<p class='c013'>While he was thus engaged Jack took their
prisoner in hand, and commenced to grill him.
There was nothing of the dreaded “third degree”
rough-house measures in what Jack attempted
but he tried to show the man where his best interests
lay.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re in a bad fix, my friend,” Jack told
him: “and unless you come clean, so as to help
us round up the balance of your outfit, you’ll
be certain to get the full penalty the law lays
down. We know a whole lot about Slippery
Slim and his ways, and are dead certain we’re
bound to end up his graft before many more
days pass by. So when you’re answering my
questions don’t try to lie to me, for like as not
I’ll be already acquainted with the facts and
know you’re trying to beat around the bush.
Dangerous business, let me tell you; far better
for you to hold your tongue than deceive me.
Come clean, and I promise you I’ll do everything
in my power to have you let off easy, besides no
one need know you’ve turned State’s evidence.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he started in to put pointed questions,
concerning certain points that were vital to his
plans. Once he caught the man squirming under
the lash, and giving an answer that he very well
knew was like “beating around the bush.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know better than that, my friend,” he
told him sharply, “that’s only half a truth you’ve
given me. Don’t try it again if you know what’s
good for your health, or it’ll be a matter of possibly
ten years before you see your family again.
Stick to the truth, and it may be only a question
of six months you’ll spend at Atlanta behind the
bars. Now tell me again what I wanted to know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He had managed to impress his strong personality
upon the writhing wretch, who was
ready to throw himself unreservedly upon his
mercy and so the answers were given without
hesitation, although in some instances the man
declared he did not know, as he had only once
been across the line and visited Slippery Slim
in his hideout among the Mexican mountains.</p>

<p class='c013'>When Jack realized that he had really pumped
the other dry, he felt he had profited in many
ways and that their sudden determination to
make, a night landing, so as to recover after their
buffeting by the storm, had been a most fortunate
happening indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>For one thing he had learned that the name
of their frightened prisoner was Simeon Hawkins,
and that he had a wife and several children
living in the little prairie town only a few miles
distant—a fact that seemed to give him great
distress, now he found his avaricious dreams
wrecked, and himself in the hands of a couple
of those very same Secret Service detectives
whom the “big boss” had undoubtedly referred
to so contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had been “listening in,” and chuckling
happily whenever he realized his mate had made
some sort of a “ten-strike,” picking up valuable
information that was destined to ultimately
serve their ends wonderfully, and help to “pot
their game.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They sat there for some time, talking in low
tones. The man who lay close by helpless was
silent as a rule, although several times he uttered
a dismal groan, when his feelings overpowered
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess I’ll step out, partner,” remarked Perk
at one time, “an’ slip over to the ship, I’d sure
hate to have some critter do us a bad turn by
meddlin’ with any o’ them dials an’ gadgets.
What I wouldn’t do to <i>him</i> would be a caution,
that’s right.”</p>

<p class='c013'>From the fact that Perk carried his rifle along
with him his meaning was not difficult to understand
and Jack felt sorry for the chap who was
at the other end of the gun sights when his pal
pulled the trigger.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk cautiously approached the grounded
ship, and started when discovering some moving
object just in its shadow. The moon was shining
brightly now, so that it was an easy matter to see
for quite some little distance, although so deceptive
was the light that even sharp-eyed Perk
could hardly have told whether some dark object
seen fifty feet off was a stump or a black dog
sitting there and watching him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Waiting until the object moved again, he discovered
he had been wise to hold his fire, for by
then he had made it out to be some species of
animal. He took several forward steps, whereupon
the beast started to move off, uttering a
little nasty snarl while doing so.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks, on’y a stinkin’ kiote after all, skulkin’
’round to see if he c’n stir up a little grub o’ any
kind. Get out, you varmint!” and he waved his
gun above his head while starting to run forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>This completely demoralized the cowardly
prairie marauder, so that he took to his heels,
and quickly vanished in the near distance. Perk
found everything all right when he gave the
stranded plane “the once over”; and being satisfied
that there was nothing to be feared from a
coyote prowling around in search of a supper or
breakfast, he returned to the shack to report all
well.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was busily engaged making certain notes,
and reading others connected with their present
business, as jotted down in his memorandum
book in a peculiar brand of short-hand all his
own, but which would appear as so much Greek
or Choctaw to any one else.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Better turn in, and get a few winks of sleep,
brother,” he told Perk, who had yawned once or
twice as he sat before the fire. “I’ll wake you up
in about an hour or so when you can take your
turn playing sentinel, until the dawn shows up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just as you say, old hoss,” came the ready
reply; “fact is, I’m a bit drowsy, an’ could get
away with a few winks; but don’t forget to wake
me when the hour’s up, remember.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s all right, partner,” Jack told him,
laughingly; “we’re in this game thirty-thirty,
and you’ll have your turn, depend on it. Now
get busy, and don’t you dare snore above a whisper
either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I do jest gimme a poke, Jack—tryin’ to
break myself o’ that nasty habit but I got to
have help, you know—no feller ain’t wholly responsible
fur what he does when he’s asleep.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In due time Jack aroused the other, and himself
sought a brief period of forgetfulness in
sleep. So the balance of the night passed, and
morning came with a clear sky, and a promise of
decent weather for the continuance of their
flight.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch22' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXII <br /> <br />OVER ARIZONA DESERTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Perk must have dreamed about that hot coffee
treat he had been promising himself, for when
Jack opened his eyes he found his comrade already
watching the bubbling pot, from which
delightful odors were commencing to escape in
the way of steam.</p>

<p class='c013'>They enjoyed quite a decent little breakfast,
what with the ambrosia contained in their aluminum
cups together with some crackers and jam,
after the crisp bacon had been disposed of. Jack
offered some to their prisoner, but the man sadly
shook his head, as if to say he had no appetite
whatever.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was not a bad looking fellow, only with a
weak sort of chin, and evidently built along a
line that could be easily tempted to go wrong if
the inducement were only gilded enough. Jack
felt sorry for him, especially since he had learned
about his family; and was determined to do what
he could so as to get Simeon off, should his information
prove of any value to their cause.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once breakfast was disposed of they all went
over to where the ship lay. By this time Simeon
had found that they really planned to carry him
off with them, a startling fact that added to his
alarm, for apparently he had never been up in
a plane, and a species of stage-fright made him
shake as if he had the ague.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there was no other way to work things,
for should they set him free the chances were
the man, forgetting his promise, would try to
send out some kind of warning to Slippery Slim,
and in the end he and Perk were apt to pay dearly
for their slip-up, perhaps even with their own
lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>When playing such a desperate game with so
canny a lawbreaker it would be the height of
folly to let the dictates of tender hearts turn
them from the path of “safety first,” and Simeon
must continue to “take his medicine,” even
though the innocent ones at home suffered for
his misdeeds—he had never considered others
whom his evil actions had doubtless harmed,
when they found themselves arrested for passing
worthless bills, and how could he expect these
sworn officers of the law to go easy with him
when caught in the act?</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk now began to wonder just how they
would be able to “tote” a third party in the limited
accommodations afforded by the double
cockpit of their ship. It was bound to prove a
tight squeeze, and not so comfortable but then
why grumble on account of a trifle like that,
when Fortune was giving them such a glad hand
all the while?</p>

<p class='c013'>He began to shift things around some while
Jack was busy checking the motor, struts, undergear,
and propeller, with the design of condensing,
and making more room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Funny how you c’n jam things into such a
small compass when you really an’ truly try,”
he told Jack, when he had finished his task. “I
kinder guess I’ll be able to fix him okay, ’cause
he’s no great shakes at size, an’, seems like to
me, he’s shrinkin’ right afore my eyes, he’s that
shaky. Then it’s only for the day, I figger; how
’bout that, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve planned all that out, partner,” he was
told. “As soon as we get over to the California
border we’ll give him in charge of some sheriff
to keep in the hoosgow till we’ve made our killing,
and are ready to deliver the whole batch to
Uncle Sam’s nearest U. S. District Attorney,
at Los Angeles or San Diego. That clear to you,
Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say it was, boss, an’ here’s hopin’ we’ll
get there with both feet when the end shows up,
our prisoners hobbled, an’ with nice new steel
bracelets decoratin’ their wrists. Now to get
the gent aboard the boat, an’ stowed away.
Shucks! he acts like he might be scared out o’ a
year’s growth—some sillies get that way ’bout
goin’ up in a skyscraper the fust time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>His scorn for such a weakling showed in his
face as he helped Simeon to clamber into the
cockpit. The man was as white as a sheet, and
trembling as if expecting to meet with some dire
end in short order, once he left the firm ground
and took to the boundless air. His groans were
heartrending, and Jack felt sorry for the wretch
but for once Perk displayed no signs of sympathy,
it was all so silly in his opinion.</p>

<p class='c013'>He proceeded to take precautions by fastening
the greenhorn in by means of a stout strap which
would prevent his falling out should conditions
necessitate a sudden banking on the part of the
pilot, or a fierce gust of wind cause the ship to
give a unannounced plunge.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All ready, Jack,” announced Perk, after
completing these arrangements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll be with you inside of three minutes,” he
was told, and as the ground ahead had been examined,
and found to be fairly good for the
wheels to trundle over, there seemed to be nothing
more that could be done, only put things to
the test.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was “some rough,” as Perk told himself,
when violently shaken once or twice but they
managed to get up sufficient speed to admit of
Jack lifting her when the right time arrived.
Then they were off, rising like a bird, and almost
immediately opening up the village that nestled
there two miles off, at the foot of the low ridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack headed straight into the west, for that
was their route “as the crow flew.” He cared
not at all that they would pass directly over the
settlement, for few of the people were apt to be
abroad at such an early hour, nor would they
be any the wiser for seeing a plane pass overhead
at such a low altitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, looking down, found himself wondering
which of the modest cottages in line of his vision
chanced to be the home Simeon had spoken of
with such a catch in his voice. The man had
temporarily forgotten about his fears concerning
his own safety, while being carried so high above
the surface of the earth—he was stretching his
neck, and eagerly focussing his staring eyes on
one spot, which evidently held all that he held
dear. Perk ignored his recent sensation of scorn,
and actually felt sorry for the man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor guy,” he was saying under his breath,
though the other could not have heard him had
he shouted at the top of his lungs, on account of
the racket being kicked up by combined motor
and propeller, “he feels right bad ’cause he’s
goin’ off without a chanct to say goodbye. Well,
I on’y hope this will be a lesson to Simeon, an’
he’ll quit playin’ with a buzz-saw, which is the
long arm o’ our Uncle Samuel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon tried his best to keep tabs of the lonely
little hamlet until it was no longer possible to
distinguish objects, owing to the several miles
of distance the speeding plane had covered; then
he fell back in his seat, and let his head drop
on his chest, while his body shook with emotion.
In that dreadful moment he would undoubtedly
have only too gladly given all he had in the wide
world for a chance to undo the wrongs he had
committed in his haste to get rich.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! he orter thought o’ that before, while
the goin’ was good!” was Perk’s comment, who
had seen just such short-sighted men more than
once before in his eventful life, and had a philosophical
mind concerning all such late repentances.
“But I’m sure sorry for them that are
agoin’ to suffer the most—he deserves all he’ll
get, but they’re the innocent ducks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The plane soared along its set course, and as
they were not at more than something like five
thousand feet altitude, Perk could see very well,
when he adjusted the binoculars they carried of
necessity, so as to be able to spy out conditions
before trusting themselves to land, being naturally
a bit suspicious while thus drawing steadily
nearer to what might well be called enemy land.</p>

<p class='c013'>From time to time he found himself gazing
down with considerable curiosity upon scenes
which were mostly foreign to his eyes—he had
only too often scrutinized pictures where uncounted
troops belonging to the enemy were encamped,
or on the march, with monster guns
making the very air quiver with the tumult of
their discharges; where rival pilots came up in
answer to his insulting challenge, to engage him
in deadly combat—he had seen many an unlucky
or less skillful airman go down with his whirling,
blazing coffin, yielding up his life as a tribute
to what he called patriotism—all these and a
multitude of similar thrilling spectacles could
be unrolled in memory as he thus sailed the
azure sky, and saw Jack meet and conquer successive
air pockets lying in wait to give him battle;
and yet this was actually the first time Perk
had ever focussed his gaze upon a genuine cattle
ranch, and saw stock being driven to market,
or it might be mavericks branded; so that he
found himself entranced with the panorama
spread before him as they glided over the prairies
of New Mexico.</p>

<p class='c013'>There cropped up other and like interesting
sights when the wilder sector of country was
reached, with its deep gullies, its bare-topped
mountain peaks—perhaps stretches of desolate
desert where nothing could be seen save billowy
sandy wastes, except possibly patches of yucca,
sage, greasewood, and prickly pear cactus.</p>

<p class='c013'>When, his interest increasing, Perk begged
his comrade to drop down so as to give him a
nearer view of these strange sights, he was able
to increase his knowledge concerning the myriad
of strange sights to be picked up when touring
by air in new territories—now he could make
out the fantastic Joshua trees that seemed to be
engaged in a shimmering dance in the blazing
sunlight; moving shadows that sometimes crossed
the line of his vision he made out to be buzzards
on the wing, circling in search of their carrion
meal; while others on the ground he recognized
as coyotes skulking along, frightened by the sight
and noise coming from far over their heads, and
trying to reach their secret dens in some rocky
canyon or defile.</p>

<p class='c013'>Noon came in due time, with the ship keeping
up its steady grind, and having left hundreds of
miles in its wake.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk began to realize that he had eaten his
breakfast at an unearthly hour, and concluding
that a bite of something, together with a swig of
water from their jug, might go well, he mentioned
the interesting fact that the usual lunch
hour had come, at which Jack nodded his head,
as if to leave all that sort of thing to the discretion
of his trusted pard.</p>

<p class='c013'>So they had a pick-up snack, which was quite
acceptable to the two airmen, able to enjoy their
meals even while cutting capers up among the
clouds. It was another thing to the novice
Simeon, whose appetite had not come back,
though he did manage to swallow a few bites,
and have a drink of cold water to wash things
down. By slow degrees he was getting the upper
hand of his dreadful fears, for while familiarity
could not be said to bring contempt, nevertheless
he was becoming accustomed to the conditions,
and could even display a trace of curiosity
when looking down on some unusually interesting
spectacle to which Perk was pointing so
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>If things continued to exist as they had been
doing all morning it was likely—Jack at one time
told his co-pilot in answer to a question—that
they would be close to the California border by
sunset, or shortly afterwards; since even then
they were well along across Arizona, with fair
skies still beckoning them on their way.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch23' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIII <br /> <br />ON TO THE COLORADO</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Listen, Perk, I’ve got something you should
know—something that hinges on a change of
plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was saying this at a time when, relieved
from the controls he could enter into one of the
little confabs that their use of the ear-phones
allowed. All Perk had to do was to lean forward
and while still handling the stick drink
in whatever his co-pilot chose to say.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! spit it out then, partner,” was his familiar
way of inviting confidence and which
meant so much with those who knew Perk’s peculiar
sayings best.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be sure Simeon Hawkins was sitting close
beside Perk, and what Jack meant to confide in
his running mate could never be intended for
his ears but despite this elbow to elbow touch
there was not the slightest risk of his being able
to pick up a single word, owing to the clamor
kicked up by motor exhaust and propeller.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re going on a bit further than was arranged,”
said Jack, concisely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! meanin’ we don’t pull up when we
strike the border, eh, what, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just that, brother—the going is good, and
we might as well keep moving till we drop down
on the Metropolitan Airport grounds.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whoopee! you mean at Los Angeles, don’t
you, old hoss?” demanded Perk, apparently considerably
surprised by his pal’s bald statement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Righto, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How come, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get this fixed in your noodle,” said the resting
chief pilot—“circumstances often alter cases,
they tell us; well, when we figured on halting at
or near the border, close to the Gila River,
things hadn’t happened such as have hit us since
then.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Meanin’ the storm, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was one thing,” admitted the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Knockin’ us out o’ our reckonin’, like, an’
makin’ us take a forced landin’ on the open
prairie where we run across that flimsy ol’ shack—does
that cover what you mean, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“After a fashion it does,” the other told him,
adding: “like the play of Hamlet, with Hamlet
left out, it falls flat. You omitted the chief reason
for my making this change in plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess you must mean Simeon here, eh
boy?” asked Perk, as if suddenly waking up to
the fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing—what are we going to do with
<i>him</i>, tell me, Perk? It’d be impossible for us
to lug him everywhere we mean to go, flying
across into Mexico, and baiting the wolf in his
own lair, as you might say. He’d be a constant
hindrance to our being free to act besides, we’d
run a fat chance of having him give us away,
just when we thought it was all over but the
shouting.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, Jack—it means you don’t trust his
promises to lend us a helpin’ hand, and goin’
back on his pals—ain’t that the idea?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it,” replied Jack, never bothering
to drop his voice a particle, knowing as he did
that without the aid of those valuable ear-phones
Simeon, humped up against the side of Perk,
could not have caught what was said even
though it had been shouted at the top of his
voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what then, partner?” continued Perk,
apparently still groping in the dark.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing to hinder our tripping right along
till we fetch up at Angeles, when we can find a
way to hand him over to the Federal agents located
there. He’s connected with the big gang
against which Uncle Sam’s declared war to the
knife; and as a material witness, ready to turn
State’s evidence, they’ll be only too well pleased
to hold him <i>incommunicado</i>, so he can’t do a
thing to warn the bunch the big push is on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Okay, Jack. Sounds mighty good to me,
you bet. I’d never a cudgeled my brains enough
to hatch up an idea like that; takes you to think
o’ clever dodges, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then we’ll consider it settled, eh, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just what we will,” came the confident reply.
“’Bout when ought we raise the last beacon
on the road to Angeles, an’ lamp the field
lights at that same Metropolitan Airport?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! if everything goes well, you might call
it along toward midnight,” Jack assured him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got aplenty o’ gas to carry on that far, I’d
guess?” hazarded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s to be hoped so,” said Jack; “because
there’s some mighty tough stretches of country
between the Colorado and the big Pacific city.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! so I understand, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And it would be a bad job for us if we had
to hit the ground where you couldn’t scrape up
a decent landing place with a fine-tooth comb.
When I take the stick again, Perk, maybe you’d
better have a look in, so’s to get tabs on our fuel
tank, and tell me how it stands. From the dial
finger yonder I figure we’ll have a lot more than
enough to see us through.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s right, boss,” affirmed Perk, after casting
a hasty glance at the tell-tale figures so
plainly marked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That settles it then,” with which remark
Jack showed by his actions that further conversation
was needless.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Simeon sat there through it all, never
once dreaming how his fate was being so calmly
settled; doubtless he imagined the consultation
had been about something connected with the
running of the cloud-chaser, and covered facts
such as would have been all Greek to him, even
had he been able to listen in.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was not at all bothered by this change
of plans on the part of the head pilot—it mattered
little when they managed to drop down at
the airport—chances were the ground lights
were kept on full through the whole of each
night, since air mail planes would be apt to
come and go, some of them having been thrown
out of their regular schedules by dense mountain
fogs, or head winds that cut down the customary
speed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, also, was well acquainted with the
courtesy to be encountered at all such well conducted
flying fields, where every one would be
eager to do whatever was possible for the comfort
of those who chose to visit such ports, and
show little or no undo curiosity connected with
the reason for their coming.</p>

<p class='c013'>True, they might turn out to be a bit short
with the “eats;” but Perk, who knew the ways
of his pal so well, felt certain Jack would see to
it they had a chance to “fill up” as soon as they
could strike an open restaurant, of which there
should be no lack in such a wide-open city as
Los Angeles, with its sporty crowds at Hollywood.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was moving on apace, and
there cropped up fresh thrilling sights every little
while, for Perk to stare at through his useful
glasses. They were following the course of
the famous Gila River toward its confluence
with the still better known Colorado, which
hundreds of miles further north passed through
the Grand Canyon country, most majestic in a
panorama sense of any region on the face of the
globe.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along about nightfall they might expect to
pass over Yuma, located close to the junction of
the two rivers. Perk wondered once or twice
why his pal had not decided to land there, and
turn the prisoner over to some one in authority;
but he felt certain Jack had good reasons for
not attempting this.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe, now,” Perk told himself, with Jack
again running the ship, while he attended to
some of his own manifold duties; “he
guessed there might be a bad crowd at Yuma—fellers
apt to be in cahoots with the same
gang o’ daredevils Simeon here was connected
with; and who might even try to effect his escape,
so as to shut his trap—even go so far as to
knife the poor skunk to make sure he didn’t
peach. Oh! yeah, that’s the way Jack looked
at it, bet your boots it must be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Soon afterwards the sun gave notice that it
was about to withdraw behind the line of mountains
lying toward the west. Jack had his bearings,
and expected to be able to pick up the flash
beacons arranged for the convenience of the air
mail corps in their night flights to and from Los
Angeles. So thoroughly has this all been
mapped out, with the signals to be found about
every ten miles, that a pilot can see as many as
three ahead at one time, depending on the altitude
at which he may be flying.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such wise precautions had been taken that
would make night flying just as safe and easy as
during the daytime one thing only cropping up
from time to time to raise trouble, and cause delay
was the presence of the fogs that were apt
to rise from the deep canyons, to blot out those
friendly gleams of flashing light marking the
air mail course from start to finish.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch24' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIV <br /> <br />SIMEON GROWS DESPERATE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was commencing to grow dusk when they
sighted the lights of Yuma, that town on the railroad
leading to Los Angeles. Such a thing as a
plane flying overhead was so common these modern
days as to hardly excite any comment—they
came and went, with seldom anything out of the
usual taking place although not so very far
away, among the mountains, one of the most
dreadful of all air tragedies known to the annals
of flying had taken place, when the great
liner <i>City of San Francisco</i>, lost in a storm,
struck head-on against a rocky cliff, shattering
the ship and causing the death of every one of
those aboard, some seven souls in all.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now they had left Yuma far in their rear, and
Jack was watching to pick up the first flash beacon
on the way to the Coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>The weather continued to favor them, the
heavens being almost devoid of any semblance of
clouds, and the air quite cool at the height they
maintained while heading into the beckoning
west.</p>

<p class='c013'>Over deserts and mountainous stretches they
kept swinging along, to the constant accompaniment
of the customary chorus of a bustling plane
threading the mighty air lanes of the skies. The
silvery stars came out in battalions to sprinkle
the azure heavens like innumerable bright lanterns,
such as could be seen in Old Japan during
carnival times.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was the life, Perk told himself again and
again, sitting there after he had munched his
scanty portion of their meagre supper, Simeon
having again declined to share with them—what
air pilot who has tasted of the joys of such hours
could ever dream of forsaking his vocation, so
long as Fortune allowed him to retain his vision,
hearing, and the faculty for guiding an onrushing
ship through the realms of unlimited space—not
he for one, Perk assured himself, drawing in
huge draughts of the clear air, and watching the
wonderful beacons as they passed them by,
threading the pathway of the stars as it were,
straight toward their distant goal.</p>

<p class='c013'>The night wore on, with the voyagers making
splendid progress.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had made no miscalculation when saying
he believed they would fetch up at their destination
somewhere about the midnight hour; for
it still lacked more or less of that time when in
the near distance they glimpsed lights telling
that the city, and its nearby aviation field, must
be close at hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they found themselves circling over the
port, which, just as Jack had fancied would be
the case, was lighted most brilliantly. Even as
they sighted the field they noted a ship settling
down, evidently an air mail plane that had
been held up by some dense fog belt which they
had fortunately missed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Soft snap I’d call it, droppin’ down with all
them field lights to show the ground, so a feller
c’n see a rock the size o’ a baseball,” was what
the tickled Perk was telling himself while Jack
was proceeding to make the terminal drop, with
several ground attendants hurrying up so as to
lend any assistance needed.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had received his instructions from Jack,
and removed the handcuffs from the wrists of
the prisoner. There was no necessity for letting
everybody know the facts and the sight of a
man wearing steel bracelets, and gripped by an
attendant never fails to excite keen curiosity with
most people and especially would this be the
case if he had just come by the air route from
some unknown and therefore mysterious quarter.</p>

<p class='c013'>He would keep his arm through that of
Simeon, and inform him in a forcible whisper
that should he attempt any “funny business” it
would be at the risk of being shot down without
further warning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack would attend to everything necessary,
such as having their crate stowed away in some
convenient hangar, where it could be recovered
at any time, by paying such charges as were
customary.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be sure Perk was questioned by several of
the men while Jack saw that the ship was being
taken care of but when he chose, Perk could keep
a still tongue in his head and since he paid no
attention to what was said, and never opened his
mouth in the least, possibly they concluded he
must be both deaf and dumb.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk may have chuckled deep down in his
throat when he heard a few of the disgusted
remarks some of the men exchanged concerning
his lack of speech and hearing but
he kept his own counsel; and in the end Jack
came up saying he had secured a taxi to carry
them to a small hotel down in the heart of the
city, recommended by one of the hostlers who
seemed to know what he was talking about.</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon had looked a bit anxious, as though
wondering how their arrival at Los Angeles
would affect his wretched fortunes but he made
no attempt to appeal to the crowd for help.
Undoubtedly he was firmly convinced that the
grim Perk must be a man of his word, and that
any attempt on his part to break away would
prove a most serious matter indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah!” Perk was telling himself under his
breath when he took note of this humble disposition
on the part of Simeon, “Guess now he feels
it’s a heap better to be a live fool than a dead
hero; an’ by jinks I don’t blame the beggar for
thinkin’ thataways either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon all three safely lodged in the
taxi—which fortunately had remained up to this
late hour, the driver hoping to pick up a fare—and
heading for the nearby city.</p>

<p class='c013'>Later on they entered the small hotel, and
found it all the obliging ground attache at the
port had said. Jack registered the party, all of
them under fictitious names, since it paid to exercise
due caution when on the track of big game
just as it would for the big game hunter to make
no sound when advancing upon an enormous
tusker or “rogue” elephant whose spoor he had
been trailing through forest and jungle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Would it be possible for us to have some
supper sent up to our room?” Jack asked the
night clerk who shrugged his shoulders as if
dubious concerning his ability to accommodate
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kindly try to have it done, if double price
will have any effect,” continued Jack, using his
most gracious smile that usually accomplished
his purpose and at that the clerk responded by
saying he would do his best but it was of course
most unusual, and he hoped they would not make
any complaint if the variety was not all they
might wish.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quantity is the chief thing that interests
us,” said Jack; “you see, we have come
by air, and fell short of food while on our way,
so that my two pals here are very near being
starved; so whatever you send make it a fairly
bountiful spread, please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they were shown to their room, which
contained a double bed and a cot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I kinder guess now, partner,” said Perk, after
flashing a glance around the apartment, fronting
on a back lot, though up in the third story of the
building, “you an’ me better share the bed, while
Simeon gets his little nap on the sofy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That goes, Perk,” his comrade told him
“and after we’ve had supper we’ll hit the hay.
After such a broken night as we had back a ways
some sleep ought to be welcome, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! hope we don’t have to wait too tarnel
long for the grub,” Perk was saying, dismally
rubbing his stomach, as if to show how flat it
seemed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack engaged him in conversation of a general
character, just to keep his mind from dwelling
on the subject of eating for once Perk let himself
believe he was in danger of famishing and
he just could not subside but must commence
to marshal all the known dishes of which he was
especially fond, and keep on taunting and tantalizing
himself by stringing them off as might a
glib-tongued waiter in any restaurant.</p>

<p class='c013'>After quite a tiresome wait there was a knock
at the door, which Perk hastened to answer.
Two waiters strode in, bearing trays laden
with a pretty substantial assortment of food—quite
a satisfactory display, Jack thought, considering
the late hour, and that probably the regular
kitchen force must have long ago turned in
or else gone home.</p>

<p class='c013'>The table fairly groaned under the assortment—Perk
pertinently mentioned the fact,
adding that he guessed he’d do his share of
groaning <i>after</i> he had finished his supper which
Jack did not doubt in the least, having a knowledge
concerning the other’s vast appetite, and
unbridled disposition to make a pig of himself
at such times when food was plentiful.</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon Hawkins was coaxed to sit down with
them and as his state of mind seemed to have
improved quite a little, he also partook of food
of which he most certainly was much in need,
having fasted so long and abstemiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>When this ceremony had been carried through
to a finish, the supply of visible victuals had been
wonderfully reduced; and even Perk was heard
to declare he could not eat another bite, which
meant he was like a stuffed turkey, fit for the
Thanksgiving table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before turning in, Perk took occasion to “talk
like a Dutch uncle,” as he termed it, to Simeon,
assuring him he need not be in too upset a state
of mind concerning his future, since Jack had
said he was bound to do all he could to have him
let go, because of what he had confided to them,
and such assistance he would be able to lend the
Government in convicting the head men of the
lawless conspiracy along the counterfeiting line.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other nodded his head as though he
understood that, having embarked in the game
of throwing down Slippery Slim, he realized
there was nothing else for him to do but go
through to the windup.</p>

<p class='c013'>So confiding Perk, thinking things would run
smoothly, took off some of his outer garments,
and rolled into bed, as it afterwards turned out,
happily choosing that side of the same nearest
to the windows of their room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack soon followed, and the last thing he noticed
ere snapping off the light was the humbled
Simeon wrapped in a blanket, and lying there
flat on his back, as though meaning to get what
sleep he could during that fragment of the night
still remaining.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was, so far as appearances went, sound
asleep; but then sometimes things are not just
what they seem. To tell the truth, Perk had
made up his mind ere lying down that he would
“sleep with one eye open,” as he called it, meaning
it was his intention to keep on the alert, ready
to jump out of bed at the least sign of trouble.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps when he thus decided it was with a
hazy idea they might have some sort of unwelcome
visitor during the night; he could not just
decide how this could be but then those unprincipled
agents of the counterfeiter king—like
the fellow who had rifled the belongings of
Scotty, the air mail pilot in Atlanta—were liable
to turn up anywhere, everywhere, when least expected,
and try to manipulate their bold games.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hearing some sort of sound as of a person
moving, Perk suddenly sat straight up in bed,
to see their prisoner in the act of crawling over
the sill of the nearby window, evidently bent on
giving them the slip!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch25' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXV <br /> <br />THE STAGE SET FOR BATTLE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Hey! you, lay off that stuff!” was the way
Perk exploded, even as he made a wild dash
across the floor, and clutched the reckless Simeon
by the arm, dragging him back into the room
by sheer strength.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other struggled but feebly perhaps he
was really horrified at the desperate chances he
had been about to take.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, you must be goofy, Hawkins, to try that
sort o’ game!” Perk went on scornfully,
as the wretched man writhed on the floor where
he had flung him. “Don’t you know it’s two
stories down to the roof o’ that extension; an’
chances are you’d a got a broken neck, or leg,
in the drop. Better make up your mind to take
the medicine an’ stand it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack of course had been aroused at the first
movement of his chum, and sat up in bed watching
the actions of the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Trying to take leg bail, was he, Perk?” he
remarked. “You can hardly blame the poor
dick, come to think of it because he’s rubbing
up against a tough proposition. Better put the
bracelets on him again, and tie his ankles together
he might get loco, and try to jump out
of a window, just to end it all and that would
be too bad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon, utterly cowed and silent, made no resistance
when Perk followed out his pal’s advice.
There were several hours of the night still remaining,
and they might as well secure such
sleep as lay in their power, since no one could
predict what sort of strenuous activity awaited
them in the near future.</p>

<p class='c013'>Came morning, and the two air detectives
were stirring.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another right fine mornin’ for us,” Perk remarked,
blithely, as he looked out of the window,
and made a grimace at seeing what a nasty
drop had awaited the desperate prisoner had he
succeeded in carrying out his plan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! that’s the usual program, I understand,
out here on the Coast,” Jack told him. “Hardly
ever see any rain in this blessed country; that’s
why they have to depend on irrigation for their
crops.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Plenty to keep us hoppin’ today, I kinder
guess, partner, eh, what?” volunteered Perk, as
he started dressing, after removing the stout
cords that had been wrapped about the lower
limbs of the Federal prisoner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never said truer words, boy,” Jack
added “got to settle about this business of having
our friend here held until the gate’s been
crashed, and our scoop put through. Then I
mean to have a good talk with several people in
the Government offices, who can give us a few
points that so far we’ve been missing. You can’t
pick up too much information when aiming to
stack up against smart lads like this Slippery
Slim. He’s got so many eyes on the watch the
chap who expects to corral <i>him</i> must get up right
early in the morning, and pull the wires in a
dozen different directions. I’d a heap rather
overdo the matter of taking precautions than to
let just one ragged end get loose, for a game like
this is only as strong as its weakest link.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do we eat here, or look up a restaurant?”
asked Perk, quite naturally, since it was the
easiest thing in the world for his thoughts to
turn toward the subject of catering to the loud
demands of his stomach, when the usual time
for meals came around.</p>

<p class='c013'>“On the whole I reckon it’d be as well for us
to stick around, and have breakfast fetched up
here,” suggested jack. “I’ll step down presently,
and see if it can be managed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just as you say, partner,” Perk told him,
grinning, to add: “Make her two fried eggs and
a rasher o’ bacon for me; also a big cup o’ coffee
with a stack o’ wheats done brown. Say, you
might add some toast, and an orange, seein’ that
this is California, an’ a feller ought to patronize
the fruit industry when happenin’ to visit the
Coast country. Guess that ought to fill a vacuum
okay, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Leave it to me, Perk, and you’ll never starve
to death I’m a good provider, and Uncle Sam
foots the chuck wagon bill.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When later on two waiters appeared laden
down with a mass of dishes, Perk grinned some
more, and looked quite joyous; for the odor of
coffee and bacon always pleased his sense of smell
as nothing else could.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Simeon had apparently about decided to
make the best of a bad bargain, for he began
sniffing as though the idea of breakfast appealed
to him—he certainly needed something to brace
him up.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along about ten o’clock they prepared to set
out for the offices of the Federal forces in Los
Angeles. Simeon had finally given his word not
to make any further attempt at escape. Jack had
been talking seriously with the fellow ever since
breakfast, trying to squeeze further information
from him, and holding out hope that if he “came
clean” he might yet be allowed to go back to his
family after the Government had made use of
him to send the leaders in the wide flung conspiracy
to prison for long terms.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again a convenient taxi was called upon to
convey the trio to their intended destination.
Both Jack and Perk evinced considerable curiosity
concerning the unfamiliar sights on the
streets. They asked numerous questions of the
driver, who chanced to be a communicative sort
of fellow, and filled them up with information
about the sunny queen city of the Coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not long before Jack’s magical passport,
sanctioned by the Big Boss at Washington,
brought them in contact with several high officials
who apparently had been secretly apprized
of their presence in the West, and had
also been requested to afford the two daring sky
detectives all the assistance possible in carrying
out their plan of campaign.</p>

<p class='c013'>So it came about that Simeon was taken off
their hands, after the story of his capture had
been told. Jack secured a promise that the man
would be lightly dealt with because of the valuable
aid he had already afforded the sleuth-hounds
of the air branch of the Law.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both of them shook hands with the pitiful
looking chap as he was taken away by a marshal
who had been summoned and who would see
that he was kept aloof from all other prisoners
until his testimony was wanted in court.</p>

<p class='c013'>After that they fell into a general talk, Jack
telling the deeply interested officials about the
stirring adventures befalling himself and Perk
since they first struck Atlanta, where the drive
really had its beginning.</p>

<p class='c013'>In return he was given such information as
had been gathered in connection with more recent
happenings along the line of Slippery Slim’s
operations and the fact of the matter was there
always seemed to be fresh outbreaks of the bogus
money disease in this or that part of the whole
Southwest, as new agents started to work virgin
territory until by this time the greatest unrest
and uneasiness existed among all Government
ranks.</p>

<p class='c013'>The balance of that day the two pals put in
taking a look around the city, visiting Hollywood,
and seeing a number of movie stars whom
they recognized from familiarity with their faces
on the silver screen at various times.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack paid another visit to Federal Headquarters
on the succeeding day, to gather up all
loose ends, and decide on his plans while Perk
took himself off to look up some old friend, who,
he understood, was making good in one of the
new big pictures.</p>

<p class='c013'>They met again late in the afternoon, with
Perk displaying signs of nervous tension for
almost the first thing he said to his chum was in
the shape of a leading question, which Jack undoubtedly
anticipated, knowing Perk’s headlong
nature as he did, and the habit of the other for
seeking speedy action.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wal, what’s the good word, old hoss—when
do we skip out from here, if so be it’s all set?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No more hanging fire, brother,” Jack assured
him, smilingly “we’re loaded for bear this time,
sure pop. I’ve been out at the airport, and had
a full tank of gas put aboard the crate as well
as all that stuff you sent over so’s to keep us from,
starving to death.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bully boy!” crowed the delighted Perk; “jest
can’t come any too soon to please me. I’m only
cravin’ a chanct for a set-to with the head o’ this
flim-flam bunch, who’s laughed at the Government
boys just once too often. Is it tonight,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Midnight ought to see us several hundred
miles on our way, if all goes well,” Jack told
him, not displaying any outward signs of jubilation
himself, although he undoubtedly must be
thrilled by the thought of how they were now
about to put everything to the test, and match
their wits against that astute schemer, for whom
the Federal prison doors were yawning so widely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never gimme sweeter words, old pal!”
Perk was saying, backed up by one of his most
hideous grins.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch26' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVI <br /> <br />ON THE FACE OF THE MOON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Jack proved as good as his word, for they were
off shortly after nightfall, and headed almost
due east. No one at the aviation field had the
remotest idea as to who they were, what their
destination might be, and whence they came.
But then this particular port was becoming a
very important link in the trans-continental
chain, with lines of great passenger and freight
airships going and coming not to mention the
several speedy air mail boats that covered their
hundreds of miles day or night and as a rule on a
schedule that seemed as perfect as that of any
train time table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was unusually silent, at least for him.
Perhaps he was realizing at last the serious
nature of the job they had undertaken—that it
was rather a weighty proposition, such as was
bound to require all their united reserve force
to put across.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still, he had absolute confidence in Jack’s
ability to swing the undertaking, and also refused
to allow anything like doubt to assail him
with regard to their united courage.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was by this time well understood that the
climax, when it came, would occur on Mexican
soil for now that all accounts from every quarter
were in hand, they knew absolutely that the den
of the counterfeiting gang was in a secret cave
among the mountains of Sonora also that the
sagacious Slim had bought protection from certain
local Mexican officials, who were suspected
of secretly plotting a new revolution, and took
this means for obtaining the money needed to
purchase arms in the States.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was even said that Slim never flew back to
his headquarters without loading his swift plane
with a dead weight of guns and ammunition as
the price he had to pay for being allowed to operate
undisturbed on foreign soil.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A pretty kettle of fish, I’d call that sort o’
game,” Perk had indignantly asserted, when he
learned of this see-saw method of currying favor
with the plotting generals who hoped to once
again turn the country upside-down and kick
the present rulers out of office, as well as seize
the city banks with their rich booty.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so it was, but Jack realized how it accounted
for the long spell of immunity Slim had
enjoyed while he lined his pockets, and spread
that financial panic throughout the Southwestern
States. There never had been his equal as a skillful
worker and bold lawbreaker; one who knew
how to set neighbor against neighbor, and make
every one work so that he could rake off a heavy
dividend from each separate deal.</p>

<p class='c013'>So he had for a long time been coming and
going, crossing the border, as a rule by the air
route, carrying his cargoes of deceitful bank bills
to various distributing points—like the one Jack
and Perk had struck by sheer accident—gathering
the genuine stuff contributed by his numerous
dupes, and leaving bulky packages of the wonderfully
executed spurious notes in exchange.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a veritable Golconda for the industrious
worker, who, safe from interference, had kept
as busy as the proverbial bee, that stores honey
day after day.</p>

<p class='c013'>They followed the line of swirling beacons
the air mail boys were in the habit of trailing,
since by this means they could pass some of the
numerous danger spots on their route. In good
time Jack expected to turn his back on these
friendly flashing lights and head due south, to
cross the border, and fly over foreign territory.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had been placed in possession of certain
secret documents issued by the Mexican government,
which proved how they knew of the unholy
alliance made between Slim, the counterfeiter
king, and those traitorous generals who yearned
for fresh outbreaks so as to pamper their own
personal fortunes, just then at low ebb.</p>

<p class='c013'>There existed something of an arrangement,
whereby the Mexican government agreed to
stand back of any effort made by the Department
at Washington to capture Slim, smash his gang
that was widening its powers every day, and
clean out the mess of near-bandits with whom he
had allied himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>If it were necessary all arrangements had been
made whereby Colonel Jose Morales, with a
crack regiment of hard fighting regulars who
had seen much bloody service in bringing the
defiant Yaqui Indians to terms by invading their
mountain fastnesses, and meeting them hand-to-hand—was
stationed within a day’s ride of the
ravine where Slim had his plant and could be
summoned by means of certain smoke signals.
No sooner would these “talking smokes” be detected
than the order would be given “boots and
saddles,” with the mounted regiment in full
swing for the debatable ground where Slim had
his nefarious nest.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, too, had a secret arrangement been effected
with the old leader of the now defunct Texas
Rangers, most of whom were in the service of the
Government connected with the border patrol
and orders had been given the former gallant
hero that if a certain message were received, no
matter by what method, he was to gather a squad
of his old fighters, and cross the border, sure of
being warmly received by the loyal Mexican
troops who would welcome his assistance in wiping
out the sore spot that had been so long a blot
on their country’s honor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus it would seem that everything possible
had been done toward striking a telling blow.
It only remained for Jack Ralston to start the
ball rolling, when it must gain fresh impetus
with every revolution.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk acted as though decidedly pleased when
later on he discovered that they no longer followed
the flashing beacon trail—Jack had gone
as far as was judicious along that line and now
headed straight into the mysterious south, toward
the border of the neighboring republic where
disorder still held sway, and disgruntled chiefs
continued to plot against the rule of the recently
elected president.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every mile traversed now was bringing them
closer to their goal, and Perk found more or less
joy in picturing the thrilling climax, when they
would give Slippery Slim the surprise of his
life—if only no leak concerning their clever plan
had come about.</p>

<p class='c013'>The moon had risen, and was hanging there
in the east, a silvery shield with one edge clipped
off telling that the queen of the night was already
well past her “full” stage and running for
a fall.</p>

<p class='c013'>All at once Perk had an electric shock.</p>

<p class='c013'>He leaned convulsively forward and gripped
his mate by the shoulder, at the same time pointing
toward the southeast and shouting through
the head phones:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look, oh look—see what’s passing across the
moon, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then just as suddenly did he release his clutch,
to fall back in his seat, and exclaim most dramatically,
with a touch of disgust in his voice:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! It’s slipped past, dang the luck!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But I got it all right, Perk,” the pilot assured
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it <i>was</i> a ship, an’ my lamps didn’t fool
me, partner?” Perk cried in renewed excitement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As sure as you’re born, that’s what it was,
brother,” Jack added.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Headin’ south, same as we’re doin’ right now,
eh, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, buddy—just what the crate was
doing, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the answer—could it a been <i>him</i>, on
his way back home with a load o’ machine guns,
life they say he carries every time he crosses the
border, after takin’ out a freshly printed batch
o’ his flimsy stuff to soak on the honest folks back
home?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s something we can only make a stab
at,” replied Jack. “Chances lean that, way, I
must say; but just the same it might have been
some mail plane that’s got blown off its regular
course, and is beating it for the home port. Then
again I understand the border patrol are handling
a few ships in their line of intercepting flyers
making a business of smuggling Chinese aliens
across the line night-times.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d give a heap to know the answer to that
puzzle,” continued Perk, who disliked enigmas,
and all that sort of thing calculated to make a
fellow lie awake nights, bothering his poor
brains. He never had been fitted by Nature for
the job of being a real detective.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll never know,” his pal told him, “unless
it happens we run afoul of the other crate when
our courses draw closer together and if it’s Slim
whose fingers grip that stick we’d rather be excused
for having that happen—our job is to fetch
him back <i>alive</i>, and not make him lose his life
in a crash.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me, I ain’t peticular just what <i>does</i> happen
to the slick guy,” Perk wound up the little talkfest
by saying. “Only, when it comes to a real
showdown either Slim or us got to go to the
wall—dead or alive, the thing’s goin’ to be settled
for keeps!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch27' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVII <br /> <br />THE SIERRA MADRE CHAIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Another thing Perk noticed—this was the fact
that Jack seemed to have changed his mind with
regard to making haste for the ship was racing
along at top-notch speed, as though engaged
in a race with some unseen rival.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hey! what’s the big idea, Jack?” he called
out, when this thing had been going on for some
time, and his burning curiosity could no longer
be held in leash. “Why doin’ the sprintin’ act,
I’m awonderin’?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Less chance for us to run foul of that other
boat if we forge well ahead, don’t you see, partner?”
exclaimed the pilot, sententiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! that’s a fact,” returned the enlightened
Perk. “An’ then mebbe it’d be jest as well for us
to get there ahead o’ the boss in the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m aiming to do that,” he was told.
“It happens that we can’t keep on in the boat till
we strike close to his hideout—the racket would
stir the whole bunch up like a hornet’s nest you’ve
kicked when going through the brush, with the
mad critters swarming out to tackle you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you now, Big Boss—never did think
o’ that before. Then I kinder guess we’ll
have to hike some little way,” and there was a
vein of chagrin in the speaker’s voice as he mentioned
this fact, since walking and Perk never
did seem to agree very well—like most flyers he
had been spoiled for all manner of pedestrianism
by his ability to cover such vast distances
without moving his pedal extremities an iota.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s our sure enough program,” Jack told
him, doubtless thinking that the delayed knowledge
might allow his pal to make up his mind
about swallowing the bitter medicine without a
single grimace.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not long after this little break when
Jack again spoke:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve a good idea we’re across the line now,
partner,” was the information he passed along.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sounds good to me, okay,” commented Perk,
with a tinge of solid satisfaction visible in his
voice as though having a possible rough-house
job to handle, the sooner he got busy the sooner
it was likely to be over.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And making more than an even hundred
miles to the hour in the bargain, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some punkins about comin’ in swell on the
last lap, this crate sure is, I’d say, partner.
Licketty split she humps along like a reg’lar
witch. I guess now she’d make rings around
that ol’ boat Slim’s got hold o’ though it
answers his purpose seems like. But see here,
Jack, you never did tell me jest how you got word
to that same Colonel Morales down here in
Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was given my instructions, and sent a telegram
to him at Hermosilla, in care of Padre
Lopez, giving him the order he was expecting—during
the last hour we were in Los Angeles.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! then the sojers must be in the saddle
right now!” burst out Perk, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If the arrangement went through without a
miss that’s like enough a fact,” admitted Jack;
“the way my plan’s arranged everything must go
off with the regularity of machine work, each
separate part dovetailing, so as to work in full
sympathy. If anything lags, and goes amiss, it’s
apt to throw the whole scheme out of gear, you
understand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! I grab what you mean, partner,” said
the astounded Perk; “but I got to hand it to you
when it comes to hatchin’ up big things—it’s jest
wonderful how you manage. An’ I sure do hope
everything’ll slide along like greased lightnin’,
once it gets started.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had planned to drop down in some isolated
spot where with the coming of dawn, with
the aid of the strong glasses they could pick up
the rocky Sierra Madre range with its canyons
and valleys, where, unless all his leads have been
false clues, those whom they sought would have
their secret den and stronghold.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk got to thinking these matters over, and of
course he was bound to run across some things
that still seemed a bit hazy in his mind. Accordingly
he sought for information at headquarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, now, d’ye know I’m jest beginnin’ to get
on to why you had the wings an’ fuselage o’ this
here ship painted the color o’ sand—took a pattern
from the way they striped the steamers on
the Atlantic durin’ the big war, an’ colored batteries
on the battle front, so flyers couldn’t pick
’em out to drop their bombs down on—camouflage,
ain’t that the right word, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Slow to get on to my little schemes, partner;
but in the end you make a smart stab—yes, that
was what I had in mind, for I knew we’d have
to park the old bus somewhere in the open; and
I didn’t want any hostile eye to glimpse her from
a soaring plane, or a mountain crag—for you see
I reckoned Slim was too smart a lad not to have
binoculars handy so as to watch for trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>More than ever was Perk impressed with an
overwhelming admiration for the ability of his
pal to lay plans capable of covering every possible
necessity that could arise in carrying out
the job they had tackled.</p>

<p class='c013'>He asked no more questions, confident that
everything was bound to move along smoothly,
when the casting of the play was in such capable
hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Anyway,” he told himself as he thus pondered,
“we ain’t seen anything more o’ that moon
ship, which makes it certain we’ve knocked her
outen the runnin’. Wonder now if that was really
an’ truly ol’ Slim, totin’ a swell bunch o’ machine
guns, so’s to bolster up the new revolution
they say is bein’ fostered an’ nursed in this corner
o’ poor ol’ Mexico. Queer what international
jingles a feller c’n get mixed up in, when he runs
in harness with Uncle Sam’s revenue boys; but
it’s all pie to me, just the same, ’cause they allers
did say my middle name was Scrap.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was now starting to make use of the binoculars,
which were fitted with lens capable of
making them useful during the night-time, at
least when there was a certain amount of moonlight.
In a general way Perk could decide where
to turn his attention, for it went without saying
that the mountain chain lay toward the southeast
for had he not studied the lay of the land
upon the small but accurate map with which
Jack had armed himself before leaving Washington
to take up this hazardous adventure?</p>

<p class='c013'>When he felt assured that he could make out
the distant ridges he announced his pleasing discovery
to his mate and then at the other’s request
took over the controls so that Jack in turn might
use the glasses and thus make assurance doubly
safe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bank, and head more into the east,” Perk
heard the other saying, after a steady look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it’s the Sierra Madre okay, partner, I
opine?” suggested the one at the stick, as he
obeyed orders.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question about it,” Jack assured him “but
I knew it was time for us to sight the ridge. I’ve
pored over the map of this section, and charted
it all out in blocks, so I can tell just what the lay
of the land is, and how long it’s apt to take the
colonel to get here with his galloping company.
We’re going to drop down presently, and find
shelter where we can lie low until the hour comes
for making our ten strike.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How long might that be, boss?” asked Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It all depends on certain happenings. We
can creep up close to the place, and watch how
things move figuring out how to act when you
get your first glimpse of a dust cloud away off
toward where Hermosilla lies. I give the cavalry
two days to reach here, if everything moves along
smoothly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Two long days—an’ say, we gotter eat all that
time, don’t we, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We surely can’t live on air, Perk; but I’ve
provided for that—even should we run out of
grub you laid in I’ve a little deposit of dried
meat, real pemmican in fact, that will keep us
from famishing. Water we can secure somewhere
among the mountain trails, since never a
drop would we be apt to find on the open desert.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! I’m leavin’ it all to you, Big Boss,”
Perk told him, again lost in wonder and near
awe as he realized how Jack seemed to have
thought of everything—what a mind the boy had
for grasping details, and weaving them into the
net with which they expected to enmesh the slippery
one.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now Jack slowed down their speed more or
less, although of course it was not possible to
soften the clamor accompanying their flight
through space. But Perk noticed that, so far as
he could tell, the night wind was coming from
ahead, and this assured him it would not be apt
to carry those telltale sounds toward the range
lying in the east, and so warn the enemy of their
coming.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch28' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVIII <br /> <br />CLOSE TO THE TIGER’S LAIR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“We’re about due for a landing, Perk,” finally
announced the pilot, after he had used the glasses
for a spell, and again took over the stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! some hike that’s agoin’ to be, I’d say,
old hoss,” grunted Perk; “but I guess it can’t
be helped—got to take the bitter with the sweet
lots o’ times—the way o’ the world, seems like.
Go to it then, boss; if anybody c’n make a safe
landin’ by moonlight it’s jest you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>His confidence was not misplaced, as Jack
proved when he brought the ship down in as
perfect a three-point drop as the best of aces
could have carried out.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’ll have to lie here till we need her again,”
he observed, on climbing out of his confined
quarters, and stretching his cramped legs after
the manner of air mail pilots in from a long and
irksome run.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk stared around him—they were on the
sandy desert without a doubt, and off toward the
east could be seen the dim crests of the high and
ragged peaks comprising the main ridges of the
Sierra Madres—old-time home of the fierce
Yaqui Indians, whom the soldiers of Mexico had
for so many years labored so hard and in vain
to conquer; nor was it until the day the airplane
came along that they were able to accomplish
this much to be desired end.</p>

<p class='c013'>But now other equally annoying thorns in the
flesh had made a hideout of those same
inaccessible mountains—defeated aspirants for
the presidency of the Republic, always generals,
took to gathering groups of malcontents and mercenary
adventurers in these mountain depths,
defying the troops sent to rout them out, and
proving the latest source of trouble in the political
problems of the authorities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack soon completed his preparations for
abandoning their ship. He looked it all over, to
satisfy himself its camouflage would prevent it
from being sighted by any air pilot chancing to
pass overhead at a reasonable altitude then he
gathered a few articles, the possession of which
might turn out to be of value when it came to
closing the mouth of the bag and finally announced
himself as ready to make a move.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got all you wanted, Perk?” he inquired, incidentally,
for he had reason to feel certain such
was the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! from the binoculars an’ my rifle, down
to what’s left o’ the eats,” the other assured him.
“Guess we’ll get along somehow or other.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! don’t bother your head about the grub
part, comrade; I’m carrying a small packet with
me that holds enough to keep two men alive for
a whole week—all we’ll have to do is to run
across some sort of spring, where we can get all
the drinking water we’ll need, while we wait for
the wagon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! in this case you’re meanin’ a <i>hearse</i>,
’cause mebbe we’ll have to shoot him up afore he
calls quits,” and Perk grinned horribly at his
own wit.</p>

<p class='c013'>So they left the ship stranded there, sprawled
out like a gigantic dragon-fly or a monstrous
toad. If Fortune proved kind they might yet
live to make good use of it again when the time
came to fly back to God’s country on the other
side of the border where defeated candidates
are in the habit of accepting the dictum of the
voters, and retiring from the field of battle await
the next call to arms, with ballots instead of
bullets as their method of settling elections.</p>

<p class='c013'>Side by side they set forth, like a pair of adventurers
starting out in search of Fortune’s
smiles, and careless alike as to whether they met
with success or not, so long as the excitement
they craved came their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk managed to conceal the chagrin with
which he buckled down to his unwelcome task,
walking always gave him a pain, mental rather
than physical but on the whole he was a good
scout, and could follow the beckoning finger of
duty, even though he loathed the conditions attached
to the performance of his role.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sand was far from compact, and allowed
them to sink in somewhat, so this made the going
more difficult in contrast to that on the seashore
which being beaten down by incoming waves is
often as hard as concrete and a pleasure to walk
over; whereas this of the desert was dry and
sifted at the least puff of wind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk having had some previous experience
with deserts, felt no love for the uninviting waste
places of the earth only such useless vegetation
as sage, greasewood, cactus and yucca would
grow between the sand dunes amidst the blistering
fangs of the infernal heat and always vowed
he disliked such arid regions with a violence too
deep for mere words.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet he kept his own counsel and plodded away
alongside his pal as if he had no personal feelings
in the matter whatsoever. Far off in front
of them they could see the line of peaks studded
against the sky once or twice Perk felt certain
he had caught a fluttering light aloft such as
might spring from a passing plane but in every
instance he finally decided it must be some shooting
star, ducking behind the mountain range,
leaving a trailing wake behind that but reflected
its passing glory.</p>

<p class='c013'>One hour, two, and then a third dragged along
before Jack thought fit to call a halt. Never did
poor weary footsore Perk, almost used up, listen
to more welcome and delightful words than
when Jack as he drew to a halt went on to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Time to rest, partner, you know—I’d like to
find a bunch of shady trees that would afford us
a decent shelter from the blazing sun, should we
be so unfortunate as to get adrift after leaving
all landmarks behind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! bless you for sayin’ that, buddy,” Perk
was saying hoarsely, for his throat seemed as dry
as tinder, the fine sand even affecting his vocal
cords so that he would not have recognized his
own voice. “By your leave I guess I’ll lie down
and get the kinks outen my legs. Wow! that
must abeen fi’ miles if she was one—my shoes
are full o’ sand, an’ altogether I don’t feel half
the man I was on startin’ out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There are some trees over yonder, you may
notice, Perk; so after we’ve caught our second
wind we’ll take chances, and cut across to where
they lie, perhaps when morning comes tripping
along, we may climb up the face of the mountain
and get a look-in at the printing establishment
that’s set itself up in opposition to the U. S.
Treasury Department, and the Federal Bank.
Come on then, a little further where we can drop
down, and rest our weary feet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards the pair had crept in
among the sheltering trees, where Jack called a
rest, although under the impression that they
should get along further before break of day.</p>

<p class='c013'>He talked matters over with his partner, speaking
almost in whispers, since in this enemy country
no one could take anything for granted and
for all they knew hostile ears might chance to
be close by, ready to listen in.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Perk himself who proposed to move
along while the going was good.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like we might be a heap better off, old
hoss, if on’y we located up thar on the side o’ the
mountain, where we could see without our bein’
watched. I’m okay now, an’ ready for b’ar.”</p>

<p class='c013'>That was the spirit Jack liked in his mate—a
readiness to take hold and reach a decision. They
moved along toward the base of the forbidding
height, keeping a watchful eye on the eastern
sky lest dawn come and surprise them in the
open, where it would not be easy to find a hiding
place during the entire day.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fortune favored them, for they managed to
get under cover before the first gray streaks appeared
in the east. It was bound to be a strenuous
task climbing that formidable mountain side
but Jack had prepared for even this part of the
adventure.</p>

<p class='c013'>From various sources he had learned how there
were three separate means for subduing that
grim pyramid of rocks and trees and tangled
growth—in order to lessen the chances of discovery,
with unpleasant consequences, Jack had
decided to try and negotiate the most difficult
of these mountain trails in the belief that it
would offer a safer passage since evidently none
of the seething revolutionists, or their allies, the
bad men from across the border, would be likely
to follow that canyon trail when others less difficult
could be utilized.</p>

<p class='c013'>Down there hidden by the bushes and spurs
of outlying rock they employed their time in
munching what must serve as their breakfast.
Then quenching their thirst at a convenient
pool they proceeded to climb the face of
the steep elevation, making for the quaint hollow
in the crater of a long dead volcano and which
had once been a Yaqui fort.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch29' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIX <br /> <br />NEARING THE GOAL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>They had now reached that most thrilling
point in their bold venture, where they would
have to “watch their steps” most carefully, lest
an incautious act precipitate a calamity that must
end all their hopes as well as snuff out their
lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>This breeding place for inflammatory embers
of Mexican revolutionary disappointed political
generals, and their immediate retainers, was
about as safe for the two sky detectives as a cage
of Bengal tigers would have been once let their
presence be suspected, and the entire neighborhood
would be scratched over as with a fine-tooth
comb in the endeavor to discover their
hiding place and should they be rounded up it
needed no magician to prophesy what their fate
must be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack led the way, with Perk following at his
heels, every sense on the alert. The native cougar
of that historical group of mountains could
hardly have crept along with greater care than
did the two human sleuth hounds of the law.
Every advance was attempted only after a careful
survey of the entire neighborhood—at the
sound of some faint bird-call Jack would sink
down and flatten himself upon the ground, his
example being imitated by his shadow.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this caused their progress to be exceedingly
slow but time did not enter into their calculations
so much as security—many hours must
pass ere Jack could figure on the arrival of those
upon whom everything depended and they
might as well make use of the entire morning in
climbing higher and higher toward their ultimate
goal.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once when they chanced to be resting their
tired limbs, snug in a sheltered nook behind a
mass of brushwood, Jack turned and looked back.
The site was especially fine for looking out on
the level stretch toward the spot where they had
landed during the preceding night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, watching the actions of his comrade,
could easily give a close guess as to what Jack
had in mind. This opinion was made more convincing
when he saw the other get out the useful
binoculars, and apply them to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Keenly he kept tabs on the others and was
finally thrilled to note the pleased nod Jack gave
as if wholly satisfied.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk touched him on the arm, and as Jack
turned made motions with his head, while his
eyebrows went up, his expression without a single
word being spoken signifying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How come?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take a look for yourself, and tell me if you
can get the first glimpse of our old crate” suggested
Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ doin,” whispered Perk, after a most
diligent search; “an’ if we can’t get a whiff o’
the boat, with these glasses, I kinder guess
nobody ain’t agoin’ to locate it with their naked
eyes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which same lets us out from any danger in
that quarter,” came softly from Jack, whose face
for the moment lost some of the strained look it
had borne during the last few hours.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never saw a better sample o’ camouflage
when I was across the big pond alistenin’ to the
smash o’ the rip-roarin’ German guns,” asserted
Perk; and then “dried up” when he saw the
other press a finger on his lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>Higher they climbed, like monkeys, taking all
manner of desperate chances when necessity
arose but so cautious was Jack in leading the
way that nothing amiss came about, every obstacle
being successfully surmounted until
shortly before the noon hour they found themselves
in a position to spy upon the camp of their
intended prey.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was intensely interested in what he now
visioned. The old crater, resembling an immense
football bowl, as adopted by some Eastern
colleges, looked as though it might have proven
well nigh impregnable as a fortress where the
fighting Yaquis were able to hold an army at
bay—which feat history records as an actual fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>Scattered about the depression were scores of
rude dwellings, some built of rocks, while others
more modern had walls composed of sun-baked
bricks, known throughout all Mexico as <i>adobes</i>.
Men and women, also children, could be seen
moving about, preparing the noonday meal or
partaking of their customary frijoles, hot tamales,
or it might be maize cakes cooked in the
hot ashes of fires, and with black coffee as a
beverage.</p>

<p class='c013'>The picture appealed to Perk, who delighted
in novel scenes nor did it seem to lose any of
its thrill from the fact that, as he very well knew,
the men he was staring at so eagerly were most
likely as tough a brand of desperadoes and villains
as could be grouped together anywhere on
earth—ready to fight, hold up trains, or commit
all manner of pillage at the drop of a hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>He marveled at the sagacity shown by Slippery
Slim in deciding to join forces with these
firebrands of the back country, with the idea of
thus securing the greatest safety for his own
lawless operations.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this while Jack had been keeping close
watch, in hopes of being able to pick out the
figure of the man he had been deputized to bring
back to the States so he might be prosecuted for
his crimes, and sent to Atlanta. There he would
possibly end his days in seclusion, with a large
portion of the Southwest breathing more freely
since they need no longer fear the avalanche of
counterfeit currency that had been demoralizing
business for such a long spell.</p>

<p class='c013'>After all it was Perk who made the discovery,
he chancing to be carefully handling the binoculars
at the time. He handed the glasses over to
his mate, and told Jack just where to look, using
as few words as possible, and keeping his voice
very low.</p>

<p class='c013'>Long and earnestly did Jack follow the movements
of the remarkable character who had been
described in his hearing so many times. What
satisfaction it afforded him to know he was actually
in sight of the big game and if only his
plans carried through his hour of triumph was
steadily drawing closer and closer. In imagination,
as he continued to watch the moving figure,
he could vision the pleasure it would afford him
when he could turn in his report to his Chief,
and mark it as completed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon drifted along, and night approached.
Nothing could be done to hasten the
crisis; they must wait patiently, and continue to
shape their plans until the expected smoke signal
told them Morales and his rough riders had
reached the foot of the Sierra Madres ten miles
further south and when assured by means of a
counter signal that everything was working well,
start to cover the last lap of their long ride, leave
their mounts at a safe distance, and complete the
journey on foot.</p>

<p class='c013'>When darkness fell the picture was even more
fascinating to Perk than before, with a number
of fires lighting up the huge bowl, the sound of
women chattering in Spanish, and children playing
just as all youngsters might do while from
time to time he could catch strains of music, telling
that some amorous swain might be practicing
on his guitar, as all who have a drop of Spanish
blood in their veins invariably love to do when
at leisure.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk doubtless made many a grimace while
partaking of the light refreshment afforded by
the tough pemmican Jack had produced, as their
sole means for staying their empty stomachs for
when the evening breeze wafted some of the
odors from the cooking fires down below it almost
set him wild with a desire to partake of hot
food. But he knew what he was up against, and
sternly repressed the inclination to groan his
protest.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was one of the longest nights Perk ever
knew. The mountain air, too, was cold, especially
along toward the last few hours and since
they were debarred from the joy of indulging
in a campfire, Perk could only lie there and
shiver. He never was so glad to see the pink
sky in the east as on that occasion.</p>

<p class='c013'>The day was but a repetition of their former
afternoon with their sole recreation being the
chance it gave them to watch Slippery Slim’s
movements whenever he appeared coming out of
what seemed to be a cavern of some sort from
which at several times when the racket from many
tongues died down Perk could catch a strange
rumbling sound, accompanied by what seemed
to be a blow, and which he could easily believe
must be the working of the printing press that
had been carried all the way from the States in
order to be able to produce those wonderfully
clever notes that had deceived many shrewd
bank tellers by their deceptive qualities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then at last Jack discovered, just as night had
begun to fall, three columns of smoke rising toward
the heavens from far down the wild Sierra,
telling how that Morales and his troop had arrived,
and that the curtain was about to rise on
the last scene of the international drama.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch30' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXX <br /> <br />JACK GETS HIS MAN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Immediately on discovering the welcome signal,
Jack dispatched Perk to put a match to the
heap of brush they had arranged well out of sight
from the depression where the skeleton revolutionary
army was slowly assembling its pitiful
force of the dissatisfied generals who had been
counted out in the last national election.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk understood what was expected of him,
and managed to send up a single smoke signal,
allowing it to have but a brief life and then hastening
to smother the fire. As Morales was expected
to be on the watch for just such a sign,
he would lose little time in starting to carry out
his part in the attack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In three hours they will be climbing the
mountain by way of the old Yaqui trail we followed,”
Jack was telling his chum, when the
other returned to his side, flushed with the success
of his labors. “It is time for us to make a
forward move, so that we may be ready to strike
as soon as the camp quiets down and corral our
man, leaving it to Morales to carry the fort itself
by storm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This they set about doing without any further
delay. Dodging from rock to rock, taking advantage
of every outlying spur, as well as patches
of hardy bushes, and other objects that were
likely to conceal their movements from any
watchful eyes but always creeping downward,
they crawled along like two great lizards such,
as Perk could remember seeing when in the
Philippines.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the time they were ready to slip into the
underground pressroom of the lawless printing
company’s plant, Jack figured the three hours
had just about expired, and that it was now up to
them to make the first hostile move that would
precipitate the assault.</p>

<p class='c013'>In thus deciding to make a start he was influenced
by seeing an agreed upon signal from
the same hiding place he and Perk had held for
so many hours, and which told him the troopers
had finally succeeded in climbing to the position
assigned to them when plans for action were
formed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Flattening themselves out against the dark
wall of a small cliff Jack and Perk glided along
until they arrived at that aperture in the solid
rock they knew to be the entrance to the wonderful
underground retreat that had been described
by Simeon at the time when in his desperation
he gave his confederates away and from which
they had watched Slippery Slim come and go
during those long hours of their espionage.</p>

<p class='c013'>Slipping inside, they found themselves in a
corridor that led into the body of the mountain
with a gleam of light beckoning them to advance.
In this fashion they kept moving, gliding from
one point to another, until eventually they had a
clear view of the little machine that was working
so industriously in turning out the bogus
money, hour after hour, as though the demand
were without limit.</p>

<p class='c013'>How Perk did stare, and hold his breath when
realizing that they were upon the verge of accomplishing
their great undertaking. Slippery
Slim was doing no actual manual labor himself,
but he kept close watch over the two men who
ran the press, closely scrutinizing the printed
bills as if to detect the slightest inaccuracy, and
correct it without delay.</p>

<p class='c013'>No wonder, Jack told himself, the product of
his skill had startled the financial world by its
genuine appearance, when such a master in his
particular line took such personal pains to see
that the work was carried out in its most minute
details.</p>

<p class='c013'>In whispers Jack informed his backer what his
duty would be when the roar of guns and hoarse
shouts from without announced that the picked
troopers had actually launched their long deferred
assault. Jack had taken it upon himself
to close in on the chief worker in that little
coterie, and have the glory of capturing Slippery
Slim unaided but meanwhile Perk might find
plenty of action in holding up those two others
who were second in importance only to the leading
figure.</p>

<p class='c013'>The tension had become almost unendurable
when suddenly there broke out a frightful uproar—women
were shrieking, children’s high
pitched voices told of intense alarm; men gave
tongue, and above it all guns began to sound with
deadly import, until the basin rocked with the
dreadful clamor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack waited no longer, but giving Perk a kick
on the shins to tell him to get busy he rushed
headlong toward Slippery Slim, holding his automatic
ready for instant service, knowing as he
did that such a desperate bad man as Slim
was reckoned from all accounts, would not be
apt to surrender so long as there remained the
slightest chance for a getaway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nor was he mistaken in judging the character
of the man who had so long defied the shrewdest
detectives of the United States Secret Service
for when Slim found his way to the open air
barred by such a determined looking figure, he
snatched out his handy gat and made as if to open
fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>For once he was just a trifle too slow with his
service gun, for Jack, clever lad that he was
along the line of firing off-hand, managed to send
a bullet through Slim’s right shoulder that crippled
him, so that his own weapon went rattling
to the stone under his feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put ’em up!” Jack was saying, covering his
man as he spoke and having no desire to commit
suicide, Slippery Slim obeyed the call; and
instantly afterwards suffering the painful ignominy
of having his wrists encircled by a pair
of nice new steel bracelets.</p>

<p class='c013'>So far so good, with Jack, his own share of the
capture an accomplished fact, able to turn in
order to lend Perk a helping hand. It was not
needed, for Perk had descended on those two
muscular chaps like a thunderbolt, knocking one
down with a terrific jolt under the chin and
causing the other to look along the short barrel
of his blued automatic, he having discarded the
repeating rifle for the time being in favor of
the easier handled pocket gun.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the trio of discomfited rogues were all
handcuffed, Jack and his reliable partner turned
and faced the other way, so as to be ready for a
rush, should some of those valorous generals
decide to take advantage of the defensive security
of the rock cave, and bolt into its gaping mouth.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being actually attempted they met with
a demoralizing surprise when they found themselves
the objects of a hot fire, that brought about
a complete right-about face movement and
presently forced their ignominious surrender to
the gallant Colonel Morales and his fierce fighters,
who had once before gone through an interesting
campaign in that same old extinct volcano
vent, with warlike redskins as their opponents.</p>

<p class='c013'>The end was not long in coming, with many
of the would-be revolutionists holding up their
hands in complete surrender others escaping
by losing themselves along the scraggly sides of
the mountains and not a few either slain outright,
or seriously wounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and his chum had a chance to meet the
doughty Colonel Morales, pride of the Mexican
army, and be congratulated on their clever work
of rounding up such a jack-o’-lantern, fly-by-night
as Slim Garrabrant. Of course the two
comrades were eager to start back to the other
side of the border, since complications might
come up over their legal warrant to arrest a criminal
so badly wanted by the Washington authorities,
but who had made his headquarters south
of the international line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly they handed over Slim’s two lieutenants,
who would have to answer to a charge
of being hand-in-glove with those plotting generals,
and doubtless find themselves incarcerated
in a Mexican dungeon for some years, a fate that
made Perk shudder to contemplate.</p>

<p class='c013'>While he stood guard over their prisoner, Jack
sent Perk off at dawn, mounted on one of the
cavalry horses, and accompanied by a soldier
who would fetch back both animals, Perk’s duty
being to get the stranded ship off the ground,
and drop down at a more convenient spot closer
to the former mountain stronghold of the tiger-like
Yaquis.</p>

<p class='c013'>By nightfall they were hundreds of miles on
their way over Arizona and New Mexico, Jack
having decided to carry his prisoner, whose
wound did not prove to be very serious, though
painful enough—all the way to Washington, and
present him to his superior, with his customary
air of not realizing that he had done anything
extraordinary.</p>

<p class='c013'>That this thrilling feat was only a common
occurrence in the lives of such intrepid manhunters
as serve the Government through the
agency of the Secret Service and that from time
to time Jack and Perk might with reason be
expected to duplicate such adventurous feats can
be set down as certain; indeed, the title of the
next number in the Sky Detective Series, “<i>Eagles
of the Sky; or With Jack Ralston Along the Air
Lanes</i>,” a tale of the smugglers of the Florida
Coast, will grip the reader from start to finish,
and prove to be one of the most thrilling stories
ever written for lovers of action and valor.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent
permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.
Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered
throughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809
North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email
contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the
Foundation's web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

For additional contact information:
     Dr. Gregory B. Newby
     Chief Executive and Director
     gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

  <h1 class='c010'><span class='xlarge'>THE SKY DETECTIVES</span></h1>
</div>

<div>
  <h2 id='ch01' class='c011'>CHAPTER I <br /> <br />READY FOR THE TAKE-OFF</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>It was a day in the late Fall when Jack
Ralston, accompanied by his best pal, Gabe
Perkiser, known simply as “Perk” by all his
friends, found themselves climbing out of a
hired taxi that had halted on the border of
Candler Flying Field just a short distance out
of Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! reg’lar mob out here today, seems
like,” observed Perk, as he took note of the
triple line of cars parked around the field, with
its numerous up-to-date hangars, and with ships
coming and going every few minutes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, you see Perk, it happens to be a big day
at stunt flying, with fat prizes for the winners.
All the better for us, I’d say, since our take-off
will hardly make a ripple in the pond, with all
this confusion going on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing, my boy,” continued Perk, with
one of his humorous grins that betokened a good-natured
chap; “and privacy’s just what we crave.
I guess now that might be the mail comin’ from
down East an’ New York?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A rotten guess then, Perk,” chortled the
other; “Eastern mail boat was due here at six-ten
this morning; the Pitcairn Aviation concern
handle that route, as well as the run between
Atlanta and Miami down in Florida; and I’m
telling you for a fact the boys holding the stick
with <i>that</i> corporation are nearly always on time
to the dot, come storm, come fog as thick as
pea-soup. The schedule I glimpsed at the Atlanta
post office gave the time of the East Coast
ship as seven-thirty P. M.; that from New Orleans
at six-thirty P. M.; and the one from
Chicago about the same time. So you see it
couldn’t be a mail crate dropping down right
now, unless they’d had to make a forced landing,
and lost time in making repairs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, come to think of it I sure did hear a
bus passin’ over just at peep o’ day,” admitted
Perk. “Let’s have a look-in while we’re here,
and see what a bag o’ tricks these stunt flyers
are holdin’ up their sleeves, so’s to give this
crowd a row o’ thrills.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suits me, Perk; no great hurry about our
jumping off, so long as we pull the gun before
dark sets in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! little difference it makes on a patch
as well lighted as this Candler Field o’ your
home city, old boy; and with a flashlight beacon
set every ten miles all the way down to Orleans,
to keep us on our course. Look at that guy
fairly burning the air like hot cakes—he must
be tryin’ to beat the speed record, I guess, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hardly a day comes without some record
going by the board,” remarked Jack, who had
a reputation as a safe and sane pilot, although
on occasion he had been known to put through
some tricks so death-defying as to make the
hearts of the spectators seem to jump up in
their throats with the thrill.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was quite correct when he stated that
Atlanta was the home city of his close friend
and chum; although Jack’s family had moved
away years back, and become fruit raisers in
far-off California. Still, having spent some
years in the Georgia capital Jack always liked
to drop in and renew a limited number of old
friendships when opportunity offered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack Ralston had begun his aviation work
starting at the lowest round, that of a Gypsy
pilot, flying an ancient boat at County Fairs and
Harvest Home gatherings; doing aerial stunts,
and “bailing out” by means of a parachute while
another pilot ran the ship; also taking up air
minded “sand-bags” as passengers at so much
each person.</p>

<p class='c013'>From this modest beginning he had finally
accepted a position with an aircraft corporation
having contracts with the Post Office Department
at Washington for carrying the mails, and
later on express matter as well; and last of all
working for Uncle Sam through joining the
Secret Service corps of skillful detectives, whose
activities covered every part of the Nation, and
even to adjacent countries as well.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the Government wearied of the bold
doings of one “Slippery Slim” Garrabrant, and
decided to “clip the wings” of that audacious
freebooter and bogus-money crook, it was only
natural they should pick Jack for this service.
The reasons for doing so were many, but what
counted most was Jack’s well known cleverness
as an all-round air pilot; for it happened that
the slick rogue who had been giving the revenue
men such a wild-goose chase, with his thumb
held up to his nose, so to speak, was himself a
remarkable master of the air lanes, he having
been an ace as a flying pilot over with the army
on the Argonne front in France.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since as a rule this troublesome offender carried
on his bold enterprises by means of a handy
plane—frequently with a single assistant, who
helped handle both ship and cargo—the man
thus selected to put a crimp in his activities was
likewise given full permission to engage a helper
from the same arm of the Government forces,
one who must of course know something about
the handling of a plane, so that in case of necessity
he could serve as co-pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack lost no time in picking Gabe Perkiser,
otherwise known simply as “Perk”—a man who
had supped with adventure since he was “knee
high to a duck”—a half Yankee—half Canuck,
drifting into the army, and serving with the
sausage observation balloon corps over in
France; from which patriotic occupation he
later on became a champion light-weight boxer.
Leaving the ring while as yet undefeated he
served for several years with the Canadian
Mounted Police. Here his smartness in usually
fetching back his man, no matter what the difficulties
that had to be surmounted, attracted
the attention of a gentleman connected with
Uncle Sam’s Secret Service, just then moose
hunting over the northern border, who finally
influenced Perk to join up with his force.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and the other had met under peculiar
conditions when both were tracking a bunch of
check raisers floating across the country and
leaving a wide swath of victims in their path.
They had become more than friends, although
meeting but seldom; then, when the opportunity
came for Jack to call upon Perk to join him in
the new job that had been turned over to his
charge, the latter had responded with alacrity.</p>

<p class='c013'>So here they were, on the threshold of an
affair that promised to engage their united talents
in running down the leader of the most
troublesome gang of counterfeit currency makers
known to the Government agents in the last
ten years.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every clue possessed at Headquarters had
been turned over to Jack at the time he was
given authority to carry on as the situation demanded;
although this information was a bit
limited, and much was left to the shrewdness
of the two trail hounds themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no hurry at all, and Jack had
always been one of those cautious workers who
meant to provide for all sorts of emergencies.
Only too well did he know how many a splendid
undertaking went on the rocks from lack of
foreseeing the next move on the part of the
astute criminals whose apprehension meant so
much to the Government, as well as the folks
they were victimizing.</p>

<p class='c013'>But by now he had decided everything was
arranged so far as human means would permit,
and that it was high time they started on their
long chase. Their boat, a Stinson Detroiter, a
monoplane with a Wright Whirlwind motor,
and reckoned to be an unusually swift craft, was
already loaded, and ready for immediate departure.
It had been stored in one of the big
hangars connected with the Candler Flying
Field but could be taxied into position when
Jack felt ready to skip off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their flying togs were also contained in a
locker in the same hangar, and could be donned
in a jiffy, even to the ’chute harness that was
so familiar to Jack, and a constant reminder of
early experiences when he was accustomed to
carry out his daily program of “quitting the
ship” with as much <i>sang froid</i> as though the
jump into space from a five thousand foot ceiling
were absolutely next to nothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>But plainly Perk was becoming a bit restless,
as though eager to be on his way; which fact
doubtless influenced Jack to eventually give the
word that took them to their hangar. Here
they commenced preparing for a night flight
that was expected to land them in New Orleans,
where Jack was to interview a certain representative
of the Government service, from whom
he anticipated receiving a few valuable tips that
would give them something tangible and serve
as a beginning of their arduous chase.</p>

<p class='c013'>While they were thus engaged someone
hailed them with a boisterous greeting, at which
Perk grinned, and made a suitable reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hey, Scotty, this your night off, is it—got
in from your route okay, and stepped out to see
the boys cut a few figger-eights in the sky—just
can’t keep away from the game, even when you
got a lay-off? What’s new, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They told me at the house you expected to
step off tonight, boys—is that a fact, or did they
slip an easy one over me, I want to know?” demanded
the other, who was apparently a mail
pilot friend of theirs—in fact, having the adjoining
room at the small hotel where they were
stopping.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” Jack told him, secretive as usual,
“we’re going further, and boosting the Stinson
Detroiter ship by showing what it has to set it
above most other boats. Plans not fully arranged
as yet, but we’re on our way; so it’s good-bye,
and good luck to you, Scotty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about that news, Scotty?” the insistent
Perk went on to demand, being by nature one of
those stubborn chaps who can never be happy
until they get what they are after, no matter
how trivial it may seem.</p>

<p class='c013'>The air mail pilot scratched his head, and
then with a grin answered Perk’s question.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much along the line of aviation;
but something queer happened to me—say, did
you boys sleep at home last night while I was
on the road?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We sure did,” Perk told him, and then
added: “What makes you ask that, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Didn’t hear any sort of racket in my den
did you, fellows?” continued the other; at which
Perk, after exchanging a look of bewilderment
with his pal, hastened to answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a thing, Scotty; but then you know I
sleep like a log; and it’d have to be a thunderclap
to wake me up; what’s been going on?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You got me guessing, Perk,” said the other,
with a look of disgust; “only when I got in this
morning I found my room looking like a hurricane
had struck it, my things tossed out of drawers,
my trunk broken open, and say, you never
saw such a dirty mess. Course I asked the boss
what it meant; but he was as much surprised
as I was—talked with every servant from the
cook down to Mary the chamber maid; but
nobody could tell a darned thing about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again Jack and Perk exchanged a swift
glance, as though the same idea had struck both
of them. Scotty did not appear to notice this,
being too worked up with the mystery that had
so suddenly gripped his fortunes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did you lose anything worth while, Scotty?”
Jack asked, in a voice that suggested sympathy;
but to his surprise the other shook his head in
the negative, and even grinned as he lifted his
heavy eyebrows to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s the funny part of it, boys; whoever
the sneak thief was, he didn’t even dent me a
little bit—so far as I c’n see not a blessed thing
is missing—fact is, I’m even better off than before
he paid that queer visit, ’cause he left this
old pocketbook mixed up with my traps; and
it ain’t mine for a fact, though I’m meaning to
spend the little wad of dough it holds. Like
manna coming down to the children of Israel
in the Wilderness, wouldn’t you say, boys?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lucky old hoss you are, Scotty,” remarked
Perk, enviously; while Jack nodded his head as
though to echo the sentiment.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c014'>CHAPTER II <br /> <br />THE LUCK OF SCOTTY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Happen to have that pocketbook along with
you, Scotty?” asked Jack, in a matter of fact
tone; just as though he might be possessed of
ordinary curiosity concerning so amazing a
visit; since never before had he heard of a night
prowler leaving his own money behind him,
when his intention had been to rob his victim.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing, Jack,” promptly replied the air
mail pilot; “here, take a squint at my Christmas
present, dropped in by old Santa Claus
a bit before the reg’lar holiday season,” and with
a laugh he chucked the object in question into
the hand of the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Old, just as you remarked, Scotty,” observed
Jack, “and used a long time. It must have
slipped out of his pocket when he worked your
stuff over to mix it up like the devil.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Open it up and see what the blessed chump
left me in place of his card,” the other continued,
looking exceedingly proud over his lucky
find.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did that with alacrity; in fact it
was what he intended doing, for reasons of his
own; something more than curiosity influencing
him, it would appear.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gee whiz! a neat little bunch of the needful,
I’d say, Scotty, old hoss!” burst out the envious
Perk, his eyes fixed full upon the contents of
the much worn pocketbook, which Jack was
holding in his hand and apparently interested
in counting, for there were a number of bank
notes for various amounts, and among them just
three five-dollar bills, seemingly quite fresh,
though a bit soiled, as though they had been in
circulation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nineteen smackers in all,” announced Perk,
showing that he had also been keeping tabs on
the count. “Well, wouldn’t that knock you cold
though? Huh? that same caller must’ve been
looking for <i>me</i>, and just missed connections by
striking the next door. Well, here’s wishing you
the same old luck every time a sneak thief pays
you a visit, Scotty boy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack on his part was feeling of the three five-dollar
bills, and holding them up to the light
from the western sun that managed to come
into the hangar by way of the open doors.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What ails you, Jack?” demanded the recipient
of Fortune’s smiles, as he noticed these
strange actions on the part of his new friend.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much,” he was told, “only I’m going
to give you a bit of advice, partner, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to it, boy; always willing to take it
when it seems sound!” snapped the mail carrier,
briskly enough, still more than curious.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you’re wise, Scotty,” went on Jack, smilingly,
“you’ll not try to pass any one of these
five-dollar bills until you’ve asked the opinion
of some bank teller—it might get you into
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Zowie! what’s that you’re saying, Jack—don’t
tell me they’re off-color bills, counterfeits
in fact. Wouldn’t that be a rotten deal to hand
out, and me figgering how I’d spend them? Is
<i>that</i> what you mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon it’s so, Scotty, much as I hate to
knock your good luck,” Jack told him, with a
shake of his head. “I happened to have a little
experience in a small bank some years ago and
they did say I showed signs of being a clever
detector of bad money. That’s a clever job all
right; but I’m afraid it won’t stand the wash
worth a cent. Go slow, and don’t count your
chickens before they’re hatched. Also I’d advise
you not to go around telling about your windfall
until you’ve shown this stuff to some friendly
bank official, whose advice you’d be willing to
take. If he says it’s good stuff why forget what
I’m saying, and go the limit. But we’d better
be finishing our own job, Perk, and get off on
our jump.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Scotty hung around for a short time, looking
puzzled, as though he hardly knew how much
to believe. What Jack had said in his friendly
fashion had doubtless cast quite a damper on
certain bright dreams in which he had been indulging.
However, he finally decided to take
himself off, evidently eager to know whether
the laugh was on him or not, for he called out:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goodbye, Jack, Perk; and be sure to look me
up when next you drop in at Candler Field Airport;
like as not I’ll still be on my old job here,
unless they decide to transfer me somewhere else.
And say, Jack, I’m meaning to take your advice,
and get an opinion on this here stuff ’fore I try
to pass it out on any old duffer. So-long boys
and luck!”</p>

<p class='c013'>When the two comrades, adventure bound,
found themselves alone they looked at each other
in silence for almost a full minute, when a grin
started to travel over Perk’s well bronzed face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, wouldn’t it jar you though, to have such
luck knock at your door, and then give you a sly
kick?” he demanded of his companion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To tell the honest truth, Perk, I’m not thinking
about Scotty and his queer windfall; it’s
our own great good luck that’s making me suspect
we’re bound to carry this job through with
flying colors.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Eh? now what d’ye mean by saying that?”
asked the other hastily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right in the beginning, Perk, we seem to
have stumbled on a nice little plum in the shape
of a clue—flung directly at our heads, you might
say in the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! do you mean to tell me those bogus
notes were off the same plates we’ve been
hearing so much about lately that I’ve been
dreamin’ I was tied hand an’ foot, an’ poked
under a dozen bales of them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just that, as sure as you live, partner,” said
Jack, composedly; but if he could take it so
coolly, not so his right bower who showed signs
of extreme excitement and satisfaction, for he
thrust out his hand, that had so often been an
object of vast respect on the part of some welter
weight boxer, and insisted that Jack accept a
gentle shake.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re sure Fortune’s favorites,” Perk was
saying, striking an attitude as he thus proudly
spoke; “an’ with such luck hoverin’ over our
heads I vow all the Lower Regions with its devils
can’t prevail against us. But see here, old hoss,
there’s more than chance in this break o’ the
party who broke through Scotty’s door, and
panned all his traps—I guess now he must have
missed a cylinder, an’ jest passed us by in a
ground loop.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was accustomed to the other’s quaint way
of expressing himself, for he lost no time in
adding:</p>

<p class='c013'>“About that way, I take it, Perk. And if
what we suspect turns out to be true, it stands to
reason there’s some sort of big combine back of
it all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“With this same Slippery Slim Garrabrant
pulling the wires for the whole bunch, is that
what you mean, Jack?” demanded the other flyer
quickly; for when once set on the right track
Perk’s mind could travel speedily enough.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s certainly his brain that’s built up this
wide flim-flam trade in the make believe green
stuff that’s been fooling a whole lot of bank tellers,
it’s so near the genuine article. To
smash the combine we’ve got to check up on
Slim; after he’s caged the entire arrangement’s
bound to fall through.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, partner; and them’s my sentiments
every time,” admitted the eager Perk. “And
here, when we’re starting out to pull off our
fresh stunt, I’m wishing all the luck that’s going
to our little game. Meaning to give her a last
checking over, eh, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s a habit of mine, as you know, Perk; and
you might amuse yourself stowing the cargo
we’ve taken aboard, so’s to let us have room for
our feet when we take off. From the looks of
the junk you picked up anybody’d reckon we
planned to go into camp for a week or two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, mebbe that’s what’ll happen to us before
we strike pay dirt in this ticklish job,”
asserted Perk, stoutly. “You know we figgered
things out, and made up our minds this same
slick article of a Slim might have his hangout
over the line in Old Mexico, where he prints
his bad bills, and then comes across the line with
a big bunch in his ship, so’s to scatter the stuff
around to his agents in Texas and Arizona, or
it might be all through Southern California. If
that guess turns out to be a bullseye we might
be away off the line of travel for days at a stretch,
and a grub stake’d turn the trick okay, I’m thinking,
boss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack made no reply, for he was already busily
engaged in looking over his crate. This was, as
he had mentioned, an old habit, contracted in
the early days of his career as an aviator of sorts;
and most likely such extreme caution had saved
his life more than once.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he too worked close by, Perk was thinking
more or less about something that had caught
his ever watchful eye just before they entered
the hangar to make these last preparations for
their southern flight. As usual he was unable
to keep his speculations entirely to himself, since
he always liked to compare notes, and find out
whether his companion’s views coincided with
his own.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, Jack, did you happen to notice that
Ryan ship they’d just taken out of the shed before
ours?” he demanded, while still lifting
packages of various supplies, and stowing them
away in a shipshape fashion; so they would not
be likely to shift, and thus imperil the safety
of himself and comrade, should they chance to
encounter rough weather later on.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not particularly,” came the answer. “I was
too busy over my own affairs to bother with anything
that didn’t concern me in the least. What
of it, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much, old hoss, only it was a next
to new bus, and hadn’t been flown more’n a few
thousand air miles, I’d guess. Couple of fellers
seemed to be the crew, one of ’em lookin’ like
he might be a pilot; and the other a chap that
was out to have a jolly good time sportin’ for
sport. I saw him handlin’ some sort of gun,
which made me guess he was down South for
the shootin’ season—mebbe after bear in the
Louisiana canebrakes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack laughed as if amused, for he had noted
the way in which the other made this stab at
what might be the designs of the unknown
parties.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Feel a bit envious I take it, Perk,” he observed,
laconically. “Always did yearn for the
day to come when you’d have a ship of your
own, and could spend all your spare time jumping
about the country, enjoying yourself with
rod and gun. Cheer up, old sport, you may live
to see that day yet, if things break right for us
in a few big games like this one we’re running
down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thanks for your good luck wishes, Jack,” the
other was saying; “I c’n just picture the bully
times that pair’ll like enough have sitting by
their camp-fire, living on game they’ve knocked
over, and not caring a darn whether school
keeps or not. Oh! well, if I live long enough
mebbe I may have a whiff of that kind of life
before I kick off for keeps; they say everything
comes to the man who waits, and that’s me.
There, that finishes my job, with everything
stowed away as slick as you please. When you’re
ready, Jack, we’ll be on our way.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c014'>CHAPTER III <br /> <br />HEADED SOUTH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Apparently Jack had completed his task
about the same time, for he was adjusting his
’chute harness, without which he seldom made a
long distance flight. This was only second nature
to him, because of the long experience he
had had in barnstorming, and doing stunts for
a living in years gone by.</p>

<p class='c013'>This accomplished, he stepped outside the
hangar, and beckoned to a couple of ground
workers who chanced to be close by, possibly
in anticipation of their services being required,
with a tip in prospect.</p>

<p class='c013'>Between them the ship was moved to the open,
and after that it would be a simple thing for
Jack to taxi across the strip of ground adjoining
the big Pitcairn hangar, so as to face such
wind as was stirring.</p>

<p class='c013'>With what Perk had said concerning the new
Ryan monoplane and its crew still fresh in his
mind, Jack did give a brief glance in that quarter.
He could only see that both men were fully
equipped with dungarees, helmets, and even
chutes fastened to their backs; which combination
was an effectual disguise, since their best
friends might have failed to recognize either
of them offhand.</p>

<p class='c013'>The one who was garbed in what seemed to
be fresh clean overalls, and who must be the
employer, seemed to feel a mild interest in their
movements, for he was looking that way through
his goggles, that had been pulled down as if in
preparation for some species of flight. The
other was busying himself adjusting something,
and from his greasy dungarees it was evident
he must be the working pilot of the Ryan craft.</p>

<p class='c013'>With all the bustle that was going on covering
the stunt flying and speed races, Jack did
not bother taking a second look; he failed to
have the same interest in the possible sporting
excursion of the unknown pair that had gripped
Perk and hence failed to let the matter occupy
any more of his limited time.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon both settled down in their respective
places in the double cockpit of the ship,
Jack of course occupying the front seat, since
he had been placed in command, with the other
acting as co-pilot and observer.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a very decent crate taken in all, that
had been secured for their work on this special
occasion, for Uncle Sam is never stingy in supplying
his agents of the Secret Service with
whatever they need, from means for swift travel
to the customary “grub” necessary to their upkeep
when “on the road.” These air detectives
in whom we are particularly interested just now,
as a rule were angling for big fish, and it was
absolutely necessary they should be given a free
hand when making their demands for proper
backing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it’s goodbye to Candler Field for us
right now,” remarked Perk, as he shot a general
look around, being more or less interested in
the exciting events being pulled off in the air
circus. “Playtime’s past, and now we’ve just
got to put in our best licks along the line of
business. Huh! seems like them two guys are
meaning to pull out right on our heels, from the
lively way that greasy lad is jumping around—keeps
an eye on us in the bargain, as if it mattered
a lick whether we did get going before
he was ready to follow suit. Some folks never
do like anybody to show ’em their dust, even
when it don’t matter a pinch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then Jack waved his hand toward the two
hostlers whom he had generously tipped, and
pulled the gun in his accustomed careful fashion;
after which they started along the level
field for the takeoff, there being small necessity
for a runway on such a generous fairway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Faster and faster they flew along the ground,
and then with their wheels parting contact with
the earth up they started at an easy incline.
The roar of the motor already drowned most of
the clamor from the surging crowd, while the
racket of the whizzing propeller added to the
chorus so joyous to the ears of all real air pilots,
since nothing pleases them more than to feel they
are masters of a ship that is in “apple-pie” condition
for battling whatever lies ahead, be it
storm, fog or whatnot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Somehow Perk was twisting his head around
as if curious to ascertain whether that Ryan
crate had succeeded in imitating their example,
and was already making the preliminary dash
across the field—which luckily enough had
chanced to be fairly clear of maneuvering
planes, either descending, taking off, or being
taxied into position for the next stunt on the
program.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was getting well along by this
time, and already the first dim shadows of approaching
night were to be seen slipping
out from certain patches of pine trees ahead.
But the higher they climbed, now that a start
had been accomplished, the lighter it would become,
what with a lower horizon, and the sun
still hanging in plain sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once free from any possibility of any contact
with the wheeling and ducking planes—some of
which were doing the barrel roll, and others
making successive somersaults, with the daring
pilots proceeding while in an inverted position—Jack
could start spiraling, and climbing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rapidly was Candler Field fading from view
behind them since Jack had swung toward the
south, as if to lay his course directly for New
Orleans. Perk seemed to find a subtle attraction
back where they had just come from, since he
was again turning his head with nothing else to
do save gratify his innocent curiosity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! ’pears like they might be meaning to
strike for the Louisiana canebrake country, and
black bear diggings, just like I said,” he was
telling himself, with a chuckle of amusement
over his shrewd guess. “And say, that little
Ryan crate’s no slouch ’bout making speed, I’d
mention. Come along you sportin’ crowd—plenty
of room in the ceiling overhead, an’ nixey
a chance to bring about a collision. Take your
choice, and cut out for all you’re worth, boys.
If you get there before we do, just tell ’em we’re
acomin’ too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk continued to amuse himself in watching
the antics of the rival ship, and indulging in
all kinds of wild speculations as to what the real
object of those two sporty looking occupants
might prove to be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently thus far not the slightest suspicion
had entered his mind that the taking to the air
of the shining Ryan boat had the first thing to
do with their own skipping out, and heading
toward the Crescent City.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like as not when it gets real dark after a
bit,” Perk continued to say, being addicted to
talking to himself more or less, “we’ll soon lose
her, and have the field all to ourselves. Only
moving thing I c’n sight back there, ’cept them
circlin’ buzzards huntin’ for a carrion supper.
Guess everything’s going along first class
and we’re in for a comfortable night run down
over the corn and sugarcane country. This is
the life for little Perk, you hear me saying,
everybody—it’s got the boxin’ game, and even
that outdoor life up with the Mounties in Canada,
beat to a frazzle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk busied himself with his duties for
some time, and presently became aware of the
fact that evening was actually at hand; for the
sun had dropped out of sight over in the far
west, and looking down he found it absolutely
impossible to distinguish what lay beneath them
some two thousand feet more or less earthward—there
might be forests, farms, hills or swales
following each other in rapid succession; but all
masked by the sable curtains of night. When
the moon rose later on, its light would not afford
them any opportunity for marking any peculiarities
of the ground down there, since it must
simply present the appearance of a swiftly moving
panorama.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, moved once more by his old curiosity
concerning the ship that had started off immediately
after their own jump, again twisted his
head so as to take another backward look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hanged if she ain’t keeping on our tail right
along,” he told himself, as if a bit surprised,
though not in the least troubled, since there
could be no possible connection between this
Ryan monoplane and their own old bus, bent
on reeling off so many miles per hour, and aiming
to make the airport at New Orleans by early
dawn or before, according to how the weather
treated them, and the speed Jack could coax
from his aerial steed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Further inspection convinced Perk that the
rival ship was neither gaining nor losing as the
two sped along their way; a fact that began to
make him “sit up and take notice,” and then
express himself confidentially:</p>

<p class='c013'>“By jinks! it looks to me like that clever little
Ryan bus could make circles around our tub
’less Jack c’n squeeze a lot more snap from our
Whirlwind motor. Now what game c’n that
pair of sports be playin’ right now, I want to
know—must be they’re so used to bettin’ on
anything an’ everything they’re meanin’ to keep
right on our tail all night long, just to make us
hump along, and get the laugh on us poor
guys.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c014'>CHAPTER IV <br /> <br />THE GRIM PURSUER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>As the minutes crept along Perk’s uneasiness
commenced to make itself more manifest, finally
reaching such a condition that he felt it would
ease his mind if only he could get the opinion
of his companion on the subject.</p>

<p class='c013'>To do this it would be necessary that they
should make use of the head earphones that had
been taken along for this particular purpose.
Accordingly he quickly adjusted his own, and
then proceeded to advise Jack as to what he
wished to do. Since these useful adjuncts of the
pilot’s outfit were so arranged that they could
be slipped on and off with little loss of time,
it was an easy matter for Perk to apply them,
after which he went on to speak.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, seems like that pesky little Ryan insect’s
been tailing us right along, though mebbe
now you didn’t notice it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know it, Perk—fact is I proved that fact
to my own satisfaction, for twice now I’ve
changed our course, once into the west, and
again heading into the southwest, even if it
didn’t catch your attention.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You did that same; and say, what happened,
Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a blessed thing,” came the immediate
answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They still hung on our tail, do you mean,
old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like they did—queer how two pilots,
strangers both, would take a notion to change
their course, not once but twice running,” commented
Jack in his non-committal fashion that
always had Perk guessing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Strikes me as something more than a happy
chance,” asserted Perk, beginning to throw off
that comfortable feeling with which he had
wrapped himself as he contemplated a steady
going night run, with never a reason for anything
gripping them by way of excitement;
“ev’ry little movement of that Ryan two-seater’s
got a meanin’ of its own. Now what ails the
ducks I want to know—how c’n our movements
have a mite to do with what they’re planning
to carry out—got any idea along them lines, old
hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing definite as yet,” answered Jack; “I
was starting to figure it out just when you barged
in, and opened this talk fest up with your question.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, come to think of it, what did you make
out of that stiff yarn Scotty put over on us a
while ago?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was raw stuff for a fact; but I don’t question
anything he told us, remember, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whoever his mysterious visitor was he must
have been hunting for something, that’s dead
sure!” declared Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Something he didn’t find, either,” continued
Jack’s assistant pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Scotty was ready to swear to that fact, and
he ought to know.” Jack countered by saying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“But see here, old hoss, you’ve got some sorter
idea what the game might abeen, haven’t you
for a fact?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon I know why the sneak thief failed
to carry away the thing he was looking for, if
that’s what you mean, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As what, boss—I’m all worked up wantin’
to know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perhaps the reason might have been because
the object of his search happened at that very
time to be safe and snug in the inside pocket
of this same coat I’m wearing under my overalls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At hearing this startling announcement Perk
gave a quick look into his pal’s face, there being
just enough light remaining in the western sky
to allow this searching glance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! now I’m beginning to get somewhere,
and ready to quit this gropin’ around,
like a man in a London fog—that letter you had
this very morning from Headquarters—somehow
’r other some of the gang had wind of your
gettin’ it, and they guessed it’d be kept
safe under lock and key in your room at the
hotel; and then they got balled up about the
number on the door, so they broke into the wrong
room. Jack, am I on the right track?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems that’s so, according to my notion,
Perk; unless I miss my guess that’s the way
things stand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A disgusted grunt from Perk told that he did
not feel very happy over certain facts in the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gosh-a-mighty!” he burst out, explosively,
“if that’s right, then the tricky crowd know you’n
me are on this case—that even right now we’re
starting out to pluck their tail feathers, and
fetch that master-crook to the bar!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! I expected that would happen,” said
Jack, indifferently. “Having been told by several
of the best men in the service that Slim was
the smartest all-round dopester known in all the
land, I anticipated that he’d have means for
finding out that fact long ago—that there might
be a leak around Headquarters; for spies can
worm in almost anywhere, given an opportunity,
and the backing of a big bunch of jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yet that fact don’t seem to rattle you worth
a red cent, old hoss,” continued the puzzled
Perk, who ofttimes found the actions of his cool
partner a mystery he could not solve, because of
his own more impetuous ways.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope not,” was all Jack said in reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thunder and lightning!” ejaculated the co-pilot,
as if an illuminating idea had suddenly
flashed through his brain—“that Ryan bus,
Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what of it?” demanded the one at the
stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What if that sporty guy I told you about
should turn out to be the critter who broke into
Scotty’s room, and made it a complete wreck?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It could happen that way, Perk; seems like
you’re working on a warm scent right now. Pity
we didn’t get a good look at the gentleman before
he hid his face behind that helmet and goggles;
then at least we’d know him if ever we happened
to run across his trail.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The other was almost frothing at the mouth
through disgust and anger combined; but he
managed to say, with a select few hard words
interlarded as a vent to his outraged feelings:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Give me half a chance and I’ll mark him so
there’s be no difficulty in locating the sneak when
we meet him again—I’d put a bit of lead
through his arm that’d keep him out of the scrap
for a week of Sundays; or else clip off one of
his ears, to stamp him as a low-down crook.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack knew full well that this was no idle threat
on the part of his running mate; for Perk had a
reputation as a pistol shot second to none in the
entire service, being a natural born marksman.</p>

<p class='c013'>He lapsed into a spell of silence after making
that vicious remark; but from the way he
glanced back again and again it looked as
though Perk meant to keep close tabs on the
craft that was dogging their own ship so
steadily.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were roaring on their way, and it would
seem as if they must be showing a clean pair of
heels to anything in their rear; but just the same,
Perk, with the vision of an air-minded individual,
could readily understand how the speedy
Ryan plane was slowly but insidiously picking
up on them continuously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blamed nuisance,” he was muttering to himself
when this important fact became a positive
truth; “guess now that rip-snorter could make
circles round us, if so be he wanted to. Shucks!
what’s left to us I want to know; an’ just what
does he ’spect to accomplish with all this chasin’
us? Might as well get out my little old
six-shot bear gun, so’s to be ready in case
there’s any sort o’ ruction aheadin’ our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The idea seemed to afford him a strange sort
of grim satisfaction, for bending down he ran
his hand under the coaming of the cockpit; to
almost immediately withdraw a very decent
looking sporting repeating rifle, evidently his
working tool whenever he felt disposed to spend
a week in the wilds, either alone, or with some
boon companions also yearning for wild game
and the much desired campfire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold tight, Perk,” Jack was saying just
then; “going into a nose dive, and see if that
will upset his calculations; for he’s got me buffaloed
all right as to what’s in the wind!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Almost immediately they turned the nose of
their craft earthward, and went down on a
swift slant. Perk kept his head turned even as
this maneuvre was being executed, and what he
saw was something calculated to almost take
his breath away; for where the pursuing Ryan
ship loomed up as a shadowy form, vivid
splashes, as of fire, were coming in quick succession—he
could even imagine he heard the pulsating
staccato reports following each other in
succession, just as in those never-to-be-forgotten
days when he would have a covey of
devil-may-care German air fighters stepping on
the tail of his old-fashioned boat, and peppering
him from their rapid-firing guns!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c014'>CHAPTER V <br /> <br />THE DUEL IN THE AIR</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The significant flashes abruptly ceased; but
Perk realized this was only because the expert
pilot handling that same Ryan wasp was also
ducking down in an exact copy of their own
game.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the moment Perk lost sight of the shadowy
pursuing craft; then Jack changed his tactics,
and once again brought his boat on an even
keel. Perk strained his eyesight in an endeavor
to pick up the other ship after it too had swung
into a direct course.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Devil take that guy at the stick,” he stormed
to himself, although Jack caught almost every
word, since the earphones were still in operation,
“he’s seen our move, an’ gone us one better.
No slouch o’ a pilot, either, I’ll admit. When
that gent who goes by the name o’ Slippery Slim
picks his gang he knows how to pull trumps
out of the pack all right. Give him another
shoot, Jack, old hoss; mebbe he wont be so lucky
next time. He’s got some kind o’ a rapid-fire
shooter aboard, and had started to send a hail
o’ lead ’bout our ears just as you turned the trick
on him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was apparently quite willing to give a
repeat, for hardly had the other ceased shouting
than they again shot down in a dizzy dive
that seemed likely to lower their altitude by
something like five hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was keeping a close watch, and knew
that once more the grim pursuer had copied
their daring maneuvre.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s a good one, or I’ll eat my hat!” he burst
out, as they were “cutting a blue streak” once
more through the growing darkness, and he
could see those suggestive flashes again punctuating
the gloom in their track. “Jack, he’s
started that racket again, don’t you know; and
any second we may get a slug in our belly, bustin’
things all to flinders. Try a razzle-dazzle on
the boob, old broncho!”</p>

<p class='c013'>So making a bank, Jack changed his course,
running at right angles, and if anything at a
faster pace than ever. Perk had the situation
“sized up to a fraction,” as he himself would
have called it; he realized that it was only
through the greatest of good luck they had escaped
being hit by one of those flying missiles;
and that so long as the mysterious enemy kept
using their ship for a flying target they were in
constant peril. Despite all this ducking and
dodging on Jack’s part he did not seem successful
in throwing the pursuing craft off the track.
To be sure the darkness was gradually growing
thicker with every passing minute, and this
seemed to be their only hope of crawling out of
a “hot hole,” according to Perk’s calculations.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk afterwards frankly admitted that he was
frothing at the mouth on account of finding himself
up against a situation where the cards
seemed stacked against him—where his hands
were tied as it were, and that reckless pilot, chasing
after them hell-bent, held all the trumps.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No use tryin’ that game any longer, Jack,
boy!” he yelled suddenly. “See the glim all
’round us, partner—sure as you live they’ve
even got some kind o’ a searchlight aboard, just
like they’d planned all this thing out beforehand.
Guess now it’s up to Little Perk to put
a plug into their game. Hold her steady a bit,
boss; I’m meaning to make ’em sit up an’ take
notice they can’t hog <i>all</i> the fun going. Watch
my smoke, Jack, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a delicate situation without any doubt;
for if those aboard that little Ryan plane, taking
advantage of the halo of light covering the craft
they followed, continued to make use of their
rapidfire gun, the danger of a hit had vastly increased;
but Perk must have some sort of scheme
in mind it was evident, or he would never have
asked his chum to steady the badly wobbling
boat when such action only doubled their peril.</p>

<p class='c013'>Calmly and deliberately, as though simply
bent on fetching down a deer he wanted for
his next camp supper, steady old Perk had his
faithful gun up to his shoulder, and was sighting
that piercing glare of light that marked the bow
of the pursuing aircraft, betraying the presence
of a searchlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Possibly owing to the clamor of their own
working motor Jack could not tell when his
companion unloosed a fusilade of shots; but he
did know that something suddenly changed the
situation, and to their advantage; for as though
a blanket had been tossed over the piercing
ray the illumination abruptly ceased, leaving
them to continue their wild flight shrouded in
encompassing darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, too, the sound of Perk’s exulting yell
was quite enough to tell the story of his success
in finding a glowing target for one of his several
missiles—the old sharpshooter had evidently
lost none of his cunning by reason of a lapse in
action.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Set ’em up in the other alley, boys—give your
Dutch uncle a chance to show an old trick or
two! Now <i>will</i> you be good, or must I give
you another smash in the jaw—better haul off
while the haulin’s good, fellers—I’d sure hate to
make you crack up, and fade out!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Even though his clever shot had doubtless
utterly smashed the searchlight, and put it out
of business, that bothersome rapidfire gun was
still in working order, as Perk discovered when
once more those insistent flashes, following closely
upon each others’ heels, announced a fresh
barrage, with the unseen, unheard hissing bullets
doubtless whizzing all around them.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was adding insult to injury, Perk was
doubtless telling himself, as he realized that his
lucky shot had after all failed to daunt that
stubborn pair in the speedy Ryan ship.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You <i>will</i> have it, seems like,” he growled
to himself; for since he had discarded his earphone
harness just previous to starting his late
“shooting spree,” Perk could no longer hold
intercourse with his fellow flyer; “all right then,
I’ll try some more o’ the same sorter medicine;
what’s good for the goose orter be fine for the
gander. Mind your eye now, boys, and keep
a tight grip on your chutes if anything happens
not down in your gamble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again did the continual flash of spitting fire
from the gun afford the sharpshooter in the
chased ship abundant opportunities for focussing
his aim; although instinct may have
taken the place of vision on Perk’s part.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fortunately Jack must have been expecting
something along those lines, knowing his companion
so well, and how he was always eager
to “repeat” when things were coming his way;
for he kept the flying boat wonderfully steady
just then, even though realizing how such action
doubled their own chances of being hit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was now shooting on general principles,
in hopes of being fortunate enough to find a
billet for one of his random bullets. He went
at the business with all the <i>sang froid</i> of a veteran
fighter, accustomed to meeting hostile
craft up in the wide air spaces, or even above
the clouds—all the fierce delight of matching
his skill and life against a foeman worthy of his
steel had once more gripped the old flying warrior;
and it may be for the moment he deluded
himself with the belief that this was but a reincarnation
of those never-to-be-forgotten days
when all Europe was held fast in the throes of
the grisly war-god.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly Perk ceased firing, nor was this
caused by the magazine of his repeating rifle
being empty—he had seen that the discharges
back yonder were no longer in full blast, showing
that something must have happened to cause
such a sudden cessation to hostilities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before he could attempt to analyze what this
might mean it was all flashed before his questioning
mind—a burst of flames came from the
spot where last he had seen the shadowy shape
of their persistent pursuer clipping through
space like a blazing meteor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk sat there doubled up, his mouth half
open, staring with might and main, as some
object began to drop toward the earth with ever
increasing speed—something which he knew
full well must of necessity be the beautiful little
Ryan plane, which he had admired so much
when at Candler Field at close of the late day,
and before this wild dash into the darkness of
night began.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently one of his missiles (fired with such
grim determination when he “took the bit in
his teeth,” and struck back) had found its mark,
and unleashed the dangerous contents of the
gasoline reservoir, with the splashing fluid instantly
catching fire from the exploding spark
of the running motor.</p>

<p class='c013'>No flyer ever saw his enemy going down in a
flaming coffin without feeling compassion gripping
him; that one moment had changed his
heart from bitter hatred to a sense of pity; knowing
as he must have done that the day might
be near at hand when he too would share in a
similar dreadful fate.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so Perk found himself all in a nervous
tremble as, laying down his gun, he managed
once more to adjust the head harness, so as to
be able to again hold communication with his
fellow adventurer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c014'>CHAPTER VI <br /> <br />PARACHUTE JUMPERS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Just then Jack hurriedly banked, and swung
around as though to double back on their late
course. This of course told Perk the pilot must
be already aware of the terrible tragedy that
was being enacted close at hand, and meant to
see its finish with his own eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the abrupt change in their course he
was in time to catch a glimpse of the flaming
object still spiraling earthwards, a billow of fire
that glowed suggestively in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then far below it seemed to strike the ground—they
heard no sound whatever, but the fire
became stationary; although increasing in fury,
since the wind created by its passage no longer
whipped the devouring flames. Evidently by
the time the conflagration stopped for want of
further material on which to feed, nothing inflammable
would be left of the once haughty
little Ryan masterpiece save the engine, and
other metal parts.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the big idea, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk asked this as a leader, wishing to get a
better grip on his own nerves, since they had
been dreadfully shocked at the dire result of his
random shot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Going to circle around a few times, and drop
down a bit,” came the illuminating reply;
“though I reckon it’s no use, since nothing could
live in all that awful blast.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe not, Jack,” remarked Perk, a bit
cheerily; “but there’s a fair chance neither o’
them guys got snagged in the flash o’ that gas.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Perk, have you some foundation
for saying that?” demanded the other, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure—they jumped all right, boss,” Perk
told him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You saw them do it then, did you, boy?”
continued Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They bailed out okay—I saw two take the
jump right after the first flash came—went down
like plummets in the bargain—smart lads those
guys are, I’m tellin’ you, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>No doubt Jack was glad to hear this bit of
news, for it had filled him with horror to realize
that in order to escape they had been compelled
to ruthlessly take human life. He was
much younger than Perk, veteran of the World
War, who had grown more or less hardened
to such happenings when staking his own life
against that of a tricky German air pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Still goin’ down, are you?” asked Perk shortly
afterwards, on finding that they were still
swinging around in a wide circle, that burning
pyre far below being the hub of the wheel of
which their boat was the outer tire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Might as well,” came the ready answer,
showing that Jack had made up his mind
hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess now they’ll get down somehow, boss;
a whole lot depends on what kind o’ landin’
they’ll be able to make—if its rocks, or trees,
they got to strike it’s apt to be some hard sleddin’
for the boys. Say, ’taint possible now you’re
fixin’ to try an’ lend ’em a helpin’ hand? I’d
hate to know they’d been wiped off the map in
that hot fire; but somehow I don’t feel like
playin’ the part o’ the Good Samaritan to such
man devils as them two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No danger of my trying to make a landing
where the chances are ten to one it just <i>can’t</i> be
done,” explained Jack, seeing that his companion
was almost ready to mutiny if any such mad
proceeding were contemplated. “I’d just feel
better if I knew they’d reached ground okay;
then we could keep on our way, and it’d be up
to them to get out of the scrape.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! I get you, partner,” grunted the relieved
Perk. “Don’t think I’m bitter about the
thing, ’cause they’re sure hot stuff all right; but
I’m a bit slow to accept that forgive and forget
stuff, specially after any guy’s tried his level
best to gimme a dirty deal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll try the thing out while on the job,”
Jack announced. “Our own wonderful escape
from meeting just that same kind of fate makes
me kind of soft. Perhaps we’ll not be able to
learn a single thing; you know how it often is
when you’ve finally struck ground after quitting
the ship by the chute route—all out of breath—sometimes
knocked up a bit, if you escape broken
bones—not any shape to shout, or do anything
but just lie there, and suck in the air in big
gasps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, that’s right for you, old hoss,” Perk
readily agreed. “Me, I once got a collar bone
smashed that way. No harm in our makin’ a
few swings around these diggin’s ’fore we put
out for Orleans. That fire keeps burnin’ like
things they got sprinkled right well with the
juice when the tank blew up. Go to it, Jack,
just as you please, never mindin’ a few squeals
from a hard-boiled guy like Perk Perkiser.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m going to shut down on the engine, and
take a little glide, so we can pick up anything
like a yell,” announced the pilot a minute later.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to it—duck then, boy!” snapped Perk,
as he temporarily relieved himself of his ear-phones
in order to catch anything bordering on
a shout from the ground below.</p>

<p class='c013'>The simple expedient was carried out successfully,
and when once again they leveled out,
to continue circling, Jack asked eagerly:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get anything, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a bleat, partner,” replied the other, who
had hurriedly held his earphones in position so
as to cover the emergency.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sorry for that, but we’ll try a couple more
times before calling it all off,” suggested Jack,
who could be more or less persistent when the
occasion arose for such action, though never
carrying it so far as to be reckless.</p>

<p class='c013'>So a dozen seconds or so afterwards he again
gave warning that it was time for another drop
of a few hundred feet—not that they meant to
take any chances by getting too close to the unknown
terrain lying in the pitch blackness under
the flying ship; but simply to be able to listen
with the horrid clamor of the bustling engine
momentarily stilled.</p>

<p class='c013'>No better success followed this second maneuvre—all
was deathly silent around, above,
below, as though never a solitary living human
being existed within miles of the spot where
the destruction of the Ryan monoplane had
taken place.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll give a third and last try,” was Jack’s
announced decision, to which Perk added:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Three times, and batter’s out—by then I rather
guess we’ll be down close enough to the solid
ground to make another drop dangerous. Either
way I’m satisfied we’ve done the right thing,
old hoss. Suit yourself when you see fit to
coast,” whereupon he once more denuded his
ears of the exceedingly useful and really indispensable
phone harness, to await the occasion
of the last try in the line of an aviator’s
duty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it, Perk?—get a whisper?”</p>

<p class='c013'>They had completed the glide, and were once
more on a level course, with Jack even turning
the nose of the ship a bit heavenward; since
neither of them knew what the nature of the
ground below must be—whether some hill lay
directly ahead, against which they might smash
for a complete wipeout.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! a heap more’n that, partner!” came
the triumphant reply. “Heard a shout, an’ then
another some distance off—struck me both
jumpers had lit okay, and were tryin’ to communicate,
so’s to get together again. Guess
things ain’t so bad after all with them guys, an’
we c’n be movin’ on our way without botherin’
any more ’bout their safety. Some two-legged
varmints seem to be watched over by Old Satan
hisself, they bein’ that venomous, and evil-minded.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack made no rejoinder to this remark, tinged
with bitterness as it was, only pointed the nose
of his craft upward, and started to spiral for
altitude. Undoubtedly he was feeling greatly
relieved because of their having escaped so
miraculously from the hovering peril; and best
of all managed to turn the tables on those who
would have encompassed their destruction just
in order to defend the lawless game in which
they were engaged in connection with Slippery
Slim.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk must have been doing a little hard thinking
as the time passed and they raced on their
way, for later on he started to speak; and as
usual his line of chatter told that he was seeking
information, trying to find a solution of
certain exasperating puzzles that were “twisting
his intellects,” as he himself described
matters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Things kind o’ got me goofy, partner, an’
I’d like you to raise the curtain some, if so be
you feel so bent. First place I guess it goes
without questionin’ that these huskies must be
in cohunks with that there big gun, Slippery
Slim Garrabrant?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! that’s a dead certainty—who else would
have any reason for waylaying us in Atlanta,
and setting up this trap for us to fall into?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! then it stands to reason, boss, he’s
got means for findin’ out what the Secret Service
aims to do; an’ so has been able to play the boys
for suckers every time they set out to lay him
by the heels, eh, Jack, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s past history, Perk; even the Big Boss
got wise to it, and tried everything possible to
learn where the great leak happened; but our
experience proves they haven’t discovered it so
far. I’m making up my mind that the closer
we draw to the headquarters of this rotten clique
of crime, where they make the bogus long-green
that’s been flooding the whole West for a year
and more, why, the harder our job is bound
to be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which tickles me a heap, boy—I’m just
yearnin’ for comin’ to grips with that gazaboo
o’ a Slim; and now we’re on to the job I’ll never
be happy ’till he’s on his way to that big Government
pen we glimpsed in Atlanta, where
some other lads we helped to pinch are doin’
time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if you keep on as you’ve started, Perk,
we’ll flatten the whole gang like pancakes—they’ve
stacked up against a new sort of revenue
dog when they started a shooter of your calibre
on the trail. First you smashed their searchlight,
and then sent a chuck of lead into the
gas tank that broke up the game. That’s the
kind of a pinch hitter you are, partner; and
right now I want to congratulate you on such
dandy marksmanship.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lay off that stuff, Jack—nothin’ but great
luck fetched the bacon home for this lad. But
me, I’m shakin’ hands with myself ’cause I
had that hunch a bear gun mightn’t be such a
bad thing to tote along on a trip that’s goin’ to
carry us across the border, an’ into Old Mex,
like as not; where the greasers are sometimes
tough nuts an’ hard to handle they tell me.
’Spose we’ll run across them two hill billies
again, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wouldn’t surprise me a bit if we did,” replied
the pilot, leveling off at a three thousand
foot ceiling, and still heading due southwest.
“Like as not they’ve got plenty of ready cash
along; and after having been so cleverly upset in
their calculations, due to your beating them silly
with a barrage of hot lead, they’ll be hot to wipe
out their disgrace. Oh! yes, we’re going to run
up against that foxey pair again before the book
is closed for keeps.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c014'>CHAPTER VII <br /> <br />STRIKING THE FOG BELT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>With the stars shining brightly above them,
and a moon just past its full climbing the eastern
heavens, having dissipated the darkness of the
earlier part of the night, Jack and his fellow
voyager continued plunging along in a very
satisfactory fashion, having no reason for feeling
further concern regarding the peril to
which they had been so lately subjected.</p>

<p class='c013'>But things were not destined to continue so
comfortably for the two adventurers, it seemed.
Perk was just congratulating himself for about
the fourth time at having such a comfortable
flight, when he sat up and took notice of the
fact that those heavenly bodies were beginning
to look exceedingly hazy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Danged shame, that’s what, to spoil such a
dandy night!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What ails you now?” demanded Jack, on
hearing the other make this little remark that
bespoke exasperation at least; “another boat on
our tail?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I guess not just now,” replied Perk,
scoffingly; “one was more’n enough for a single
jump. But we’re agoin’ to run into a pesky
fog belt, sure as you’re born, old hoss!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That all?” laughed the other, who apparently
saw nothing of particular consequence
about such a common happening; “it may perhaps
manage to slow us down more or less; but
what does that matter, when we’ve got time to
burn. The Big Boss told us, remember, not to
hurry things at all—plenty of time, oodles of
money, and any backing we chose to call for in
the way of a new boat, or more helpers. We
should worry, old scout!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Tain’t that in peticular Jack,” complained
the other; “but of all things a sky detective’s got
to run smack up against, fog’s the one I despise
most. It’s got me in bad more’n a few times, so
I’ve grown to look on the peasoup stuff like it
was my—er, what-dye-call it—Nebraska, no, I
mean Nemesis.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, now you mention it, Perk, I remember
you telling me something about that strange feeling
you have creep over you. No need for you
to apologize—in my knocking around among airmen
I’ve found that often even the most daring
and reckless in the bunch had some kind of a
weakness, if only you looked far enough under
the surface; just as sometimes you’ll find a boasting
bully actually afraid of his little wife at
home, who’s smacked him with her handy rolling
pin many a time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! wasn’t I a canvas man ’long with a
travelin’ circus a wheen o’ years ago, an’ didn’t
I see the biggest elephant in captivity rear up
on his hind legs, lift his trunk sky-high in the
air, an’ squeal like fun just when a little half
grown mouse happened to run along near his
alley. Well, I’m the tusker, an’ fog is the
mouse, as you might say—we never do get on
well as a combine. Hope it hugs the ground,
an’ leaves us a clear track up among the clouds
I c’n see creepin’ up ahead yonder.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Doesn’t bother me a whit, partner; don’t
forget we’ve got that new radio beacon aboard
to try out; and if it’s as clever as I’ve heard tell
it’ll carry us along our route to Orleans through
the thickest nest of fog anybody ever stacked up
against. Naturally we can’t expect to get the
full benefit of its capacity to hold a speeding
plane on its true course; because the invention’s
hardly more than half baked up to now; but I
set it according to directions, and if at any time
we begin to slide off our course the light that
springs up is bound to give warning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A bully good layout I’d say, if it c’n do what
they claim,” ventured Perk, who undoubtedly
had read certain things concerning the new invention,
and was eager to learn just how it would
pan out. “You showed a level head, partner,
when you decided to take the offer o’ that gent
in Atlanta, and try the thing out. Guess, then,
I needn’t bother my head ’bout gettin’ astray;
if things keep bein’ invented it ain’t goin’ to be
very long till a pilot’ll get slapped good an’
hard if he misses runnin’ on a straight line, or
even veers from his proper course in a great big
blow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re living in a machine age, Perk, and
every day things are heading that way on the
run—electric helps in kitchen, factory, and even
aboard our air cruisers. While the brainwork
and strain grow harder the actual manual labor
is lessened all the time. But as you say it’s getting
a bit hazy, and chances are we’re in for a
spell of blue fog.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Ten minutes afterwards there could not be
the least doubt concerning that fact, for by degrees
even the stars vanished from view, ditto
the gorgeous round moon. Still, since the sky
remained brighter in the east, it was not at all
difficult to tell where the fair mistress of the
Southern night had hidden her face behind the
opaque veil.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was now flying by instruments alone,
since never a thing could be seen by the keenest
eye above, below—they seemed to be hung in
unlimited space; but pushing along with considerable
speed just the same, bound for the distant
city on the vast Mississippi, situated not so
very far from its delta.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus passed a full hour.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly Perk saw a small light spring into
view on one side of the plane, and it certainly
electrified him considerably.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hi! there, partner, we’re off our track—shifted
to the east, seems like, unless I’m away
wrong in sizin’ things up ’cordin’ to Hoyle.
Got to swing her to the larboard-watch side, I
kinder guess—how ’bout that, boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You hit it that time, Perk, and here she goes
to climb back to our true course. Worked just
as we figured it would, and put us wise to a fact
we’d hardly have picked up in any other way.
I reckon now this same radio beacon’s bound to
turn out a great help to the poor badgered air
pilot, flying blind when fog hides the ground
beacons, and he gets no aid from the heavens
above.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll say it’s the best thing I’ve struck for a
long time,” affirmed the delighted Perk.
“There she goes—the glim I mean—closed shop,
havin’ ’complished the business set for her;
showing we must have struck our real course
again.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Easy money,” laughed Jack, just as well satisfied.
“Makes a fellow sit up and try to guess
what the next big idea connected with aviation
will prove to be; doesn’t seem to be any limit to
the dazzling discoveries these scientific chaps’ll
turn out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, partner—like that big chute they’re
trying out, which they claim will keep any
plane from crashing—if the engine goes dead
all you got to do is to press a little button, and
when the drop comes open goes the monster umbrella,
able to hold you and the crate suspended
in the air, to gradually fall to the earth like the
colored balls from a bursted skyrocket. Great
stunt that, an’ I’m livin’ in hopes it’ll be my
luck to some day find myself aboard a ship that’s
equipped with such a giant chute, an’ have the
glorious experience of seeing the thing work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack seemed to consider it the part of wisdom
to pull up more or less, as they were in no hurry,
and could drop down on the aviation field at
New Orleans by dawn, even though they concluded
to just “loaf along.” Disliking anything
pertaining to fog Perk naturally said nothing
to hint at a desire for further speed; besides
his own good sense told him that what his mate
had just said with regard to no necessity existing
for haste, was sound logic, and a due regard
for “safety first.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So the time slipped away, with midnight finding
them past the meridian of their projected
flight. Perk had long since subsided and
seemed content to sit there in the double cockpit,
letting his thoughts roam back to the exciting
developments of the earlier night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Years had elapsed since last he watched a
doomed plane writhing and twisting in its death
agonies, with the flames wrapping it in an envelope—a
blazing coffin speeding headlong to a
final crash; and here, strange to say, after all
that time intervening he had again passed
through a similar experience. Now that he had
an opportunity to calmly review the happening,
Perk admitted he was pleased to know the two
occupants of the Ryan cockpit had apparently
escaped a miserable fate that must have been
laid at his door.</p>

<p class='c013'>Two A. M. and all’s well!</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk figured that when a few more times
sixty minutes had passed it would be time for
them to catch a first glimpse of the great rolling
turgid stream that could, when the heavy rains
united with the melting snows up in the mountains
of the Far West, create vast floods that
placed much of the low country along the river
under many feet of water. It had been a long
time since last Perk had set eyes on the Mississippi,
and hence he was considerably worked
up over the prospect of soon glimpsing the
mighty flood.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c014'>CHAPTER VIII <br /> <br />NEW ORLEANS—FIRST STOP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“There she rolls, Jack, old boy—the greatest
stream in the whole U.S.A.—I swan if she
don’t look just as fine as when I glimpsed her
for the first time many years ago!”</p>

<p class='c013'>That was Perk’s tribute on beholding the
Lower Mississippi perhaps thirty miles above
New Orleans; he displayed almost as much enthusiasm
as those early discoverers did centuries
back, when their distended eyes took in the
mighty sweep of the flood rolling down toward
its junction with the Mexican Gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was early dawn, and the fog bank had been
dissipated by a fresh breeze acting as advance
courier to the rising of the sun. Jack, looking
toward the southwest could also see the object
of his companion’s exultation, and undoubtedly
felt some of the same pleasure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When it gets a bit lighter we’ll have a far distant
view of the city, with its smoke cloud hovering
over it,” he remarked, knowing that soft coal
and southern pine as used for fuel in the Fall
and Winter seasons always caused something of
a pall to mark the site of the river metropolis.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk reached around, and drew forth a case
that on being opened disclosed a pair of pretty
decent binoculars, with which they had been
fitted out by the Washington authorities before
starting on this particular man-hunt, with an
idea that they might prove most useful sooner
or later.</p>

<p class='c013'>After clapping these to his eyes Perk announced
that he could easily pick up the goal
of their flight from Candler Field; although the
smoke did act as a screen, through which it was
not possible to see with certainty.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was now bringing out all the reserve
speed of their ship—it was of some consequence
that they make a landing as early as possible,
since he had no desire to attract undue attention,
and possibly have inquisitive newspaper reporters
to be asking pertinent questions as to
whence they came, what their identities might
be when at home, and also concerning the object
of their coming to New Orleans. Secrecy
was the foundation on which they meant to
build their plans; and from their previous experience
with those dare devils in the employ of
Slippery Slim, too much care could not be employed
in order to mask their batteries.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, too, as they approached the city Jack was
dropping down to lower levels; while on his part
Perk skimmed the whole scene, looking for the
airport they knew to be somewhere within reach
of their vision.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being presently located he called his
chum’s attention to the open field, and in almost
no time they were circling it, looking for the
best place to land.</p>

<p class='c013'>Early though it was there were moving figures
circulating around, while some sort of ship
was coming in from over the river—possibly one
of the air mail carriers from a distant station, it
might be many hundred miles away, fetching
Uncle Sam’s important letter sacks, and worthwhile
express matter, at treble the speed that the
fastest train could muster.</p>

<p class='c013'>The landing was effected without the slightest
difficulty, and hardly had their boat come
to a stop than a number of persons, most of them
connected with the ground force of mechanicians
and hostlers, surrounded the incoming
craft, paying but scant attention to the air mail,
which dropped down almost at the same moment—that
was a daily happening, a following
out of a regular schedule, to which they had
become accustomed; while the arrival of a mysterious
plane might stand for almost anything.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold fast, Perk!” said Jack, as he took off
his headphones, and raising his voice to almost
a shout, so deaf did he appear after a whole
night’s run; “don’t tumble out yet; and keep a
muffler on your gab, for we’ve got to let ’em
take it out in guessing. I’ll soon see if the
party we’re expecting to meet is on hand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He still kept his helmet and goggles in position
as he thrust his head out of the cockpit, and
raising his right hand with two fingers extended,
made a species of salute. A stout man,
with a very red face, and an air of importance,
immediately pushed through the gathering
crowd, and answered Jack’s signal with a similar
sweep of his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s okay, Perk—that’s our party, and he’s
been watching for us, showing he had my wire
last evening. Get a move on, and we’ll soon be
doubling our legs under a breakfast table.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! but that will be a joy to me,
old hoss!” Perk exclaimed; “’cause I’m as
hungry as a wolf, an’ the smell o’ coffee is apt
to set me wild. Go to it, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was paying no attention to these vaporings,
since it was a common occurrence to have
old Perk declare the bottom of his stomach was
in danger of falling out—he had met the red-faced
gentleman and they were shaking hands
as they exchanged a few words.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all fixed, comrade,” he said to Perk over
his shoulder, mentioning no names lest suspicious
ears catch them, and thus have a clue as
to their identity; “we’ll get a few of these boys
to run our boat into a hangar close by, which is
waiting for us, and then cut out for the city—and grub.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This being speedily carried out, with the
doors fastened securely, and the two flyers began
to hastily divest themselves of their working
“duds.” Before ten minutes had passed
they were on their way in a taxi the gentleman
friend had brought out, with Jack and their
host talking at a great rate; while as for Perk
he was looking out, and finding more or less enjoyment
in seeing new and novel sights along
the road.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk having been well coached as to the
necessity for caution, made it a practice to snatch
an occasional glance in their rear, looking for
any signs to indicate that their car was being
trailed; but nothing at all suspicious came to
his attention.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meantime Jack had learned that their new
friend (whose name he already knew to be Mr.
Adkins) was connected with the Administration
forces of the United States District Attorney,
having offices in the Government building—that
he had been secretly advised of their coming
days before receiving Jack’s wire; and was
ready to give them all the information possible
concerning what had been learned in connection
with the wholesale operations of the man they
had been sent out to cage, so as to effectually
remove the greatest menace that had threatened
business men of the Southwest in a decade.</p>

<p class='c013'>In due time he would post them regarding
all these important facts; meanwhile they
could take things easy, for there was no hurry,
and the game was of too much importance to
allow lax methods. When they got good and
ready they could make a start, and after that
everything must depend on their ability to beat
Slippery Slim at his favorite game of “dog eat
dog.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He steered his guests to a certain restaurant
where he knew they could be well taken care
of, and which turned out to be close to the hotel
at which they booked under fictitious names.
Here Perk was given the privilege of ordering
just what he desired along the line of rashers of
bacon and fried eggs; cornbread with syrup;
several cups of coffee taken black; and to top off
with, a Havana cigar such as he was not accustomed
to smoking, being addicted to the more
friendly pipe habit.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no talk of shop while they partook
of breakfast; such business as they had to transact
was of too delicate a nature to be discussed
in a public place, where strangers would be
coming and going, and spying eyes might be on
them every minute of the time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Later they gathered in the room at the hotel
where, behind closed and locked doors they felt
free to confer in lowered tones.</p>

<p class='c013'>Much had to be told, and numerous thrilling
accounts brought out connected with adventures
experienced by other Secret Service men in their
efforts to round up the notorious gang—all of
which had resulted in absolute defeat for the
Government agents.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shrewd men some of these parties undoubtedly
were, with a record of numerous famous
cases successfully carried through; but somehow
when they found themselves up against
Slippery Slim Garrabrant they sooner or later
fell down on the job, and had to be recalled.</p>

<p class='c013'>In fact, it was disclosed to Jack and his pal,
two different agents were never again heard
from, after secret code messages had been received
from them to the effect that they were
even then getting very close to a great discovery
that must end in the arrest of the malefactor—a
dead silence that had never been broken
seemed to signify that they must have fallen into
some sort of fiendish trap, possibly meeting with
a gruesome fate that would be forever shrouded
in blank mystery.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins, watching closely as he narrated
these uncomfortable facts, was pleased to see
that neither of his interested auditors displayed
the least sign of being disturbed, showing that
they had long since discounted everything along
this line.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c014'>CHAPTER IX <br /> <br />COACHING PERK</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Of course it was in keeping with this exchange
of confidences that Jack should relate all that
had happened to them since their arrival in
Atlanta to secure the ship awaiting them, load
it to capacity for a long voyage, and finally start
off from Candler Field.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins listened eagerly to this modest
account of what had already happened to them
as a starter in the hunt they had undertaken;
and he was visibly thrilled at hearing of the
bitter night chase, the desperate tactics undertaken
by the pair of human wolves aboard the
Ryan monoplane; and particularly when Jack
finally described in vivid language the astounding
act of Perk in first shattering the bothersome
searchlight, to follow this with his lucky
random shot that bore into the gas tank of the
pursuing craft and brought about an explosion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Possibly the urbane gentleman had never in
all his life listened to so ghastly a true story as
the graphic one thus modestly related by one
of the two participants; looking at them, with
Jack so calm and modest, giving all the credit
to his grinning accomplice, he must have decided
in his astute mind that at last Slippery
Slim was going to have a pair of human bloodhounds
on his trail such as all his ingenuity and
vindictiveness combined could not throw into
the discard.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me have,” he went on to say to Jack, “as
good a description as possible of those same
bills your friend Scotty found in that pocketbook
dropped among his clothing by the unknown
party whom you believe was looking for
your letter of instructions from Washington.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When Jack complied with this request the
other nodded his head approvingly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question but what they were of the same
stripe as all the others that have been brought to
our attention,” he told Jack. “You must know
it’s been a mooted question as to whether the
plates from which these notes are being printed
in vast quantities (that make it a gold mine for
the gang) are counterfeits engraved by some
master in the art or stolen property, which have
somehow never been missed by the plant where
much of the printing is done for the Treasury
Department—the bills are so perfect that cashiers
and tellers are all at sea over the facts, so
that something of a near panic has resulted in
banking circles as a result of this unknown quantity.
Remember these are the old type of banknotes,
and not the new abbreviated form of currency,
so that it is more difficult to discover the
actual facts.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will all come out in the wash, sir,” remarked
Perk, sagaciously, with a sly wink at
his pal.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, Perk,” observed the gentlemanly official,
smilingly; “but I’m more concerned about
your plan of campaign than anything else right
now. During the time you stop over here in
Orleans I mean to keep you posted with regard
to any fresh news that comes in to Headquarters
for there is hardly a day when we do not learn
of additional discoveries connected with this deluge
of phony money that’s been dumped on the
whole Southwest by this hard working gang.
I am telling you everything that’s known or suspected,
so that you can figure out your best line
of action.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We understand that, Mr. Adkins,” said Jack,
nodding, “and you can rest assured we appreciate
your kindness more than I can tell you.
Before we jump off you will know what we’ve
decided to do, so as to pick up a warm trail;
and after that, sir, don’t be worried if you fail
to hear a single word from us for days, weeks,
or even months; but depend upon it we’ll be
working on the job every minute.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And never forget, I beg of you, that this
man is a devil for cruelty and craftiness—I’m
sure you’ll not delude yourselves that his arrest
will be an easy task; for as good men as were
ever on the roll of our Secret Service Department
have fallen down on the job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you again, sir, for your warning; but
we’re not meaning to feel anything like over-confidence,
so as to let the bars down. I understand
from my having been picked to take up
this case, that the knowledge of myself and my
assistant here along the line of aviation cut a big
figure in the appointment, since it has been
learned that Slim himself makes use of a flying
boat possibly to cross over from the wilds of
Mexico, it being suspected he has his plant
hidden away somewhere among the mountains,
where he doubtless keeps peace with the authorities
by paying tribute that insures his being left
undisturbed. We hope to change all that sooner
or later, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I admire your modesty, Jack,” continued the
Government official, who had warmed toward
the pair during the short time he had known
them, and seemed to take a personal interest in
their fortunes. “Remember to keep in touch
with Headquarters while in the city, so as to
notify me in case you need any assistance—I can
later on place a posse of oldtime Texas Rangers
at your service, if the occasion arises for a necessity
to show force—they are now working for
the Government as border patrols, and as you
can understand, are the same rough-riding, fearless
type that played such a leading figure in
the early history of the Lone Star State; for we
have authority that covers such matters. And
I’ll be one of the first to extend you my hearty
congratulations should you win out, and bring
in your man; as I’ve no doubt your good pal
here used to do when, as you’ve told me, he used
to work with the Canadian Mounted Police
force, in years gone by.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It won’t be our fault, sir, if we make a flop
o’ the job,” asserted Perk, who believed he ought
to get in an occasional word; although there
were a good many things he did not wholly
understand, and which he would depend on
Jack to further explain when opportunity arose.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins shook them both cordially by the
hand, and took his departure, leaving them to
digest all the startling facts he had placed in
their possession. By slow degrees they would
figure things out, and sketch their plan of operation;
then would come the hour when once more
they must depend on their wings to carry them
many hundreds of miles toward the scene of
action, where the air would be surcharged with
dynamite, while deadly enemies might be lying
in ambush, ready to take them by surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk started to spring his questions, and Jack
was only too glad to make the necessary explanations;
for it was necessary that they work in
complete harmony if they hoped to be successful.</p>

<p class='c013'>As far as they had gone, things looked hopeful
to Jack, as he marshalled the facts that had
lately been placed in their possession. He was
satisfied that when every item had been arranged
in its rightful sequence they could fashion a
plan of campaign that would at least have a
better chance for winning out than any of those
utilized by former detectives, who had not possessed
the essential wings so as to meet Slippery
Slim on his own chosen ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No tellin’ just how long we’ll stick it out in
this burgh, I guess, buddy?” suggested Perk,
some time later, as they continued to take things
easy, resting up after a hard night’s flight, and
meaning to get around the city after noon and
lunch time had come and passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Couldn’t say as yet, Perk; we’ve got to comb
out the stuff as handed over by our new friend,
Mr. Adkins, and discard everything that doesn’t
pan out as being worth while. Then there were
a few leaders he dropped that, if followed up,
might turn out to be leading clues, the possession
of which would possibly turn the tide of battle.
I’m meaning not to let anything make me show
undue speed—Rome wasn’t built in a day, we’ve
got to recollect, and so shape things from the
standpoint of ‘safety first’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! that’s the boy!” gurgled the pleased
Perk; “me, don’t I remember that story o’ the
hare an’ the tortoise runnin’ a race, which the
turtle won ’cause he never even stopped to rest
up; while the rabbit, thinkin’ he could run loops
around such a plodder, lay down to take a nap,
overslept himself, and when he got to the goal
there was Old Leatherback awaitin’ to turn the
big laugh on him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk wound up with one of his rollicking
laughs; everything seemed to create merriment
in his soul just now, after that royal breakfast;
though perhaps he was running away ahead of
the dry facts, and counting his chickens before
they were hatched out of the shell. But Perk
was confident the sly fox of a Slim would find
himself snagged in the net one of these days,
and the clever guy who handled things would
turn out to be an aviator and sky detective named
Jack Ralston.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack some time afterwards, had just aroused
from a short nap, when Perk, who had been
pondering and grumbling to himself, tossed out
another question, as if to disclose what was
troubling him:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it, old hoss, do you b’lieve them
dicks we left behind after they’d floated down
from a high ceilin’ with their chutes, got outen
the scrape, so they could a hiked to some nearby
village or town, an’ took the first train headed
for Orleans, reckonin’ we must a’been on the
jump thisaways?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say the chances all point that way, Perk,”
Jack told him, without the slightest hesitation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jumpin’ crickets! if that’s a fact why, a feller
might run acrost the slick pair any old minute—meet
’em right face to face!” Perk went on to
say, as if the fact gave him more or less concern.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose then you’d recognize the chappies
with just one look, eh, what about that, partner?”
asked Jack, laughingly; at which the other
grinned a bit foolishly, to admit he had serious
doubts on that score.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! didn’t either o’ us get a peep-in at
their monikers, worse luck—had them helmets
and goggles in place right away, like they didn’t
mean to give us a single look-in. S’pose now
they got the high sign on us boys?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“On a venture I’d say that was always possible,”
replied Jack, soberly; for this very point
had occurred to him, and was as yet unsettled
in his mind. “Nobody knows how long they may
have been in Atlanta—Mr. Adkins assured us
Slim seemed to have all sorts of strings out, so
as to learn in advance of any bunch of Government
agents taking the field against his giant
bogus money monopoly; and for all we can tell
those two may have been spying on us most
of the time we were around Candler Field, getting
our ship ready to take to the air.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rotten luck, I’m sayin’, and too much one-sided
to suit me,” growled Perk, frowning savagely.
“Here we got to do our work in the
dark; while that smart cuss holds all the high
cards in the pack, an’ c’n trump our ace any
time he takes a notion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No need to worry about that, comrade,” said
Jack, soothingly. “You must remember that
when we move along we mean to disappear as
if heading into the thickest belt of pea soup fog
ever seen—in that way they’ll lose all trace of
us, and we can play our cards as we choose, making
up for a different breed of sky travelers, so
as to dope the cleverest kind of spies he can send
out. While they’re left guessing what’s become
of us we’ll be doing our little tracking job, and
hour by hour, day after day, keep on creeping
closer to their secret stronghold, wherever that
may prove to be. Those are some of the things
we figured on doing, Perk, don’t forget.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The one addressed made no reply, but as he
let his head fall back, as if he meant to pick up
a few winks of sleep, there came a look of rapt
admiration on his weather-beaten face that bespoke
the utmost confidence in his best pal.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c014'>CHAPTER X <br /> <br />LAYING PLANS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>After a noonday lunch Jack and his partner
spent most of the afternoon in carrying out the
various duties that were seemingly on their program.
Among other things Jack visited the
Federal building, and was closeted for more
than an hour with Mr. Adkins.</p>

<p class='c013'>The latter official had conceived a great fancy
for young Ralston, and went to no end of trouble
so as to post him with regard to what he was
likely to run up against while endeavoring to
close in on Slippery Slim. With his accustomed
sagacity Jack made notes of some of the
facts thus laid before him; but since these were
in shorthand, and would be utterly unintelligible
to any outside party, should they chance
to fall into enemy hands, there was no danger
that any mischief would follow.</p>

<p class='c013'>By degrees he was filling up with scraps of
description, and everything connected with
former attempts at locating the hideout, where
all this unlawful scrip was being turned off the
press, to flood the Southwest.</p>

<p class='c013'>That was always his way of doing—when
given a tough job Jack would live alongside it,
breathing the very atmosphere of the undertaking,
until he found himself sympathetic with the
aims and ambitions of the criminals whose apprehension
was placed on his shoulders by his
Big Boss.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll have dinner early, Perk,” he told the
other, who had been carrying out a number of
special duties while Jack was busy elsewhere,
“so as to retire to our room at the hotel. No
going out after nightfall for us just at present,
especially in a strange city, where some sneak
might waylay us coming back from the theater.
All that sort of pleasure must be put out of our
heads just at present.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! guess you’re hittin’ the nail on the
head, old hoss, when you say that,” grunted
Perk, who very probably had already picked out
just the screen play he wanted so badly to see;
but he was a good scout, and able to put duty
above pleasure, when the occasion arose for
making a personal sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another thing,” continued Jack, “there’s no
telling what night flying we’re bound to be up
against, in trying to keep our movements secret;
so it’d be wise for us both to enjoy all the extra
sleep that comes our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, partner,” assented Perk, subordinating
his desires to the slogan which he knew
was Jack’s watchword—“safety first”. “When
I’ve stowed away all the grub I c’n hold mebbe
I’ll be ready to hit the hay, to stick it out till
cock-crow around daylight—an’ then some.
Pretty fair sleeper, they always called me across
the big pond—crawl out as the last horn was
blowin’, rub my eyes a bit, get aboard my fightin’
crate, an’ step off to knock another Heine pilot
down afore botherin’ ’bout my breakfast—all in a
day’s doings with Gabe Perkiser. Sabbe that,
partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I know you like a book,” Jack told him
with a smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get a bellyfull when you had that confab
with Mr. Adkins?” demanded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m filled up to the brim with all kinds of
material, which by degrees I’ll have to sort out,
keeping only what strikes me as essential,” came
the answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see—sorter separatin’ the chaff from the
wheat,” mused Perk; “an’ if it’s a fair question,
old hoss, which way do we head when we take
off?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You might call it due northeast,” Jack told
him; and then, as his companion uttered a
startled exclamation, as though vastly surprised,
Jack gave a quick glance around as if to make
certain that no one was dogging their footsteps,
after which he lowered his voice almost to a
whisper, to add: “but that would be only for a
<i>blind</i>, in case hostile eyes were watching our
departure from the flying field; for after we’ve
cleared a dozen or more miles we can make a
complete circle, and point the nose of our boat
squarely west!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good boy!” snapped the relieved Perk;
“sounds a heap more like it. You sure did
throw a big scare into me, Jack, ’cause it’d been
’bout settled ’tween us that the game had ought
to be played out there in the boundless waste
spaces around the border.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, everything points that way so far,” he
was assured; “but no more talkie at present,
Perk—we’ll keep bottled up until inside four
walls, where no spy can steal our thunder.
Slim’s knocked the underpinning away from a
bunch of fine schemes looking to his undoing,
simply by finding out what the big game happened
to be, and then bursting the bubble by a
scoop. We don’t intend to dish our business
that way if it can be helped.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wall,” drawled Perk, with his best Yankee
effect, “guess not if we know our stuff, an’ c’n
roll our hoop.”</p>

<p class='c013'>As they walked along toward their hotel Perk
kept up a constant lookout, as though endeavoring
to make some more or less thrilling discovery—never
a man, black or white, did they meet
but that he was made the object of a severe
scrutiny by the suspicious one; however, they
reached their objective without his having run
across any reason for making a decision; and
shortly afterwards they were securely lodged in
their room, the door locked, and a couple of easy
chairs inviting them to take things comfortable,
which they lost no time in doing, being wearied
from so much trotting about—flying men as a
rule not enjoying a reputation for pedestrian
feats.</p>

<p class='c013'>A long and serious confab followed, both
speaking in low tones; Jack on his part explained
the mass of information he had accumulated,
and answered the flood of questions asked
by his comrade, as well as he was able; until he
found a chance to go deeper into things himself
he could not make definite statements concerning
a number of points that were a bit hazy, and
needed confirmation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus the afternoon waned, and the time came
when they were ready to think of the essential
“eats”. Of course it was Perk who brought this
subject up, for he chanced to have a tremendous
appetite, and was apt to give considerable time
to figuring what his next <i>menu</i> would be—indeed,
half the enjoyment in his estimation lay in
thus building air castles along the line of “grub”.</p>

<p class='c013'>Remembering that little episode up in Atlanta,
where some unknown party had made such
a “rat’s nest” of Scotty’s adjoining room, evidently
under a mistaken belief it belonged to
himself and Perk, Jack made sure to carry all
his important papers on his person, properly secured,
so that no deft hand of a sneak thief could
negotiate their abstraction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All ready, partner,” he told Perk, at the time
looking out of the window, holding back the
curtains to see the better who chanced to be
walking along the opposite pavement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never said sweeter words than them, old
boy; I sure was close to faintin’, my tummy
feelin’ like the bottom was adroppin’ out—soup
an’ such soft stuffs, while fillin’ at the time don’t
stay with me any great while—I crave solids
mostly. On your way then, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had marshalled all the facts that had
been placed in his possession, weeded a few out
as worthless, and by the time their discussion
ended had told his companion that the Finger
of Destiny was pointing out their future course
as lying over the almost boundless plains of
Texas, across New Mexico, and deep into Arizona
deserts, to the wild country along the border
not far distant from the spot at which the
Gila river forms a junction with the larger Colorado;
where the latter serves as a watery boundary
line between Arizona and Southeastern California,
with Old Mexico less than thirty miles
distant as the crow flies.</p>

<p class='c013'>It would be a big jump for them, but the flood
of bad currency undoubtedly had its start somewhere
in this hostile region, and spread out like
an open fan, northwest into San Diego and Los
Angeles—northward up to Salt Lake City—and
in the northeast as far as Oklahoma. To
effectually break it up it was necessary that they
go to the fountain head, so as to destroy the very
roots of the noisome poison ivy plant.</p>

<p class='c013'>They spent more than half an hour dining,
and needless to say Perk enjoyed himself to his
heart’s content—who wouldn’t if he had a pocketfull
of ready cash, furnished by a bountiful
Uncle Sam; a bill of fare bristling with all kinds
of tempting dishes such as Perk doted on; and
to complete the combination having been born
with a healthy, unbridled appetite?</p>

<p class='c013'>It was just commencing to get dusk when they
emerged from the restaurant and started back to
the hotel, some two blocks distant. Perk, as
usual, kept turning his head this way and that
very much like a wolf scalp-hunter looking for
his suspicious quarry. Presently he picked at
Jack’s sleeve, and bending his head until his lips
almost touched the other’s ear he observed in a
sibilant whisper!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen, partner—we got a clam doggin’ us
like a bloodhound on the track o’ a runaway nigger
from a convict camp back in Alabam—get
that, do you?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c014'>CHAPTER XI <br /> <br />THE NIGHT ALARM</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“I’m not thrilled by what you say, Perk, because
I’ve been more than half expecting to hear
that discovery. Glad you got on to him okay;
because it’s always best to know what’s in the
wind. What sort of a chap is he like?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack spoke in his usual calm way, and the other
realized he had undoubtedly been prepared for
the sudden news.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ out o’ the way ’bout his looks, far as
I c’n see,” was Perk’s reply; “on’y got a few
squints at the guy; but he’s keepin’ tab o’ our
movements I guess now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Reckon he might be one of those lads in the
Ryan ship that crashed in flames after they’d
flown the coop?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! just can’t be dead sure, partner,”
chuckled Perk; “but there’s somethin’ ’bout his
walk that gets me into believin’ he’s the <i>kiwi</i>
that pilot was keepin’ on our tail so long, stickin’
like a leech from a mud-hole.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder,” the other went on to say, as if
talking to himself; “if that’s the case then, both
those duffers pulled through with their lives, and
not so badly hurt. Honestly I’m a bit glad that’s
so, for up to the present I’ve never had occasion
to take a human life.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk snorted on hearing this.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if so be you’d been ten years older, my
boy, mebbe you’d not be able to say that—chances
are you’d a been mixed up in that mess across the
Atlantic, when Yanks an’ Johnny Rebs were
fightin’ shoulder to shoulder, and it was a case o’
a Heine pilot’s life or our’n. But if you keep
on with Uncle Sam’s service as you’re adoin’
right now, the time’ll come for you to fetch back
a dead man who jest <i>wouldn’t</i> let hisself be captured.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like as not,” remarked Jack; “but there’s no
need of crossing a river till you come to it; so
I’m not taking trouble by the forelock away
ahead of time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’ll we do ’bout this dickey bird that’s
bobbin’ at our heels so gaily, tell me, partner?”
pursued Perk, eagerly, as though in his fighting
heart he was actually hoping his superior would
give the order to turn on their persistent pursuer,
and at least blacken both his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! nothing at all, Perk; let him run his
rope; only we’ll keep along streets where there’s
plenty of company, and be prepared for any sort
of ambush; though I can’t believe he’d be crazy
enough to start anything so early in the evening—if
the hour was close to midnight, things
might be different. There are any number of
tough cases in this old Creole city ready to handle
a sticking game for the coin in it—blacks and
yellows and whites it doesn’t matter which—all
of them are assassins at heart.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then you don’t care if he shadows us straight
to the hotel?” demanded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Much good that will do him.” said Jack with
a light laugh; “the chances are two to one he
already knows where we’ve put up, and has had
some spy dog me to the Federal building. When
the time comes for us to jump off we’ll find a
slick way to hop our ship without giving these
boys a show-down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently they arrived at the hotel entrance,
without any untoward incident arising to mar
the quiet of the evening. Perk cast a parting
glance toward their rear just before entering,
and seeing the shadowy figure hovering not far
away, considered it a part of his duty to place
his thumb to his nose, and wiggle his fingers
derisively, at the same time uttering a snarl like
a bobcat at bay, to express his utter contempt.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once in their room, Jack first of all cast about
as if to decide whether any uninvited guest had
intruded on their preserves while they were absent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything seems to be just as we left it,”
he told his running mate, after making this little
survey, “and even if some busybody did get in
here with the aid of a pass-key borrowed from a
chambermaid, he was shrewd enough not to mess
things up like they did with our friend Scotty
of the air mail bunch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess now they must acome to the conclusion
you keep the letter o’ instructions ’bout your
person,” suggested Perk, wisely, “which, bein’
the case mebbe now they figger on sneakin’ in
here while we’re sound asleep, an’ agoin’ through
your clothes in regulation style. They do tell me
there be sneak thieves right clever in this same
burgh, equal to the ones out in India, where they
c’n steal the sheet from under a sleeper, without
wakin’ him up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I understand that’s really true, partner,” Jack
agreed; “but we’re not going to let them have
half a chance, even if they hired all the crooks
in New Orleans to play the game.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sounds good to me, boss,” Perk declared.
“We’ll manage to sleep with one eye open, an’
if any critter tries to give us the once over, he’ll
wish he’d never been born, that’s all I know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Before turning in, Jack placed a chair so nicely
balanced that in case of the door being ever so
slightly opened it would crash to the floor, making
enough noise to arouse the Seven Sleepers.
Perk grinned at seeing him prepare this “guardian
angel” as he termed it, and lost no time himself
in “hitting the hay.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Some time later in the night, when outside
noises had almost died away, there came a loud
clatter that awoke both the sleepers instantly.
They bounced out on the floor in their pajamas,
with Jack pulling the cord he had attached to
the electric bulb, so that the room was magically
illuminated.</p>

<p class='c013'>The chair lay on its side, and just beyond Perk
could see that their door was partly open; the
key had been left in the lock, but skillful fingers
must have manipulated it by means of
slender-jawed pliers, showing the touch of a professional
thief.</p>

<p class='c013'>Straight toward the door the form of Perk was
projected—a hungry lion could hardly have
made a more pronounced leap at some four-legged
game which he had been stalking.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tearing open the door still wider, Perk thrust
out his head, and looked up and down the hotel
corridor. He fancied he could make out a dim
figure far along the poorly lighted hall, but it
vanished like a phantom even as he stared, evidently
turning some corner.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there were other sounds arising—doors
all along the corridor were opening, and heads
being projected, showing how the startling alarm
had awakened numerous other sleepers, who
may have imagined an earthquake was in process
of occurring, though such a happening was utterly
foreign to the metropolis on the Lower Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c013'>Voices, too, were heard, from both masculine
as well as feminine sources, as the aroused hotel
guests endeavored to fathom the real meaning
of the row.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, seeing there was nothing doing, closed
the door, and locked it again; after which he
turned to his companion who had been watching
his actions with more or less amusement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Consarn his picture,” growled the old fighter;
“he got off scot free; I jest glimpsed him
aturnin’ the first bend down the hall. Blamed
shame I couldn’t come to grips with the yeller
cub—I’d a given a heap to twist his neck
some, you bet I would. Mebbe now I’d otter sit
up the rest o’ the night to make certain, eh,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not the slightest need of such a thing, partner,”
Jack assured him. “I’ll fix that door so it
won’t be opened again in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c013'>With that he again took the stout chair, and
placed it diagonally against the door, so that its
top rested just under the knob; after that had
been accomplished it must needs be a battering-ram
that could burst in on them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not content with that, Jack went to each of
the two windows, thrust out his head to examine
for the second time the face of the outer wall of
the building so as to make sure there was no
ledge wide enough to give a would-be trespasser
foothold.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not the ghost of a chance for the most nimble
thief to get in by way of a window, Perk, so
back to bed we go, and sleep like babes in the
wood for we’re in the third story and far enough
from a fire escape to be secure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk grinned and nodded acquiescence; truth
to tell he was not at all averse to starting all over
again—possibly the rude interruption had disturbed
him just when he was starting to partake
of a royal feast that covered every one of his most
beloved dishes and he was hugging the delusion
to his heart that if given another chance history
might repeat itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>At least there was no further alarm, and the
night passed into oblivion like all its countless
predecessors with the rising sun arousing the
two comrades, and Perk as usual singing out
that he felt as though he could easily manage two
customary breakfasts in that delighful restaurant
where they were already feeling so much at
home.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c014'>CHAPTER XII <br /> <br />PLAYING WITH FIRE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>During the morning Jack took a taxi and paid
another visit to the offices in the government
building where Mr. Adkins had his desk, doing
his daily stunt under the direction of the U. S.
District Attorney and other officials in the service
of Uncle Sam.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, also, had his job laid out for him, which
was to circulate around until he felt positive he
had thrown off any possible spy after which it
was his duty to make certain purchases, following
the list Jack had given him, have them all
sent to the aviation field in charge of the man
Mr. Adkins had placed on guard at the hangar
containing their ship and thus completing the
stock of supplies necessary for their long flight
and survey work.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk carried out his instructions to the letter,
and with great vim, since the fact of their laying
in these stores was a positive indication that
things were coming to pass insuring a speedy
getaway and <i>Action</i> was what had come to be
the greatest asset in life to Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>They met again at noon in their eating place,
where, choosing an isolated corner table they
could discuss their plan of campaign, even while
attending to the wants of the inner man.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk made his report, which the other seemed
to find good, judging from his frequent nods of
acquiescence and when the story had been told
to the last word, Perk felt it was his turn to
learn things.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess now you got the last batch o’ information
from His Nibs, Jack?” he hastened to
ask, expectantly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sure did, partner,” he was told. “A few
scraps of fresh news that’d be likely to interest
us had drifted in since I saw Mr. Adkins last,
which he passed along to me. I’ll sort these
shreds over later, and fix them where they belong.
So far as I can see now they corroborate
what we’ve already been so strongly believing
must be a fact.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which means, I guess, boss, we head west?”
ventured Perk, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Into the setting sun—that’s right, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do we still expect to keep in touch with Mr.
Adkins, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whenever the chance opens up, and we have
any important news to send along or want to
know certain things, perhaps even to call on him
for that bunch of old-time Texas Rangers he
said he could turn over to us if we found any
use for them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be!” said Perk, plainly excited, “I
sure do hope that emergency does bob up, ’cause
I’d give my last Mex dollar to glimpse them
rearin’, tearin’ ole fighters knockin’ spots outen
the bunch o ’lawless ringers Slippery Slim’s
gathered around him. Chances are they’d skip
out like hot fleas soon as they heard the ol’time
battle cry o’ the defenders o’ the Rio Grande in
the days when cattle rustlers raided the ranches
down Texas way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But we’ve got to remember,” cautioned
Jack, “that these chaps are like lean hungry
wolves, that never leave the trail of a wounded
stag as long as they can crawl along. I’m not
fancying we’ve pulled the wool over their eyes
so far and that fact was brought to my attention
just after I got back from conferring with
Mr. Adkins.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As how, boss?” queried the curious Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t just know what influenced me after
I’d entered the hotel, to step back and look out
again,” explained Jack. “There was the driver
of my taxi, the trusty who’d been recommended
by the clerk at the desk, talking earnestly with
an unknown party and even as I watched I saw
him thrust a bank note into the chauffeur’s itching
hand, showing that he has been corrupted
and is in cohoot with our enemies.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! is it so rotten bad as all that, partner?”
bleated the disgusted Perk, “All I c’n
say is I sure do hope it was a nice brand new five-dollar
bill he handed over to the yeller dog, an’
that it’s agoin’ to turn out to be a sample o’ their
bogus money outfit. Serve the slick renegade if
he got hisself pulled in for passin’ a counterfeit
note on some guy that ain’t goin’ to sit by and
take what’s comin’ to him without raisin’ a nice
howl.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t be too vindictive, Perk,” Jack told
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, partner, ever see the boob afore?” the
other demanded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you mean the chap who was pumping my
driver for all that was out, Perk, I can’t say
that I have. He was a flashily dressed man,
with loud clothes that would stamp him as a
gambler, like those who used to travel on these
Mississippi River steamboats in the old days before
the Civil War, fleecing unsuspecting passengers
out of all their money and I haven’t
the least doubt but what he’s a member of the
very gang we’re expecting to round up. Mr.
Adkins told me it was simply amazing the vastness
of the combine Slippery Slim’s managed to
gather around him but he was certain it must
number many scores of workers, all obeying the
orders of the mainspring—crooked Slim Garrabrant.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! the more you keep on tellin’ me them
big stories, Jack, the happier it all makes me
’cause I seem to just know there’s bound to be a
heap o’ rough house stuff croppin’ up, to cool
my blood, ragin’ hot just now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some fine day you’ll be rubbing up against
enough fighting to make you call quits with the
game. Perk, my boy; and it’s just likely to crop
up before long if indications count for anything.
I felt pretty sure from his swagger that
this fellow might be the very same master mind
in charge of that Ryan boat—then, too, when he
walked away he had a little limp, which might
have come from striking the ground so hard
after his chute let him down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Darned pity he didn’t break a leg, or even
his measly ol’ neck, I’d say,” grumbled Perk, one
of his fits of resentment gripping him just then.
“Got no use for these treacherous snakes that
squirm, and worm their way into the confidence
o’ honest gents, on’y to play a low-down trick,
an’ fill their pockets with smackers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s one thing we’ve got to guard
against,” suggested Jack, who seemed to have a
faculty for looking at every side of a picture,
and anticipating troubles that might never have
occurred to others less gifted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As what, partner?” asked Perk, brightening
up once more.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Delay is what they may be hoping for—some
way to hold us here while important news is
carried to headquarters. I can even see how
they might make some sort of ridiculous charge
against us to the police, in hopes we would be
held several days under suspicion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk looked astonished.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But see here, boss, we got our credentials
from Washington to prove we’re in the Secret
Service, an’ sky detectives at that; they jest
wouldn’t dare hold us on some sorter flimsy
charge ’cause that’d get ’em in hard with the
Government, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never know how these affairs may turn
out,” said Jack. “Often there seems to be some
kind of a jealous feeling between States officers
and those of the Government—almost like a little
vendetta, each arm of the Law striking out
at the other, and getting in a sly lick that’s good
for a laugh after hostilities have died down.
These Southern city police might make out
there was a grave charge of abduction or something
like that, compelling them to hold us <i>incommunicado</i>—that
is keep us from intercourse
with the U. S. District Attorney’s office until
several days had elapsed and then setting us
free with a lot of apologies that didn’t mean anything
whatsoever.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! I get your drift partner,” said Perk,
frowning. “We sure can’t afford to spend any
of our valuable time in the hoosgow here, if we
c’n help it. ’Cause things set that way I hope
you get busy an’ fix it so we’ll shake the dust o’
this same burgh off our shoes in a hurry. Got
the date settled yet, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shook hands with, and said goodbye to Mr.
Adkins this morning, Perk and you are at
liberty to figure that out as you please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it’s <i>tonight</i>?” asked the other, looking
well satisfied with such an enticing programme.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wind and weather permitting we’ll clear out
soon after twilight settles down on the city and
the river,” Jack assured his understudy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me, I’m sittin’ pretty, an’ taking things as
they come along, old hoss,” continued Perk.
“Let’s perambulate and attend to the crying
needs of this high noon hour—the girl told me
they expected to have apple dumplings for lunch
today an’ that’s one I’d nominate as bein’ among
my prime favorites—you know I got a <i>few</i> I
really enjoy an’ that’s no lie either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I know a good many on your list—fact
is,” said frank Jack, “if I ran down the whole
menu this noon there’d be only a scant few that’s
missed being called your especial favorites each
in its turn as the wind blew. But just as well
we did all the eating while the chance lasts, for
only a magician can tell what our bill of fare is
going to be during the coming week or two—some
weird dishes most likely—boiled owl,
fried rattlesnake, baked prairie dog—Heaven
knows to what ends we may be reduced.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have a heart, partner, don’t take my healthy
appetite away by mentionin’ them terrible
dishes. ’Member you promised we’d hire a taxi
after lunch, an’ drive all around the city, lampin’
the big sights like the French market, the queer
buryin’ places where holes in thick walls take
the place o’ graves, on ’count o’ there bein’ so
much water in the ground, with the city settin’
so low down, an’ the ol’ Mississippi on one o’
its benders. Then I want to eat Gulf oysters
an’ shrimp at one o’ them cute little stands we
noticed yesterday afternoon; try a reg’lar Creole
dinner tonight at that place Mr. Adkins told us
about—after which I’m all done with Orleans,
an’ ready to pull up stakes for keeps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll keep that to the last, Perk, and go to
the flying field from the eating house by taxi.
From that time on we’ll have to depend on our
own heads and hands to keep us out of difficulties.
But let’s hope we can climb up to a three
thousand foot ceiling, and strike out as if we
were aiming for Savannah or Jacksonville, only
to swing around inside of half an hour, climb
high over the city and river and put for the
Texas border at full speed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This enchanting program gave Perk much
cause for rejoicing and he sat down at their regular
table in the restaurant feeling, as he expressed
it, “happy as a clam at high tide” and
full of little laughs that seemed to gurgle up
from his shoes.</p>

<p class='c013'>They chatted of other happenings, not wishing
to “talk shop” in such a crowded place, lest
listening ears pick up certain information that
could be used greatly to their disadvantage—Perk
had an endless fund of interesting reminiscences
that, told in his inimitable fashion,
were a never failing source of joy to the appreciative
air pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was spent in motoring all
around the most interesting portions of the city,
the obliging Mr. Adkins having made out a list
of subjects they should not miss seeing while on
this first visit to the justly famous Louisiana metropolis.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIII <br /> <br />THE HOP-OFF</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Leaving the hotel, after settling their account,
and still making use of the taxi with its accommodating
driver, Jack and his comrade had
taken what small amount of hand luggage they
possessed along with them, not meaning to come
back again.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins had recommended a small but
unique restaurant run by a buxom French madame,
where they could have a Creole supper,
such as would long haunt their memories as a
genuine treat and it was to this place they ordered
their driver to convey them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both of them felt fairly convinced they had
been shadowed during the afternoon, although
so carefully must this have been accomplished
they had no positive proof to make it what Perk
would term a “dead certainty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They really did have a delightful “feed,” and
the dishes set before them were as a rule complete
mysteries although the obliging madame,
seeing they were tasting her triumphs of the
French <i>chef’s</i> art for the first time, gladly explained
the nature of the food they consumed
with so much gusto.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was fascinated with his supper, and inwardly
vowed that this should not be the last time
he would partake of tasty Creole dishes. This
duty fulfilled, they faced the next progressive
step in their night’s program—making for
the aviation field, and boarding their ship for
a speedy takeoff, their ultimate goal neither of
them could say just where, save that if all went
well they expected to be somewhere along the
California border within the next few days.</p>

<p class='c013'>The taxi was waiting, with the chauffeur on
the alert. He had already been advised of the
fact that they anticipated having some parties
attempt to spy upon them as evening settled
down and on this account he had maintained a
strict watch for troublesome visitors who might
even attempt to threaten him with bodily injury
unless he agreed to enter into their plans for
delaying the flight of the two flyers, as he knew
his passengers to be from what he had been told.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I see our taxi’s still on deck, partner,”
observed Perk, just as if he might have suspected
they would find it missing, with a detail of grim
city police waiting to escort them to the lockup,
they to be held in durance vile until serious
charges against them could be sifted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing came along to bother you, Henri?”
asked Jack of the smiling driver, who laughed
as he said in reply:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I haf seen one beeg hulk of ze man hanging
around, M’sieu, and looking as if he would like
to eat me up but me, I haf been an old soldier
in the Grand Army of France, and I think he did
not like the way I throw my chest out thees way,
and walk as eef I am on guard duty; he did not
address a single word to me, but just a little
while ago he disappear—I think he may haf
gone to get more courage out of ze glass.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good boy, Henri,” said the grinning Perk,
clapping a hand on the stalwart chauffeur’s
shoulder; “for myself I should not like to tackle
you when you have your fighting face all set.
Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So they were off, and heading out in the direction
of the aviation grounds, with the first shadows
of approaching evening gathering around
them. Perk may have been more or less nervous,
in anticipation of something coming to pass that
would seriously cripple their plans for a speedy
flight, since he kept turning his head from side
to side and scrutinizing every one they saw upon
the streets they traversed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Henri maintained a fairly good speed, all the
law would permit, so that few cars passed them
on the road. Perk managed to watch closely,
and never a motor came booming along in their
wake, honking to announce the driver’s intention
to pass by, than he had his eyes glued on the car
and continued to pay strict attention until it
had crept well up ahead.</p>

<p class='c013'>But after all nothing out of the way came to
pass, and eventually they reached the aviation
field where they found lights already in play,
since a delayed air mail ship was hovering over
signaling for better illumination. There was
some small damage in regard to the steering
gear, making it a bit risky to try a landing unless
the field was brilliantly lighted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You made an arrangement with a couple of
the ground force to hang around so as to help
us get the crate out okay, didn’t you, Perk?”
queried Jack, as they drew up close to the particular
hangar where they had seen their plane
placed in quarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, I sure did, Jack,” the other replied.
“Must be they’re over where that crate hanging
overhead means to land—somethin’ wrong mebbe
but they gimme their word to stay around
till we got here—there, I c’n lamp the guys
runnin’ thisaways right now, so it’s okay, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I see them coming,” returned the other,
himself a bit relieved, since the intended departure
was a most important episode in their plans,
and to meet with any sort of a setback would
be most aggravating indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The two mechanicians quickly arrived, the
hanger was unlocked and opened so as to permit
the exit of the ship. First of all both flyers
hastened to don their working togs, then fasten
on the ’chutes with the harness necessary for the
purpose, all working smoothly and finally clapping
their helmets on their heads, with the earflaps
secured to keep things in readiness for any
emergency that might crop up.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being accomplished, Jack gave the word
to have the heavy ship dragged out into the open.
He knew that his assistant would have looked
after everything essential to their comfort during
the coming flight for Perk was one of those
dependable fellows who carry out orders with
machine-like regularity.</p>

<p class='c013'>A few parties had hastened up to see what
was going on but so far as Perk could tell they
were either workers connected with the field, or
else visitors from the city, who had lingered to
watch the landing of the air mail, so as to tell
how it was done when they reached their several
homes, to partake of a late supper.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now the ship had been swung around so as
to head into the west, since the soft evening breeze
was coming from that quarter and everything
seemed in readiness for the take-off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, still surveying his surroundings as if
still cherishing a fragment of his former suspicions
that all might not be as lovely as surface
indications would announce, started to climb
aboard. Jack on his part was handing some
money to the two men, not wishing to leave a
single thing unpaid when passing out from New
Orleans—there was nothing to be done about
their use of the hangar, since Mr. Adkins had
assured him that matter had already been taken
care of, regardless of how long they chose to
linger in the Crescent City.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, too, cast a last glance around, just as he
would have done had he still been with the air
mail service and about to start off on his customary
night flight with the north-bound sacks
of letters and the express matter that vent along.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then he heard Perk give vent to a hurried
exclamation:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get aboard, partner; I guess the measly critters
are acomin’ down on us like hot cakes right
now. Lookit how they start arunnin’ thisaway,
will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did not bother looking, as every second
might be valuable; he climbed aboard with alacrity,
and settled down in his seat; at the same time
calling out to the helpers to stand aside. Then
he pulled the gun, with the motor responding
instantly, so well had Perk done his work when
checking up the ship that morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was still glueing his eyes on the several
figures now racing madly in their general direction,
and waving their arms wildly; no doubt
they had started to shout in addition, but the
descending air mail crate was making more or
less racket, which, added to by their own motor’s
thunder, prevented any one from hearing what
they may have been whooping.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was trembling with an excess of emotion—evidently
they had just escaped “by the
skin of their teeth,” for he felt certain he could
distinguish the uniforms of the police in the
little bunch of runners.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Played your hand just a mite too late, gents!”
Perk was whooping as he in turn waved a mocking
adieu backward; “thought you’d ketch a
weasel asleep, I guess, but not so easy, you gate
crashers. Wow! here we go spinnin’ along like
the wind, and it’s goodnight to the bunch. Huh!
shootin’ at us, air you—jest awastin’ ammunition,
that’s all, boys. Go ’way back an’ sit down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Jack lifted her in an upward fling, and
they were off like a startled hawk!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIV <br /> <br />SKIRTING THE GULF</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There was some shooting going on back there,
for although of course the watchful Perk failed
to catch the sound of discharges of guns, he did
see flash after flash, proclaiming that the police,
under the impression that important criminals
were beating them to it, wished to show
their warlike spirit by such a bombardment.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the flying missiles came anywhere near the
ascending plane that fact was not manifest to the
two occupants of the cockpit; their movements
must have been too speedy for such an attack to
be successful and almost immediately they had
risen beyond the danger line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was feeling vastly relieved, for it would
have been a bad beginning of their special mission
were they detained for days in the Southern
city, while the agents of the great counterfeit
league held the upper hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>He could see with the last glimpse he had of
the aviation field that all this lively accompaniment
to their take-off had created considerable
excitement—people were running back and
forth, like milling cattle when stampeded in a
furious thunder storm and Perk even fancied
there was some sort of a movement as though a
ship would be sent after them in pursuit.</p>

<p class='c013'>That troubled him not a bit, because already
they were leaving the field far in their wake, and
would really be lost in the gathering shadows of
coming night before any pursuit plane left the
ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides, had they not already had one experience
along those lines, and completely worsted
the persistent enemy, sending their boat down in
spirals of flames, with the two occupants forced
to “bail out” in order to save their lives?</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk put that possibility completely out of
his mind and busied himself with more practical
affairs. First of all he was desirous of communicating
with his comrade and to do this
they must have those indispensible head-phones
clapped to their ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was already applying his own pair with a
confidence inspired by frequent applications,
after which he managed to get Jack equipped
with the other pair.</p>

<p class='c013'>Steadily they continued to ascend, and swing
around until they faced the east, following the
plan Jack had outlined to his mate. Not too
high did the pilot urge his craft, since such a
course was apt to bring them in the sunlight
that still lingered along the upper air lanes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, they turned out to be a hot bunch all
right, partner,” was what Perk observed, when
he had the harness adjusted and the ear-phone
means of communication in shape for use.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You reckon they must have fetched the police
out with them, do you, Perk?” demanded the
one at the stick, as he kept an eye on his dials
spread across the black dashboard in front of the
cockpit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! just what they did, old hoss,” returned
the other, vehemently, but accompanying his remark
with a loud chuckle that told of secret
amusement, he being excessively fond of anything
that smacked of a joke; “an’ they kept up
a runnin’ fire at us, let me tell you—could see the
flashes spittin’ like fire crackers on the Fourth
o’ July.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All of which sounds like they must have told
a pretty wild and woolly yarn to the cops, to
make them want us as bad as that, eh, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Makes me think they got an idea this ain’t
goin’ to be just a ordinary man-hunt, but something
worth while; we should worry, Jack.
Mebbe they a’ready see the handwritin’ on the
wall, an’ mean to try an’ upset us in the start,
’fore we get agoin’ full tilt. Notice you’ve gone
an’ headed east, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It may fool them; but whether it does or not,
Perk, such a move’s our proper caper. When
we’ve gone something like ten or fifteen miles
we’ll get on the curve, swing around to the south,
and then when in sight of the gulf turn due west;
after that we’ll be on our way to the place where
our work is waiting for us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! had an idea you’d just climb till out
o’ sight, an’ then cross over the city and river—how
’bout it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too much risk to begin with,” came the ready
reply, showing how Jack always planned ahead;
“you know how a rushing boat can be heard
clearly even when lost to sight among the clouds.
It might be those same smart chaps, backed by
the authority of the police, would commandeer
a ship, and cruise around over the city, so as to
learn if we <i>did</i> come back so as to line out into
the heart of Texas; to make sure such a giveaway
of our plans can’t upset our calculations
we’ll cross the delta of the Mississippi close to
where it joins its muddy waters with the gulf.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you now, partner, an’ let me say I guess
that’s the safest game we c’n play. Time don’t
count anything wuth while with us on this trip
but results are what we crave.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it that time, boy, the Big Boss has
confidence in our being able to fetch home the
bacon, and we’re bound to prove he didn’t make
any mistake in putting us on the job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>All this time they continued to zoom along
like a frightened wild duck, and it was not long
before Jack was turning the nose of his ship
toward the south. The night had not as yet
settled down over the earth, although they were
holding an altitude of several thousand feet and
by straining his eyes a bit Perk was able to distinguish
objects far below—he could tell when
they passed over a large sheet of water, probably
Lake Ponchartrain, with narrower cuts winding
through vast marshes, and seas of waving reeds;
also begin to catch fugitive glimpses of the still
distant Mexican Gulf stretching away to the
mysterious south.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was all deeply interesting to Perk, always
on the lookout for fresh and novel scenes; for as
it happened, thus far in all his wanderings he
had really never looked upon that historical sheet
of salt water; although reading many a rattling
romance of the days when buccaneers and pirates
haunted the sub-tropical waters of that same
gulf, lying in wait for the Spanish galleons laden
with gold bars taken from the prodigally rich
mines of Mexico and Central America.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Perk’s mind those historical personages,
like Blackbeard, and his fellow rovers of the
Black Flag, lent a glamour to the great body of
water that was apt to thrill him through and
through whenever he allowed his gaze to fall
upon its restless surface, and dark secrets of the
past ages.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards their course was again
altered, with the ship swinging into the west. It
would seem to have been something like extreme
caution on Jack’s part but from all accounts, as
well as from their own experience with the desperate
gang that had given Uncle Sam so much
trouble, the scoundrels had a tremendous game
at stage, and were ready to go to any lengths to
protect the profitable conspiracy from being
smashed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Safety before speed” had always been Jack’s
slogan, which could be accounted one of the leading
reasons for the success that had come to him
in the various vocations he had followed—as a
county fair barn-stormer, then in the regular air
mail service, and now finally with the celebrated
Secret Service arm of the Government, entrusted
with one of the most abnormal duties ever given
out to its members.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not too dark for Perk to know when they
were passing over the several outlets to the
mighty river; indeed, he was even able to distinguish
an ocean going steamship heading up
toward the city of New Orleans; for its lights
were plainly in evidence and those who chanced
to be on deck could probably catch the throb of
their motor, since the air was unusually still,
allowing sounds to be heard at great distances,
especially when in the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then finally they left the water behind, and
found themselves passing over great stretches of
sugarcane, and bamboo thickets, with cabins of
the humble blacks in little hamlets, sometimes
villages of the lowlands, where, as Perk plainly
recollected, recent terrible floods had wrought
such damage.</p>

<p class='c013'>So the night wore on, and thus far nothing
had occurred to cause them the slightest worry.
If their cunning enemies suspected them of
planning to go west, and baiting the chief in his
lair, there was nothing as yet to show that they
were making arrangements to intercept the air
adventurers on their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>An hour—two of them passed, and still they
kept making rapid progress. The moon was long
above the eastern horizon, although occasionally
obscured by passing clouds but Perk told himself
it was a pretty fair night, all things considered,
and that he had “no kick coming.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c014'>CHAPTER XV <br /> <br />PERK AS A FIRE-FIGHTER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was not far from midnight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had insisted on taking over the controls,
so that Jack might secure a little rest, possibly
even pick up a few catnaps in addition. They
were at a low altitude, perhaps not more than a
thousand feet up, since the air was a bit cool
higher and it was certain they stood in no
danger from colliding with mountain peaks
while crossing the wide State of Texas, where
nothing save the level plains lay beneath.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was alive to his duties, but this did not
keep him from occasionally stretching his neck,
so as to look over the coaming of the cockpit,
and trying to make out objects that might be
dimly detected on the seemingly limitless plain
below.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a rule next to nothing worth while rewarded
these efforts and really he continued
doing his little stunt from sheer habit, but there
did come a time when he showed sudden interest,
and even half arose from his seat to stare
with increasing intensity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not only that but he immediately banked, to
start circling around a certain point. A minute
afterwards Perk reached out and shook Jack
gently by the shoulder. The ear-phones being
still affixed to their heads, Jack naturally desired
to know what was up, and did his pal wish to
give over the stick to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ doing, partner,” he was told with
emphasis; “but there’s somethin’ queer goin’ on
down yonder, and I’ve swung around so’s to give
it the once over. On your right, Jack, an’ there,
see how it sparks up again, will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say it looks like a fire,” ventured Jack,
after taking a good look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My idea to a fraction, boss!” snapped the
deeply interested Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like it might be breaking out through
the roof of some sort of cabin, or ranch house,”
further suggested Jack, himself now almost as
excited as his running mate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, boy!” declared Perk; “but somehow
I don’t lamp anybody kickin’ around in a
big fuss, ’cause o’ the shack bein’ ablaze; strikes
me either nobody ain’t to home or else they’re
so sound asleep they don’t know what’s goin’ on.
Glory be! if that’s the case, partner, they stand
a mighty good chance o’ bein’ burnt to death in
their beds. What ought we do ’bout it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“First place we’ve just got to rouse ’em up,
and the way to do that is to rush our engine to the
limit, so’s to make a big row—if that doesn’t
wake anybody it’ll only mean they’re away from
home—or else already smothered by the smoke.”
Perk accordingly started up such a racket that
the dreadful roaring noise seemed hoarse enough
to awaken the dead and all the while he kept
swinging around in a continuous circle.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, bending over the side, watched to see if
this had any effect, nor was his discovery long
delayed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That fetched them, Perk—I can see several
moving figures, and they seem to be rushing about
with pails in their hands. If the fire hasn’t got
too strong a start they may be able to throw
enough water to put it out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, couldn’t we do somethin’ more to help
the poor dicks?” cried Perk, ever ready and
willing to assist anybody in trouble, no matter
at what cost or personal risk to himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It mightn’t be a safe thing to attempt a blind
landing,” he was told; but something in Jack’s
voice or manner when he said this encouraged
Perk to go a bit further.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, chances are it’s as level as a barn floor
down there,” he hastened to say, eagerly; “here,
you could take the stick—there never was a better
hand at makin’ a three-point landin’ than
you, partner; me, I might drop a few flares down,
an’ that’d give us a squint o’ the ground. If we
kept to leeward o’ the fire there wouldn’t be any
risk from sparks, don’t you see, Jack? I never
yet had such a fat chance to be a fire-fighter;
let’s go, boy—they need all the help they c’n
get, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The temptation was so great it soon overpowered
Jack’s sense of caution; really he fancied
he would never forgive himself if he allowed
Perk to show a higher sense of duty to people
in distress than he himself could display.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, you win, Perk!” he quickly called
out; “hand over the stick, and get those flares
ready to drop when I give the word.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk started to make a move, showing that he
knew just where the objects of his desire were
located, for he did not have to leave his seat in
order to place his hand upon the small package
of flares.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile Jack had reduced their speed to
a minimum compatible with safety, still continuing
that circular movement. The fire had
by this time assumed sufficient proportions to
dispel any doubts they may have entertained regarding
its true nature, for it was burning at a
lively rate. Jack could see a crouching figure
sprawled on the roof, and apparently emptying
bucket after bucket of water on the greedy flames,
and passing the empties back down the nearby
ladder to some one standing on an upper rung.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was all mighty exciting, and to Jack seemed
like some sort of fetching picture as shown on
the silver screen at the movies—a scene developed
through the skill of a wizard director, aided
by a group of star actors, so as to bring out all
the realistic effects.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get ready, Perk!” he told the other suddenly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All set, partner,” came the inspiring response.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let her go, then!” called out the pilot, just
as he found himself over a point to leeward of the
burning ranch house that he figured would be
the best place to make a landing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had a flare falling almost as the last
words left the lips of the pilot and then both
of them used their eyes to advantage as it neared
the ground, lighting up a small section fairly
well—at least what he thus saw seemed to convince
Jack it would be fairly safe to attempt a
landing, for the ground looked smooth, and free
from outbuildings, corrals, or wire fences.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Drop another, quick as you can!” directed
Jack; then, as this was carried out he started
down, showing the die was cast, come what
would.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk threw a third flare to one side, in the
hope that its light would afford his pilot a chance
to effect one of his really marvelous landings;
which turned out to be sound reasoning on his
part—the shock when their landing gear came in
contact with the ground was not very severe, and
Jack managed so that they did not run more than
thirty feet toward the burning house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus far all was well.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was out of the cockpit like a flash, but
managed to hold his eager spirit in check long
enough to allow his comrade to join him. Then
they hurried over to the building, which they
could now see, thanks to both the moonlight and
the brilliance of the blaze, must be some kind of
a ranch house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Several men who had the appearance of cow
punchers were working for all they were worth,
fetching water from a well, and hurling it where
it was calculated to do the most good.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s give you a hand in that game, neighbors!”
Jack burst out with, as he joined the string,
backed by Perk, and commenced handling
buckets full and buckets empty, with as much
vim as though tested and tried members of a
village fire company.</p>

<p class='c013'>At such a time the addition of two more
willing workers can do considerable toward
smothering a fire, especially when there happens
to be no wind moving; and from the moment of
their arrival things began to take on a better
look as though up to then the fight had been
hovering “on the fence,” as Perk called it, and
the balance being overturned, victory was in
sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was in his glory, and the brisk way in
which he hurried those buckets along was worth
going a long way to witness; Jack never would
forget how proud he felt over the marvelous performance
of his running mate, and how those
encouraging cries, so constantly emitted by Perk,
seemed to enthuse everybody with fresh vim and
go.</p>

<p class='c013'>Finally the last spark was extinguished, and
the house saved, having suffered but scant damage.
Then the men, yes, and women too, gathered
around the pair of aviators who had come
on the scene just in the nick of time, to first of
all arouse the people of the prairie ranch to a
sense of the danger that hovered over their heads,
and finally take chances in effecting what might
have been a rough landing, so as to lend their
material aid to the fire fighters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Surely you will not think of starting off again
till break of day,” the big man with the white
head of hair, evidently the rancher himself, was
saying, while engaged in pumping the hands of
the two who had dropped down from the sky,
as it were, to bring warning of the burning roof,
and start the stiff fight against the greedy flames
that had ended so successfully. “Stay and eat
breakfast with us, strangers; we’d like to know
you both some better, and have a chance to thank
you most heartily.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unfortunately we must be on our way, neighbor,”
Jack told him. “It happens we are on
special duty, and delay might upset certain plans
we are bent on following out. It was just by
sheer accident we discovered the fire, and took
the customary means for attracting attention that
all air pilots employ; but some other day, if we
chance to be in this neighborhood, we’d be
pleased to see more of you all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The women added their voices to the pressing
invitation, but Jack was forced to decline, although
doing so smilingly, since he would have
liked very much to see more of these warm-hearted
stockmen and their wild riders, possibly
picking up some useful knowledge concerning
the way a ranch is run in these modern days, so
different from early times in the cattle country.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is absolutely necessary for us to be going,”
Jack told them all, “if we are lucky enough to
be able to hop-off again. Perk, I wish you’d
take a look over toward the west, and see if the
ground is fairly clear; while I talk for a few
more minutes with our new friends here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was astute enough to avoid giving their
names to any one but the ranchman, who readily
promised not to mention them to a living soul;
he felt heavily indebted to Jack and his chum,
and considered that they knew their business
best—for one thing he felt absolutely certain the
fact of their being in such a hurry had nothing
whatever to do with any unlawful act on their
part—he had as much confidence in them as
though Jack had actually confided the fact of
their being Government Secret Service agents,
bound on a mission fraught with much peril to
life and limb, the prime object of which was to
save honest people from being victimized by a
gang of unprincipled sharks, makers of clever
bank notes that were without the pale of the
law and only base counterfeits, although clever
imitations of the genuine bills.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVI <br /> <br />IN THE GRIP OF THE STORM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Perk soon afterwards showed up, and seemed
so cheerful that it was evident his little scouting
mission had yielded favorable results.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems okay to me, partner!” he burst out
with, as soon as she came along; “course it ain’t
just as smooth as some fields we know but there
ain’t goin’ to be any smart trouble takin’ off, I
guess now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And are we holding the nose of the ship
straight in line of the course you took a squint
at, Perk?” Jack asked, as he prepared to climb
into his seat, the people of the ranch clustering
around, to gaze with wide open eyes at the fleet
aircraft, some of them doubtless seeing such a
modern cloud clipper for the first time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dead ahead, boss, an’ you’ll strike the right
racket, I’m tellin’ you,” came the positive assurance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then jump aboard, comrade, and we’ll put
it to the test,” saying which Jack himself climbed
into the waiting cockpit, to settle down in his
accustomed seat, take a quick glance at his dials
when the small light was turned on, and await
a signal from the other sky traveler that he was
“fixed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The way was clear, and the fact that just then
the gay old moon condescended to poke her smiling
face out from behind a mass of clouds assisted
more or less in giving the pilot some of the
necessary illumination—the rest must be left to
his native sagacity and instinct.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a bunch of cottonwoods at some
little distance ahead, the location of which Perk
had pointed out to his mate before settling down
in his seat but if all went well Jack calculated
to be able to clear them in good shape—did it
seem necessary he could swerve slightly to the
right, and have a clear field for the take-off.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a little shouting as the friendly
plane started to taxi along, but of course this was
smothered by the increasing roar of exhaust and
spinning propeller. Faster and faster they scurried
onward, and then started to rise on an angle
just sufficient to nicely clear the tops of the cottonwoods;
when Jack jazzed his motor, to find
it running as “sweet as a purring cat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So they departed only a short time after making
that landing which humanity had demanded
and in times to come the little episode was
likely to afford both aviators more or less satisfaction,
in that they had “seen their duty and
done it,” as Perk would say in his whimsical
way.</p>

<p class='c013'>As they continued on their way Perk found
himself wondering if this interesting adventure
was destined to be a sample of other equally
thrilling happenings in store for them the further
they dipped into the great game that had been
laid at their door by the powers that be at Washington.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whenever he came to thinking of the audacity
shown by Slippery Slim in virtually defying all
the authority of the Government, Perk would
feel his dander rising as if in great indignation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh!” he at one time told himself, being
rather fond of thus communing, as his thoughts
ran on, “we’ll call <i>his</i> bluff just the same, the
scaly ol’ gila monster, you wait an’ see. Thinks
he’s the whole works, the boss man-handler, does
he, just ’cause he’s outguessed a number o’ the
boys. This time he’s due to find himself up
against guys o’ the right size, who’ll jerk him
down off’n his high perch in a jiffy, or I miss
my ticket.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk kept on boasting in his customary
fashion, possibly to keep his mind on the subject.
Jack was paying little attention to side issues
just then for he knew his pal’s peculiarities, and
short-comings as well and having “exhausted
his boiler” Perk presently lapsed into utter
silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had climbed to a fairly high ceiling, and
caught only occasional fugitive glimpses of the
earth far below, when the moon chanced to break
through the banks of clouds, which intervals
became less and less frequent, Jack noticed.</p>

<p class='c013'>He did not altogether fancy the looks of the
heavens, by degrees becoming more and more
overcast; still, this might after all mean next to
nothing and their business was to keep steadily
on their way as if things were bound to come out
all right.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was now drawing well on toward midnight,
and they had placed hundreds of miles between
the city of their recent stay and themselves. Long
since Perk had taken what proved to be his last
glimpse of the vast gulf as seen far away toward
the south, when the night was brightly illuminated,
with the moon’s silvery rays shining on the
glistening waters, and making a picture that
even appealed to Perk’s rugged nature—after
that all he was able to make out was the monotonous
level plains that lay in every quarter,
as though the whole earth consisted of this same
stock country.</p>

<p class='c013'>No longer were they able to find any cheer in
the company of the moon, for the canopy above,
earlier in the night peopled by a multitude of
bright stars, was now gripped in dense masses
of clouds.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having thus lost his guide marks below, Jack
was compelled to place all dependence upon his
faithful instruments, but this of course was an
old story to one of his experience, so that he did
not do any worrying on that score.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, buried in his own thoughts, and paying
scant heed to what changes were taking place
in the signs of the weather, had no warning until
suddenly there came a dazzling flash, that was
almost instantly succeeded by a tremendous burst
of thunder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ginger pop! that means we’re booked for a
bit o’ storm, mebbe, eh, Jack?” was his startled
exclamation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s hope it turns out to be <i>only</i> a bluster,”
the pilot went on to say, as he turned the nose of
his ship upward, and commenced to climb, evidently
in hopes that by so doing they might get
above those low hanging clouds, and have clear
sailing while the disturbance lasted.</p>

<p class='c013'>When shortly afterwards a second electrical
crash almost stunned them by its violence, Perk
began to fumble for his oilskin coat, which he
was never without when aboard a boat with an
open cockpit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk could take a ducking with as much good
nature as the next fellow but just the same he
did not intend to get soaked if he could help it,
since a continuance of the flight, with a cold wind
likely to follow the rain, would not prove to be
the most delightful experience possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>No sooner had he accomplished the job of
securing his raincoat than he gave Jack the well
known signal that he meant to take over the
stick, and thus allow his comrade to also protect
himself against bad weather.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly both of them were presently thus
equipped, and ready to take whatever might be
in the offing. Meanwhile the ascent was continued
in spasms, for there was always a chance
of getting above such a storm, and avoiding the
worst of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The thunder claps became more frequent, and
also much louder, so that each sudden burst gave
them both a thrill, death seemed so close, for
should their speeding ship chance to attract one
of those dazzling bolts it would be all over for
the daring air adventurers, and no one be the
wiser concerning their taking-off, until possibly
after long months had passed, their bleached
bones might be discovered by some party of
plainsmen out looking for rustlers or seeking to
round up missing stock.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus far not a single drop of rain had fallen,
according to Perk’s calculations but the coming
of the drenching flood could not be much longer
delayed, he felt positive. Had there not been
so much racket around them those keen ears of
his might have detected a rushing sound in the
near distance, like the roar of the incoming tide
on the sandy shores of the gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then it came with a swoop, the wind whistling
around their ears and the rain beating a tattoo
against the fuselage of the ship, as well as striking
them smartly in the face, despite such protection
as their helmets and heavy goggles afforded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack certainly had his hands full in managing
the bobbing, shifting craft, gripped by those
shifty gusts that came with giant force, making
the flyers feel as though they were clinging to a
mere chip tossed about in the wild fury of a
Texas tempest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Time and again did Perk feel as though his
heart had jumped up in his throat, almost choking
him; seasoned veteran at this sort of thing
as he believed himself to be, he could not help
this feeling of helplessness in the hands of the
aroused elements; yet each time Jack managed
to bring their ship through the teeth of the storm
in a way that was next door to miraculous, and
if Perk had up to this time not fully appreciated
the astonishing skill and confidence of his younger
companion while at the controls in an emergency,
he certainly was getting his lesson then and
there, in a way to cause it to sink deep, and stick.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch17' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVII <br /> <br />A FIGHT WELL WON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was no longer possible for the busy pilot to
keep on his course. Every minute of his time
was taken up with a desperate effort to keep
from being thrown into a nose dive, that, unless
miraculously conquered, would be likely to
send them whirling down, to crash from a five
thousand foot ceiling, and thus bring about a
complete writeoff.</p>

<p class='c013'>That however was the least of Jack’s worries—all
he asked was the ability and luck to be
able to fend off threatening disaster; could this
be done successfully in good time they could
pick up all that was lost, and once more continue
their westward flight.</p>

<p class='c013'>The battering they endured was simply tremendous,
and Jack marveled at the ship being
able to withstand such a horrible strain. If
but a single strut gave way under all that pounding
it would mean starting a series of similar
mishaps such as would quickly render them incapable
of keeping aloft; and with this threat
hanging over their heads it can readily be understood
neither of the two could be in a comfortable
frame of mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still it is wonderful how men thus threatened
will continue to carry on, although in an almost
mechanical fashion, doing just the necessary
thing with each change of pace on the part of
the tricky storm, and meeting successfully every
near tragedy as it arises to clutch them in its
grip.</p>

<p class='c013'>No longer did Jack keep on climbing—it
seemed to him that the further the staggering
boat lifted the more dangerous became their
situation for the air was surcharged with electricity
as the zigzag lightning darted from cloud
to cloud, doubling the chances of their frail
craft being struck.</p>

<p class='c013'>In fact it seemed so terrible above that he
lacked the nerve to persist in the upward work,
and even commenced to drop down. Perk
noticing this move, hardly knew what to make
of it. He was, as he himself would have expressed
it, “hanging on by his teeth,” in order
to keep his seat in the wildly plunging airship
and on finding that the bold pilot had given up
hope of finding relief in the upper regions, the
fact appalled him. Could it be Jack had decided
to attempt a landing, with only the glare
of those repeated electrical flashes to serve as
airport lights? That indeed would be next to
admitting their case as hopeless, and that Jack
was taking such desperate chances only as a last
resort.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were zooming along all this time as if
pursued by a jinx and indeed with such weird
accompaniments it would not be hard to believe
the spirit of the storm took on the part of such a
goblin of the air, to pursue relentlessly this bold
invader of the home of the aroused elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk hit the bullseye close to the center when
afterwards, in describing their experience on
this night of the great blow, he vowed they were
“playing dice with death,” since it seemed a bare
chance that they could ever pull through alive.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such is the life of the aviator—one hour sailing
smoothly along, at peace with all mankind,
envying no man his following, and feeling himself
to be on the top of the world—the next and
he may be fighting with might and main the
mad demons of the air, his life hanging in the
balance, his strength ebbing fast, and unless the
little cherub aloft that is said to be watching
over each sailor, whether of the sea or the limitless
air, comes to the rescue, his fate is sealed,
and another modern Argonaut never comes back
again to the home port.</p>

<p class='c013'>It did not seem to be any the less exciting even
when they had succeeded in gaining a much
lower altitude; although possibly the danger
from those thunderbolts might have been somewhat
abated. Perk soon realized that his pilot
had no intention of trying for a landing in the
midst of such a turmoil and confusion, which
fact relieved his harried feelings to some extent.
Indeed, it would have been a mad proceeding,
and almost unheard of, since hardly the slightest
chance offered for the most skillful pilot to
reach the earth without disaster, such as making
a ground loop, and having the heavy engine bury
them under its weight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk endeavored to convince himself that
things were a bit easier since a lower altitude
had been effected but in so doing he feared he
was only deceiving himself—if anything at all
things were even worse,—although the drop
might not be so far, which was small comfort,
since it must mean their complete annihilation
if it befell them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had numerous spasms when he fancied
something was going amiss with their staunch
craft, although unable to decide the exact nature
of the imaginary trouble. Despite all these
chills, which must have been the products of his
excitement, they managed to hold out minute
after minute, which fact gave more or less cause
for renewed hope.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack must indeed be almost completely exhausted,
and yet he refused to give up the controls,
to which his hands seemed glued as though
riveted there. Perk punched his side numbers
of times, but could get no favorable response,
proving that the other deemed it too hazardous
a proceeding to change possession of the stick
while in the whirl of that shrieking gale—which
was indeed only another adaptation of the old
proverb “it is folly to change horses when crossing
a stream.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no means for communication with
each other, even though they may have wished
to do so, since the ear-phones had been discarded
with the donning of their slickers, and
could not be put back in position, owing to the
sudden bursting of the storm, and the necessity
for employing their hands in more useful pursuits.</p>

<p class='c013'>All Perk could do was to hang on, keeping
himself ready to seize hold should his companion
be suddenly compelled to release his grip
through sheer weariness—that, and keeping tabs
of the weather, so as to glean the first favorable
sign that came along, promising a let-up, or at
least a break.</p>

<p class='c013'>Judging from the heavy rain that had come
down in such a solid stream it must be reckoned
one of those dreadful cloud-bursts of which he,
Perk, had so often heard, but which thus far in
his experience he had never met up with. No
doubt rivers would be out of their beds long before
dawn although that angle of the situation
did not interest them in the least, since their
traveling would not be interfered with a particle,
if only the air proved inviting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yes, soon Perk believed he could detect a lessening
of the baffling crosswinds that had been
so trying to the pilot, keeping him continually
on the anxious seat—then, too, it struck him the
floods were growing weaker in the bargain;
which two facts gave poor Perk a feeling akin to
joy in the region of his heart, such as he may
have known on previous occasions, but that must
have been far down in his adventurous past.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to their altimeter they were something
like two thousand feet from the ground,
but of course never the faintest glimpse could
they secure of what lay beneath them, so poor
was the visibility, with all that torrent of water
pouring down as might a mountain cataract.</p>

<p class='c013'>This delightful feeling grew stronger as minutes
passed—at this rate he would soon be able
to influence tired Jack to renounce his frozen
hold on the stick, and turn the handling of the
ship over to his chum.</p>

<p class='c013'>In this frame of mind he again nudged the
other, but in turn received a negative shake of
the head, which meant there was “nothing doing”—in
other words, since the storm still raged,
even though in somewhat diminished violence,
they must not be too premature, and spoil it all
just when the victory seemed about to drop into
their hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>With what Perk hoped would prove to be a
last dying spurt the rain came pelting down,
after which it suddenly stopped as though an
unseen hand away up among the clouds, had
plugged the gap, and kept any more water from
running out—enough was enough, surely, Perk
was telling himself when he made this thrilling
discovery and for one he felt he had had sufficient
rain to last him the balance of that year.</p>

<p class='c013'>So too did the wind start to diminish its force,
also coming from one direction with more constancy—some
relief to Jack, that was certain,
since now he could know just how to steer his
turbulent craft so as to meet the force driving
against it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then what did Perk do but start getting his
ear-phones adjusted, being wild to hear a human
voice, after all that fiendish roaring and howling
kicked up by the raging elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>Why, already the atmosphere had cleared
enough for him to catch faint glimpses of what
lay beneath them—it looked as though they had
come to a stretch of country where the level
prairie had changed into rougher ground, with
deep swales, sometimes running into quite respectable
ravines and there were indications of
ridges ahead, which might even prove to be
fairly high, so that it would have been tempting
Providence had Jack dropped still lower, while
flying blind through all that welter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Talk to me ’bout luck,” the grateful Perk
was saying to himself, “I never ran ’cross anything
like <i>this</i>—they told me Jack must a been
born under a lucky star, an’ now I sure b’lieves
it to be the right stuff they were givin’ me, an’
no taffy either. But that was some fight, take
it from me, fellers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards Jack condescended to give
him the sign that he was willing to pass up the
job; whereat Perk quickly superseded him as
pilot, and saw the other sink back in his cramped
quarters as though unable to hold up his tired
arms a second longer. Apparently the relief
had come not a minute too soon, for he must have
been close to the point of utter exhaustion after
so long and violent a strain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Battered as the crate had been while the gale
lashed them so madly, it had stood up under the
buffeting most amazingly and Perk would
never have occasion to utter anything saving
words of praise for the model and its makers;
it must be as near perfection as aircraft are being
built these days of man’s victory over the
savage forces of the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Setting his course in what he believed to be the
proper direction Perk waited until Jack seemed
fairly well recovered, when he was pleased to
see the other take up his head harness as though
he too felt the necessity for opening up communications
with his running mate, which outlook
gratified Perk immensely.</p>

<p class='c013'>There were many things he wished to have
made clear, and besides, he felt more than curious
to learn what Jack’s next move might turn
out to be—that they had drifted far from their
original course went without saying but a means
must be found to recover the lost ground, after
which they could take up the game again just
where the sudden storm had caused such a diversion.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then the moon peeped out through a
break in the clouds overhead, as though to tell
them it was all over, with decent weather once
more in the offing.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch18' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVIII <br /> <br />THE DESERTED SHACK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Well, that’s somehow I guess over, and I’m
mighty glad,” was the way Perk voiced his feelings,
when the clouds were rolling away, and the
heavenly host of stars backed up the moon in
lighting up the firmament.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Same here,” echoed Jack, still more or less
tired after his energetic battle with the unleashed
elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And strikes me the air’s got some chilly,”
added the other; “I own up I’m shivering to
beat the band right now. Where d’ye figger we
might be, partner—must a lost our course in all
that kettle o’ rain an’ wind, an’ drifted far to
the south, eh, what, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question about it, Perk; I could feel the
pull right along; still, there wasn’t a thing to do
but let the old crate take the reins in her teeth.
Once morning comes we’ll manage somehow to
get a line on our locality, and swing back to our
course.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some hours off yet,” ventured Perk, whose
lips were indeed trembling, as if the chill was
beginning to get in its work—perhaps all that
recent excitement was helping to make him
shiver, as it often will, even in the case of the
most valiant of men.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack noticed this fact, even though he himself
experienced nothing similar, for some reason or
other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Perk, you ought to have a chance
to sit alongside a warm fire and dry off; the rain
must have got under your slicker, and I reckon
now you’re slopping around in water back there.
Something’s <i>got</i> to be done about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! boss, don’t bother ’bout me; I’m a
hard-shell you must know, an’ a little dampness
ain’t agoin’ to do me any harm, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just the same we’ll try and make a landing,”
continued the other, “if there’s half a chance;
all I’d want would be to stack up against a level
stretch of upland, where the drainage had carried
off all that flood.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, that sounds all to the good, boy but
what difference will it make, I want to know?
After such a storm it’s bound to be some cold
even away down here along the Texas-Arizona
line; they call them Northers, jest like I’ve heard
they do down in Florida. Forget it, partner—I’m
a tough guy, an’ ain’t wantin’ to be coddled
like a baby.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just the same I say we’re going to land, if
half a chance shows up,” affirmed the pilot, in
that set way of his. “We’ll find the stuff to build
some sort of fire, Perk, where you could make
a pot of hot coffee; which’d do you more good
than a switch of hard liquor. Put that in your
pipe and smoke it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk remained silent for almost two whole
minutes, during which time no doubt he was
revolving in his mind what Jack had proposed—in
imagination he could almost <i>smell</i> the delicious
aroma of the coffee, boiling so merrily
over the red coals and even feel a joyous sensation
of warmth stealing through his chilled body.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Okay, Jack; you win, hands down. Me for
the coffee every time, to be followed by a quiet
smoke o’ my fav’rite brand o’ tobac. Have your
own way about it, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then get ready to try and make out what
sort of ground we’ll soon be passing over,” added
Jack, as he turned the ship earthward, and slid
down on a long glide, with the motor clamped
shut. “We’ll skim along close enough for you
to get a good idea as to how matters stand, and
yet giving enough distance to keep clear of any
clump of trees, or little bald knobs of rises.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently Perk assured him he could manage
to get fair glimpses at what lay below; at which
Jack again started on an even keel, moving with
as little speed as was compatible with safety.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not very long before the watcher gave
tongue.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Looks good to me down yonder, partner—guess
now we might make a safe an’ sane landin’—’specially
with <i>you</i> at the stick. Circulate
a little bit to the south, brother, ’cause it looks
some better thataways.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This Jack did, and then at another signal from
the observer, he proceeded to drop down with
almost as much confidence as he might have felt
when making a landing on Candler Field, well
lighted, and with every convenience suited to
safety and comfort.</p>

<p class='c013'>His confidence, it seemed, had not been misplaced,
for they effected a very fair contact, all
things considered, even though the landing was
somewhat “joggly and rough” as Perk expressed
it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once the ship came to a stop and both of them
hastened to clamber out of their close quarters—“cribbed,
cabined and confined,” Jack sometimes
liked to say in connection with their limited
cockpit, although his pal always reminded him
of the fact that <i>cabin</i> was something only conspicuous
by its absence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk’s first movement was to start threshing
his arms against his thighs with more or less
vigor, in which he showed good common sense
since there is no better method for stirring up
sluggish circulation after a long period of inaction.
Jack on his part commenced to check
up on certain sections of the undergear, meaning
to make certain he had done no damage in making
connection with the earth under such unfavorable
conditions.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything in ship-shape, I reckon, Perk,”
he announced. “And now let’s make out to find
something in the line of trees, where we might
pick up enough wood for that fire.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Looks kinder like things’d be mighty well
soaked after all that downpour,” affirmed the
shrewd Yankee-Canadian; “so it’d be a tough
job coaxin’ stuff to take fire. But wait a minute,
partner—I didn’t get a chance to tell you that I
spied what looked like an ol’ tumbledown shack
over to windward—I guess now it might be
abandoned, but just the same, partner, we’d be
apt to run across some dry wood inside.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suppose you step over and take a look-in,
Perk,” suggested the other. “I’ll stand by the
crate here, and keep our little glim working, so
you’ll get your bearings when you start back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, Jack,” acceded the lanky one,
always eager for any sort of service; “an’ by the
same token now I’ll tote my gun along—never
c’n tell what sorter game you’ll stack up against
on these here Texas plains, I’m told. I feel like
I could knock over a wolf er two, just to get my
blood to movin’ at a faster clip—how ’bout it,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suit yourself, Perk,” he was told, as Jack
climbed back into the cockpit so as to manipulate
the light he mentioned, and which would prove
sufficient to serve the wanderer as a beacon when
wishing to retrace his steps.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly Perk wandered off, having decided
as to the quarter where he had glimpsed
what looked like an old and lonely shack or
cabin, faintly seen in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>He came back in a short time, bubbling over
with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all right, Jack—just like I guessed, it
turned out to be an ownerless shack but the roof
looks like it might’ve shed the rain, an’ oh! boy!
heaps o’ dry wood inside, with a whoppin’ big
fireplace where you could slap on the biggest
log agoin’. Mebbe I ain’t glad you thought o’
this game. Come along, an’ we’ll fetch the stuff
for a warm snack—coffee, crackers, an’ bacon
in the bargain. Talk to me about luck, it’s comin’
to us in big chunks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! we’ve got to get used to that sort of
thing,” said Jack, in the most matter-of-fact tone
imaginable; “when you’re on such a wonderful
lay as this anything’s likely to happen, and all
kinds of surprises spring out at you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder,” was all Perk could say in reply;
but he lost no time in gathering together such
articles as aluminum coffeepot, skillet, cups, and
such other things as he knew would be needed to
complete their little midnight spread.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon it’s safe for us to leave our crate
off here,” remarked the cautious Jack, “but I’ll
fix things so no busybody can take-off while we’re
away,” which he did without any trouble; after
which they both set out to move along to the
deserted shack Perk had located, lying right
there, just as if a favoring Fate had designed it
for their especial benefit in an emergency, as
the grateful Perk told himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Arriving at the humble shack, that once may
have housed a happy family in days that were
gone, they made use of Jack’s electric torch in
order to gather some dry splinters of wood,
which, heaped above some paper on the open
hearth, soon blazed up, and afforded them an
opportunity to take a look around.</p>

<p class='c013'>Other fuel more lasting was hurriedly added
to the fire, and this done the two air adventurers
took stock of their surroundings. There was
nothing much to see, since the shack happened
to be entirely devoid of any kind of furniture,
even of the most primitive make; but the roof
had stood the ravages of time, and promised to
hold out for years still to come.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk held out his chilled hands to the blaze
but only for a few minutes; apparently the possibility
of brewing some “nectar” was an overpowering
temptation, for presently he started to
work.</p>

<p class='c013'>In short order he had the steam coming out
of the coffee pot spout, and a most delightful
odor permeated the interior of that ancient
shack. When the coffee was ready, Perk poured
some of the amber fluid in both aluminum cups,
and offered Jack one, together with a freshly
opened carton of tempting crackers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goes right to the spot,” the self-made <i>chef</i>
observed, rubbing a hand across his stomach, as
though experiencing the most blissful sensation
there; “best coffee I ever tasted, barrin’ none,
an’ say, I’ve tried it a good many places like
France and Germany, as well as in Turkey too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Same here,” Jack assured him, as he drained
his first cup. “By the way, didn’t you say you’d
fetched some bacon along over here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jest what I did, partner, an’ now I’ve had
my fust swaller o’ coffee I’ll get a move on an’
soon have some o’ the same asizzlin’ in the pan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He started to carry out his words, with the
interested Jack watching his efforts to try and
make the frying pan set evenly on the fire, a feat
that requires considerable knowledge of camp
tactics in order to be successful. After one near
spill, with Perk only saving an upset by quick
work, Jack modestly broke in to give a bit of
advice, not forgetting, however, that old saying
about “too many cooks spoil the broth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too hot to keep hold of the handle looks like,
partner; now if only we were outdoors we might
find stones enough to form some sort of foundation
on three sides of the fire, where you could
rest your pan. Hold on, here’s this old hearth
that was made of some kind of Mexican bricks—adobe
they call them and it looks to me like
some of ’em might be loose. Here, I’ll manage to
pry a few up for you, Perk, old man—just hold—your—horses
and——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did not finish his sentence, and the cook,
glancing up to see what ailed him, found his
pal holding the first adobe in an uplifted hand,
while he was himself staring hard into the cavity
from which it had come, as if he saw something
wonderfully fascinating there!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch19' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIX <br /> <br />FORTUNE KNOCKS AT THE DOOR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“I swan! what’s the matter, partner—my
sakes; is it a <i>rattler</i> you uncovered, I wanter
know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk on his part was already sharing the excitement
of his pal, although apparently from
an entirely different reason. He had already
started to scramble to his knees, being doubtless
bent on taking some aggressive action, when he
saw Jack reach forward and deliberately pluck
some object from the hole under the displaced
adobe fire brick, and hold it up to view.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he saw its nature Perk’s jaw dropped, and
he was the picture of abject astonishment—but
it was far from being any poisonous reptile that
Jack was thus exhibiting with such a grand
flourish; just as though he might be some necromancer
or magician, and drawing all manner of
amazing things out of an apparently empty
stove-pipe hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gosh-a-mighty! that looks like real money!
I swan!” burst from Perk’s lips, as he continued
to stare.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just what it’s supposed to be, Pal Perk,”
said Jack, trying to keep his own voice from
displaying a genuine tremolo—“a neat wad of
it, waiting here for us to drop in and pick it up.
Seems like things might be set up, like tenpins
in the alley, for two lucky dogs to knock down
with a couple of rolled balls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If that don’t beat anything I ever did see,”
continued the astounded Perk, now grinning, as
though the pleasant nature of their find was
commencing to appeal to him. “Jest think o’ a
pair o’ air tramps ahappenin’ along, runnin’
across this here deserted shack, an’ findin’ a fortune
askin’ to be taken care of—don’t it beat the
Dutch what c’n happen—Arabian Night’s adventures
can’t hold a candle to the real thing in
these modern days. Some ol’ miser musta hid
that boodle under the bricks, so’s to keep the
Mex raiders comin’ up over the international
border from gettin’ their itchin’ fingers on it—how
’bout that, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Off color, I’m afraid, Perk,” Jack told him,
after taking a quick look at his wonderful find
in the hearth <i>cache</i>; “that miser story might go
with some but it doesn’t wash with me worth
a red cent. In the first place if this money had
been hidden here by a miser, he’d have taken it
away with him when he cut stick. Then again
it would surely have been partly in hard cash,
like gold eagles, and such stuff—all hoards of
misers, you remember, are made up like that,
Perk, and when you give this the once-over
you’ll also notice how it’s all in bills, mostly
fresh ones at that, as if they hadn’t seen much
circulation, as you might say.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk drew in a long breath, and continued to
stare hard at the object Jack was holding out in
front of him; it might be that something in the
other’s words and manner suggested certain possibilities
that seemed almost too staggering for
poor Perk to digest offhand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gee whittiker jewsharps! Jack—what’s this
you’re hintin’ at, ol’ pal—give it to me easy-like,
so I c’n swaller it—all in bills—mostly
fresh ones at that—not seen much handlin’
around—say, are you tryin’ to tell me they’re
every one five dollar bills,—Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon that’s what they are, Perk, I’d say,
from taking a quick look at the same.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bad currency—counterfeits—bogus stuff, er—what?”
gasped the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look for yourself, and you’ll recognize them
as having been printed from the same plates as
the one we’re carrying with us as a sample of
Slippery Slim’s best work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Je-ru-salem crickets! I’m knocked silly for
a fact,” whimpered Perk; and then, as if mustering
up his vanishing stamina he went on to add:
“but however could they’ve got right there under
that brick—conjurer’s black magic, looks
like to me, partner, it sure does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nonsense! that part of it is easy enough to
figure out,” asserted Jack, as usual very matter-of-fact;
“the only thing that seems to border on
the miraculous is our running across this packet
of all the people in the Far West—it looks to
me as if some sort of Destiny might be handling
the cards—that all we have to do is to keep moving
and everything’s bound to come our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure does seem like a snap, and that’s a fact,”
agreed Perk, calming down a little as he began
to grow more accustomed to the great discovery
that had resulted from their deciding to drop
down, and have a sociable cup of hot coffee;
“but I’ll be danged if I c’n make head or tail
out o’ this happening—now, what under the sun
did anybody want to stick that wad o’ long green
under the same adobes, I’d like to know, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! there might be any number of answers
to that question, Perk; for instance didn’t we
learn that it was the habit of Slim, or one of his
busy bees, to jump across the border every little
while with a load of the flimsy, and dole the stuff
out to a number of agents he has working with
him in this section of the country, also all the
way over to Los Angeles and San Diego?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was the spiel they gave us, for a fact,
boss,” admitted Perk, wagging his head eagerly,
as though he felt certain clever Jack would be
able to figure things out, and hit on some sort of
explanation that would cover these mysterious
happenings.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, this, then, might be one of his hidden
<i>caches</i>—at certain times this unknown agent
hides some <i>real</i> money in such a hole as this, and
comes along another dark night it might be to
pick up the big wad that was left in exchange
for the small one he contributed. And that is
the way the game runs, so I was told.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“By gum! but what grand luck for us to come
in on this deal, Jack—pretty soft, I’d call it,
and neither of us had any hand in it either—just
hit on this little bank by sheer chance! Goin’
to crib the loot, are you, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack scratched his head as though certain
plans were flitting through it, and he must make
a choice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, we have to start somewhere, you understand,
Perk, and it looks like the finger of
Fate might be pointing right at this shack, and
telling us to get busy and pick up a strong clue
that, if followed up, would take us straight to
that hideout Slim’s got across in Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess I see what you mean now, brother,”
ventured Perk, his face lighting up with extreme
joy; for he felt they were already on the track,
and that from that hour there must be rapid
action continuously. “If so be that ’ere critter
that slams out these bills on greenhorns and
come-ons is gettin’ anxious to see what sorter
prize he’s drawn in the lottery, why, he might
jest come along any ol’ time now, since the
storm’s over an’ there’s nawthin’ to hold him up.
Got any idea he’s nigh due here, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shouldn’t be a bit surprised if he walked in
on us any time,” ventured Jack; and then, seeing
the puzzled look on his chum’s rugged face
he went on to add: “I didn’t mention the fact
but while we were making our way over from
the ship I felt certain I glimpsed several far-off
lights, as if they might be in windows of cabins
or houses of some sort. Then, too, I surely did
hear a big dog barking, and something like a
rooster crowing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I’ll be jiggered if you ain’t got sharper
ears than I c’n boast, Jack, ol’ hoss, which ain’t
no lie either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t you believe it, Perk; it just happened
that you were so wrapped up in thinking of that
coffee treat you didn’t pay as much attention to
outside things as I did. So it seems as if there
might be some kind of a village or prairie town
not more than two miles from this abandoned
old shack and if that’s so then the chances are
this agent who’s been working the public for
Slim probably lives there. Then again, like as
not he has a pretty good idea about when his
bunch of kale ought to be placed under that
brick—in fact he might have made his way out
here this very night only for the storm threatening.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, partner,” Perk hastened to say, brimful
of energy, “which, bein’ the case, it’s up to
us to lay a sweet little mantrap, so’s to trip him
by the heels if so be he knocks on our door.
How’ll we fetch it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“First of all we’ll finish our supper, and clean
up here,” came the ready explanation; “he may
smell the odor of coffee and bacon, but then you
might expect this shelter to be used once in a
while by Mexican tramps, or passing cowboys,
especially when a big storm threatens, so that
isn’t going to scare the Johnny. As for us, we’ll
fix things so as to give him a nice little surprise,
by hiding out, after making things all dark inside
here, with water thrown on the fire to
smother the hot coals, after which there’s nothing
to do but take things easy until he shows up—if
he does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sabbe, okay, partner; let’s get busy, for
the bacon’s done brown to a turn.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch20' class='c014'>CHAPTER XX <br /> <br />SPRINGING THE TRAP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There was much that must be done before they
could feel satisfied they had their mantrap arranged.
Jack realized that if the party who
played the part of local agent for the counterfeiter
gang had been kept from coming to secure
the fresh supply of bogus bills by the threatening
storm, he was likely to make his appearance
at almost any time, since all danger from the
electrical disturbance was now past.</p>

<p class='c013'>They finished their little supper without
wasting any more time, after which the matter
of hiding all traces of their presence was taken
up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See if you can find any water outdoors,
Perk,” Jack was saying, as he contemplated the
red embers of their late fire. “Seems to me I
stepped in some sort of a puddle while coming
up to the door. Here’s an old rusty can that
looks as if it’d hold a quantity—I want to dash
it on these coals so as to cool them off. That
done we’ll find some way to hide, and watch developments.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk sized up the situation cleverly enough,
and lost no time in setting about doing as his pal
suggested. When he came back he was carrying
the rusty can, which did leak a trifle, but
then that made no particular difference, so long
as enough water remained to put the fire out.</p>

<p class='c013'>It sizzled, and steamed a bit but Perk distributed
the fluid contents of his can with such
discretion that all this was speedily brought to
a finish, with the last red ember cooled off, leaving
a dead little pile of wood ashes as the only
reminder of their blaze.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now that’s settled, partner,” said the always
ready Perk, “what comes next on our program?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had his hand electric torch in use, for
otherwise they must have been left to grope
around, since the clouds continued to drift past
in clusters, shutting out most of the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We must gather up everything here that
might give us away, for like as not the fellow’ll
fetch some kind of a light along with him—lantern
it may turn out to be, because he knows its
apt to be pretty dark inside the old shack, and
he can’t do much just by fumbling around.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! that’s right, boss,” returned Perk,
commencing to gather up any and all their
scanty belongings, not forgetting that convenient
rifle of his. “But I say, how ’bout the bus—won’t
he lamp the thing settin’ there in the open
an’ ain’t it apt to give him a bad start?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had duly considered that very point in
making up his plans, and was ready to meet the
situation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Taken it all in all, buddy, there’s small danger
of that happening,” he went on to tell Perk.
“First, remember, the ship lies on that side of
the shack away from the spot where I glimpsed
those lights and if he comes along in a direct
line from the town there isn’t one chance in three
of him noticing it. Even if he does I reckon
he’ll feel dead certain only his own messenger’d
be flying in this region—he may never have seen
another crate besides the one sent out by Slippery
Slim.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She sounds good to me, Jack an’ I’m willin’
to take a shy at the target, if so be you guess it’s
straight goods, all wool’n a yard wide. Let’s
go!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly both passed out of the deserted
shack that had proved such a fortunate harbor
for them after the late storm. Jack knew what
they must do in following up the little plan he
had framed, with a view of giving the suspect
the shock of his life and without any further
preliminaries he set about carrying out the few
details.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a chink or two in this further wall,”
he went on to say, in a low voice, next door to a
whisper, “that will furnish us means for keeping
tabs on what’s going on inside. We’ll settle down
there, and just wait. As luck has it that side of
the shack is away from the moon, which is all in
our favor, in fact everything seems to be arranged
just to suit our plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bully set-up, boss, couldn’t be better for a
fact,” agreed the hopeful Perk, who firmly believed
in the element of Luck, and was immensely
gratified to discover how that little god
was working over-time in their favor—according
to his way of thinking it was always “better
to be born lucky than rich.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it?” whispered Jack, after they
had commenced to crouch down in the darkened
spot he had selected.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just great, that’s all,” Perk assured him,
“show me where one o’ them cracks c’n be located,
partner, an’ then I’ll be okay—all
fixed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack obliged by directing his chum’s hand to
an opening, through which it would be easy
enough to keep watch over any happening inside
the shack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Next we’ll creep over to this further corner,
and try to find out when he comes along,”
continued Jack. “From now on, Perk, keep
your tongue between your teeth—no talking, remember,
but if it does seem to be absolutely
necessary, put your lips close to my ear, and
whisper—get that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nuff sed, boss, I’m on,” came faintly from
the figure crouching at Jack’s side, after which
abject silence fell upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>A little later on Perk, now that his hearing
was strained so as to pick up any kind of sound,
however slight, caught the barking of a watchdog;
it seemed to be at a considerable distance
from the shack, and he judged there might be a
couple of miles lying between. This was not a
great amount of ground to cover, if only the inducement
were sufficiently urgent and that fat
packet of enticing bank bills, supposed to be
secreted under the adobes of the old hearth, must
represent an alluring prize, capable of drawing
a chap who was fond of “easy money” out of his
snug home at this unseasonable hour of the
night, and indulging in a little hike, for which
effort he would fancy himself well repaid.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some time passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>They lay there just back of the comer of the
dilapidated and abandoned shack, waiting, listening,
and frequently feeling a little thrill when
some soft sound came stealing to their ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Perk plainly heard what was surely a
low cough, such as might be caused by a sudden
tickling in the throat. Some one was undoubtedly
approaching the spot, and coming from the
west, where they understood the prairie hamlet,
or village, lay at the foot of a small ridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>He merely touched his companion’s right arm
to let Jack know something was in the wind.
The cough was repeated, so that Perk chuckled
softly to himself, as if more than ever convinced
that luck was bent on handing them out further
fat plums.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was already creeping back so as to reach
the spot where those convenient peepholes could
be found and of course Perk imitated his example.
Thus it came about they were in complete
readiness to make good use of their eyes
when a slight scratching sound came from
within, and a tiny flash announced that the newcomer
had struck a match.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk could see him there down on his knees,
and intent on applying his lighted match to the
wick of a lantern he had evidently fetched along
for this very purpose. If Perk could have analyzed
the feeling that possessed him just then he
must have compared it to the exultation of a cat
when about to make a jump upon a sparrow,
close up to which he had managed to hide, all
prepared for the finishing act of the ambush.</p>

<p class='c013'>No sooner had the man succeeded in lighting
his lantern than with eager hands he commenced
lifting the adobe under which Jack had again
artfully placed the bait in the shape of that
tempting packet of bogus notes.</p>

<p class='c013'>How eagerly he pounced on the contents of
his queer <i>cache</i>, all the avariciousness of a miser
handling his hoard was displayed and at the
same time he looked hurriedly from one side to
the other, as though his guilty soul, conscious of
having thus broken the law of his country, was
already seeing the long arm of Justice stretching
out menacingly toward him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack evidently had seen enough to satisfy him
the genuine criminal was in focus, and that there
could be no miscarriage of Justice in effecting
his capture with the goods upon him. He was
creeping toward the open door of the shack, evidently
bent on taking the slick partner of the
counterfeiter chief by surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk lost no time in crawling at his pal’s heels,
bent on having a hand in the closing scene of the
little drama—he wanted to see with his own
eyes just how such a slimy beast would take his
“bump” when he found the meshes of the net
closing around him.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon looking in at the open door.
The man still knelt there on the hard earthen
floor of the shack, and appeared to be nervously
fumbling the sheaf of bills, as though trying to
count them, and be assured that he had received
the full amount to which he was entitled—that
there had been no “holdout” attempted.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps one of them happened to make a
slight sound—either that, or else the man’s guilty
soul caused him to fancy he heard something
for he turned his head. It chanced that the
light of the lantern fell full upon his dark face,
and disclosed the distended eyes filled with terror,
as well as the expression so ghastly that
passed athwart his countenance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put ’em up!” commanded Jack, sharply, in
a voice that would brook no nonsense and as if
mechanically influenced to obey, the wretched
trapped distributor of bad notes raised both
hands, the packet falling to the floor as if his
nerveless fingers could no longer retain their
grip.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and Perk stepped blithely into the
lighted shack, the former with his ready automatic
covering the badly shaken rogue, Perk
trailing his rifle in a suggestive way, as if able
to back his boss up on the slightest provocation.</p>

<p class='c013'>First frisking the other, and removing a gun
from his back pocket, Jack made a motion with
his hand as he set Perk to work.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get the bracelets on him, partner, then we’ll
ask him a few leading questions before we make
up our minds what the next step’ll be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But—hold on, Mister,” whined the poor
devil, all aquiver as he groveled there on his
knees; “I ain’t done nawthin’—this hear ain’t
my stuff—I jest suspicioned Jud he must a had
somethin’ hid out this way, ’case he kep’ comin’
an’ agoin’, so I kim tuh see what it mout be. Now
I knows he must a robbed thet bank over in
Tucson when he went off with a gang he runs
with.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stow that gab,” said the disgusted Perk,
“that’s all too flimsy to wash. We got you to
rights an’ where the hair’s short, an’ you’ll have
a chanct to see what the inside o’ the pen at Atlanta’s
like. This here’s counterfeit long-green,
an’ you knows it, mister,” with which cutting
remark he snapped a pair of steel handcuffs
upon the other’s wrists with the skill only one
accustomed to handling such “safety-first” contraptions
could display, proving that for one of
Slippery Slim’s active lieutenants the show was
indeed over.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch21' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXI <br /> <br />PICKING UP CLUES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>By this time the man whom Uncle Sam’s two
clever sky detectives had trapped, showed signs
of being almost in a state of collapse. Too late
did he realize what a terrible mistake he had
made when yielding to the blandishments of
Slippery Slim Garrabrant, and acting under the
belief that he could defy the law and get away
with it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the big idea, partner,” Perk was asking
after he and Jack had fixed things so there
was no possible chance for their prisoner to
break away, and give them the laugh. “Do we
jump off right now, or wait till mornin’, I’d like
to know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No hurry at all,” was the calm reply, “I
want to go over our crate once more before we
start that hop across to the California border,
I’ve good reason to believe things are okay but
a second overhauling will satisfy me better.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I kinder guess you won’t want me to slip
over to this here town, an’ pick up a few fresh
eggs, eh, boss?” and Perk’s voice actually took
on a wheedling vein as he made this remark
for if there was anything he dearly loved along
the line of “eats” it was those same “fresh eggs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack shook his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hardly think it would be wise,” he observed;
“we don’t know the lay of the land for one thing—it
might be this party has some backing among
his neighbors, and we’d find ourselves in a hornets’
nest before we knew what was what. No,
we can stick it out here the balance of the night,
which is pretty well gone right now, and be off
about sunrise.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a lot more stuff around in here that’d
burn right well,” insinuated Perk; “how ’bout
another bit o’ fire—this night air feels some cool
to me an’ ’sides, we’d have a blaze ready so’s to
boil more coffee ’fore we kick off, eh, what,
partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Please yourself so far as that goes, Perk, I
reckon it wouldn’t feel at all bad to have some
fire, as we must hang out here several hours.
But don’t make any noise if you can help it.
Besides, we ought to keep an eye out for trouble,
no telling what this slick chap might work off
on us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! we’ll one o’ us keep watch off’n on,”
promised Perk, starting without any further delay
to gather some fuel, and get a blaze going.</p>

<p class='c013'>While he was thus engaged Jack took their
prisoner in hand, and commenced to grill him.
There was nothing of the dreaded “third degree”
rough-house measures in what Jack attempted
but he tried to show the man where his best interests
lay.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re in a bad fix, my friend,” Jack told
him: “and unless you come clean, so as to help
us round up the balance of your outfit, you’ll
be certain to get the full penalty the law lays
down. We know a whole lot about Slippery
Slim and his ways, and are dead certain we’re
bound to end up his graft before many more
days pass by. So when you’re answering my
questions don’t try to lie to me, for like as not
I’ll be already acquainted with the facts and
know you’re trying to beat around the bush.
Dangerous business, let me tell you; far better
for you to hold your tongue than deceive me.
Come clean, and I promise you I’ll do everything
in my power to have you let off easy, besides no
one need know you’ve turned State’s evidence.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he started in to put pointed questions,
concerning certain points that were vital to his
plans. Once he caught the man squirming under
the lash, and giving an answer that he very well
knew was like “beating around the bush.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know better than that, my friend,” he
told him sharply, “that’s only half a truth you’ve
given me. Don’t try it again if you know what’s
good for your health, or it’ll be a matter of possibly
ten years before you see your family again.
Stick to the truth, and it may be only a question
of six months you’ll spend at Atlanta behind the
bars. Now tell me again what I wanted to know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He had managed to impress his strong personality
upon the writhing wretch, who was
ready to throw himself unreservedly upon his
mercy and so the answers were given without
hesitation, although in some instances the man
declared he did not know, as he had only once
been across the line and visited Slippery Slim
in his hideout among the Mexican mountains.</p>

<p class='c013'>When Jack realized that he had really pumped
the other dry, he felt he had profited in many
ways and that their sudden determination to
make, a night landing, so as to recover after their
buffeting by the storm, had been a most fortunate
happening indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>For one thing he had learned that the name
of their frightened prisoner was Simeon Hawkins,
and that he had a wife and several children
living in the little prairie town only a few miles
distant—a fact that seemed to give him great
distress, now he found his avaricious dreams
wrecked, and himself in the hands of a couple
of those very same Secret Service detectives
whom the “big boss” had undoubtedly referred
to so contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had been “listening in,” and chuckling
happily whenever he realized his mate had made
some sort of a “ten-strike,” picking up valuable
information that was destined to ultimately
serve their ends wonderfully, and help to “pot
their game.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They sat there for some time, talking in low
tones. The man who lay close by helpless was
silent as a rule, although several times he uttered
a dismal groan, when his feelings overpowered
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess I’ll step out, partner,” remarked Perk
at one time, “an’ slip over to the ship, I’d sure
hate to have some critter do us a bad turn by
meddlin’ with any o’ them dials an’ gadgets.
What I wouldn’t do to <i>him</i> would be a caution,
that’s right.”</p>

<p class='c013'>From the fact that Perk carried his rifle along
with him his meaning was not difficult to understand
and Jack felt sorry for the chap who was
at the other end of the gun sights when his pal
pulled the trigger.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk cautiously approached the grounded
ship, and started when discovering some moving
object just in its shadow. The moon was shining
brightly now, so that it was an easy matter to see
for quite some little distance, although so deceptive
was the light that even sharp-eyed Perk
could hardly have told whether some dark object
seen fifty feet off was a stump or a black dog
sitting there and watching him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Waiting until the object moved again, he discovered
he had been wise to hold his fire, for by
then he had made it out to be some species of
animal. He took several forward steps, whereupon
the beast started to move off, uttering a
little nasty snarl while doing so.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks, on’y a stinkin’ kiote after all, skulkin’
’round to see if he c’n stir up a little grub o’ any
kind. Get out, you varmint!” and he waved his
gun above his head while starting to run forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>This completely demoralized the cowardly
prairie marauder, so that he took to his heels,
and quickly vanished in the near distance. Perk
found everything all right when he gave the
stranded plane “the once over”; and being satisfied
that there was nothing to be feared from a
coyote prowling around in search of a supper or
breakfast, he returned to the shack to report all
well.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was busily engaged making certain notes,
and reading others connected with their present
business, as jotted down in his memorandum
book in a peculiar brand of short-hand all his
own, but which would appear as so much Greek
or Choctaw to any one else.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Better turn in, and get a few winks of sleep,
brother,” he told Perk, who had yawned once or
twice as he sat before the fire. “I’ll wake you up
in about an hour or so when you can take your
turn playing sentinel, until the dawn shows up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just as you say, old hoss,” came the ready
reply; “fact is, I’m a bit drowsy, an’ could get
away with a few winks; but don’t forget to wake
me when the hour’s up, remember.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s all right, partner,” Jack told him,
laughingly; “we’re in this game thirty-thirty,
and you’ll have your turn, depend on it. Now
get busy, and don’t you dare snore above a whisper
either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I do jest gimme a poke, Jack—tryin’ to
break myself o’ that nasty habit but I got to
have help, you know—no feller ain’t wholly responsible
fur what he does when he’s asleep.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In due time Jack aroused the other, and himself
sought a brief period of forgetfulness in
sleep. So the balance of the night passed, and
morning came with a clear sky, and a promise of
decent weather for the continuance of their
flight.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch22' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXII <br /> <br />OVER ARIZONA DESERTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Perk must have dreamed about that hot coffee
treat he had been promising himself, for when
Jack opened his eyes he found his comrade already
watching the bubbling pot, from which
delightful odors were commencing to escape in
the way of steam.</p>

<p class='c013'>They enjoyed quite a decent little breakfast,
what with the ambrosia contained in their aluminum
cups together with some crackers and jam,
after the crisp bacon had been disposed of. Jack
offered some to their prisoner, but the man sadly
shook his head, as if to say he had no appetite
whatever.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was not a bad looking fellow, only with a
weak sort of chin, and evidently built along a
line that could be easily tempted to go wrong if
the inducement were only gilded enough. Jack
felt sorry for him, especially since he had learned
about his family; and was determined to do what
he could so as to get Simeon off, should his information
prove of any value to their cause.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once breakfast was disposed of they all went
over to where the ship lay. By this time Simeon
had found that they really planned to carry him
off with them, a startling fact that added to his
alarm, for apparently he had never been up in
a plane, and a species of stage-fright made him
shake as if he had the ague.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there was no other way to work things,
for should they set him free the chances were
the man, forgetting his promise, would try to
send out some kind of warning to Slippery Slim,
and in the end he and Perk were apt to pay dearly
for their slip-up, perhaps even with their own
lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>When playing such a desperate game with so
canny a lawbreaker it would be the height of
folly to let the dictates of tender hearts turn
them from the path of “safety first,” and Simeon
must continue to “take his medicine,” even
though the innocent ones at home suffered for
his misdeeds—he had never considered others
whom his evil actions had doubtless harmed,
when they found themselves arrested for passing
worthless bills, and how could he expect these
sworn officers of the law to go easy with him
when caught in the act?</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk now began to wonder just how they
would be able to “tote” a third party in the limited
accommodations afforded by the double
cockpit of their ship. It was bound to prove a
tight squeeze, and not so comfortable but then
why grumble on account of a trifle like that,
when Fortune was giving them such a glad hand
all the while?</p>

<p class='c013'>He began to shift things around some while
Jack was busy checking the motor, struts, undergear,
and propeller, with the design of condensing,
and making more room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Funny how you c’n jam things into such a
small compass when you really an’ truly try,”
he told Jack, when he had finished his task. “I
kinder guess I’ll be able to fix him okay, ’cause
he’s no great shakes at size, an’, seems like to
me, he’s shrinkin’ right afore my eyes, he’s that
shaky. Then it’s only for the day, I figger; how
’bout that, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve planned all that out, partner,” he was
told. “As soon as we get over to the California
border we’ll give him in charge of some sheriff
to keep in the hoosgow till we’ve made our killing,
and are ready to deliver the whole batch to
Uncle Sam’s nearest U. S. District Attorney,
at Los Angeles or San Diego. That clear to you,
Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say it was, boss, an’ here’s hopin’ we’ll
get there with both feet when the end shows up,
our prisoners hobbled, an’ with nice new steel
bracelets decoratin’ their wrists. Now to get
the gent aboard the boat, an’ stowed away.
Shucks! he acts like he might be scared out o’ a
year’s growth—some sillies get that way ’bout
goin’ up in a skyscraper the fust time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>His scorn for such a weakling showed in his
face as he helped Simeon to clamber into the
cockpit. The man was as white as a sheet, and
trembling as if expecting to meet with some dire
end in short order, once he left the firm ground
and took to the boundless air. His groans were
heartrending, and Jack felt sorry for the wretch
but for once Perk displayed no signs of sympathy,
it was all so silly in his opinion.</p>

<p class='c013'>He proceeded to take precautions by fastening
the greenhorn in by means of a stout strap which
would prevent his falling out should conditions
necessitate a sudden banking on the part of the
pilot, or a fierce gust of wind cause the ship to
give a unannounced plunge.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All ready, Jack,” announced Perk, after
completing these arrangements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll be with you inside of three minutes,” he
was told, and as the ground ahead had been examined,
and found to be fairly good for the
wheels to trundle over, there seemed to be nothing
more that could be done, only put things to
the test.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was “some rough,” as Perk told himself,
when violently shaken once or twice but they
managed to get up sufficient speed to admit of
Jack lifting her when the right time arrived.
Then they were off, rising like a bird, and almost
immediately opening up the village that nestled
there two miles off, at the foot of the low ridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack headed straight into the west, for that
was their route “as the crow flew.” He cared
not at all that they would pass directly over the
settlement, for few of the people were apt to be
abroad at such an early hour, nor would they
be any the wiser for seeing a plane pass overhead
at such a low altitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, looking down, found himself wondering
which of the modest cottages in line of his vision
chanced to be the home Simeon had spoken of
with such a catch in his voice. The man had
temporarily forgotten about his fears concerning
his own safety, while being carried so high above
the surface of the earth—he was stretching his
neck, and eagerly focussing his staring eyes on
one spot, which evidently held all that he held
dear. Perk ignored his recent sensation of scorn,
and actually felt sorry for the man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor guy,” he was saying under his breath,
though the other could not have heard him had
he shouted at the top of his lungs, on account of
the racket being kicked up by combined motor
and propeller, “he feels right bad ’cause he’s
goin’ off without a chanct to say goodbye. Well,
I on’y hope this will be a lesson to Simeon, an’
he’ll quit playin’ with a buzz-saw, which is the
long arm o’ our Uncle Samuel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon tried his best to keep tabs of the lonely
little hamlet until it was no longer possible to
distinguish objects, owing to the several miles
of distance the speeding plane had covered; then
he fell back in his seat, and let his head drop
on his chest, while his body shook with emotion.
In that dreadful moment he would undoubtedly
have only too gladly given all he had in the wide
world for a chance to undo the wrongs he had
committed in his haste to get rich.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! he orter thought o’ that before, while
the goin’ was good!” was Perk’s comment, who
had seen just such short-sighted men more than
once before in his eventful life, and had a philosophical
mind concerning all such late repentances.
“But I’m sure sorry for them that are
agoin’ to suffer the most—he deserves all he’ll
get, but they’re the innocent ducks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The plane soared along its set course, and as
they were not at more than something like five
thousand feet altitude, Perk could see very well,
when he adjusted the binoculars they carried of
necessity, so as to be able to spy out conditions
before trusting themselves to land, being naturally
a bit suspicious while thus drawing steadily
nearer to what might well be called enemy land.</p>

<p class='c013'>From time to time he found himself gazing
down with considerable curiosity upon scenes
which were mostly foreign to his eyes—he had
only too often scrutinized pictures where uncounted
troops belonging to the enemy were encamped,
or on the march, with monster guns
making the very air quiver with the tumult of
their discharges; where rival pilots came up in
answer to his insulting challenge, to engage him
in deadly combat—he had seen many an unlucky
or less skillful airman go down with his whirling,
blazing coffin, yielding up his life as a tribute
to what he called patriotism—all these and a
multitude of similar thrilling spectacles could
be unrolled in memory as he thus sailed the
azure sky, and saw Jack meet and conquer successive
air pockets lying in wait to give him battle;
and yet this was actually the first time Perk
had ever focussed his gaze upon a genuine cattle
ranch, and saw stock being driven to market,
or it might be mavericks branded; so that he
found himself entranced with the panorama
spread before him as they glided over the prairies
of New Mexico.</p>

<p class='c013'>There cropped up other and like interesting
sights when the wilder sector of country was
reached, with its deep gullies, its bare-topped
mountain peaks—perhaps stretches of desolate
desert where nothing could be seen save billowy
sandy wastes, except possibly patches of yucca,
sage, greasewood, and prickly pear cactus.</p>

<p class='c013'>When, his interest increasing, Perk begged
his comrade to drop down so as to give him a
nearer view of these strange sights, he was able
to increase his knowledge concerning the myriad
of strange sights to be picked up when touring
by air in new territories—now he could make
out the fantastic Joshua trees that seemed to be
engaged in a shimmering dance in the blazing
sunlight; moving shadows that sometimes crossed
the line of his vision he made out to be buzzards
on the wing, circling in search of their carrion
meal; while others on the ground he recognized
as coyotes skulking along, frightened by the sight
and noise coming from far over their heads, and
trying to reach their secret dens in some rocky
canyon or defile.</p>

<p class='c013'>Noon came in due time, with the ship keeping
up its steady grind, and having left hundreds of
miles in its wake.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk began to realize that he had eaten his
breakfast at an unearthly hour, and concluding
that a bite of something, together with a swig of
water from their jug, might go well, he mentioned
the interesting fact that the usual lunch
hour had come, at which Jack nodded his head,
as if to leave all that sort of thing to the discretion
of his trusted pard.</p>

<p class='c013'>So they had a pick-up snack, which was quite
acceptable to the two airmen, able to enjoy their
meals even while cutting capers up among the
clouds. It was another thing to the novice
Simeon, whose appetite had not come back,
though he did manage to swallow a few bites,
and have a drink of cold water to wash things
down. By slow degrees he was getting the upper
hand of his dreadful fears, for while familiarity
could not be said to bring contempt, nevertheless
he was becoming accustomed to the conditions,
and could even display a trace of curiosity
when looking down on some unusually interesting
spectacle to which Perk was pointing so
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>If things continued to exist as they had been
doing all morning it was likely—Jack at one time
told his co-pilot in answer to a question—that
they would be close to the California border by
sunset, or shortly afterwards; since even then
they were well along across Arizona, with fair
skies still beckoning them on their way.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch23' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIII <br /> <br />ON TO THE COLORADO</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Listen, Perk, I’ve got something you should
know—something that hinges on a change of
plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was saying this at a time when, relieved
from the controls he could enter into one of the
little confabs that their use of the ear-phones
allowed. All Perk had to do was to lean forward
and while still handling the stick drink
in whatever his co-pilot chose to say.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! spit it out then, partner,” was his familiar
way of inviting confidence and which
meant so much with those who knew Perk’s peculiar
sayings best.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be sure Simeon Hawkins was sitting close
beside Perk, and what Jack meant to confide in
his running mate could never be intended for
his ears but despite this elbow to elbow touch
there was not the slightest risk of his being able
to pick up a single word, owing to the clamor
kicked up by motor exhaust and propeller.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re going on a bit further than was arranged,”
said Jack, concisely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! meanin’ we don’t pull up when we
strike the border, eh, what, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just that, brother—the going is good, and
we might as well keep moving till we drop down
on the Metropolitan Airport grounds.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whoopee! you mean at Los Angeles, don’t
you, old hoss?” demanded Perk, apparently considerably
surprised by his pal’s bald statement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Righto, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How come, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get this fixed in your noodle,” said the resting
chief pilot—“circumstances often alter cases,
they tell us; well, when we figured on halting at
or near the border, close to the Gila River,
things hadn’t happened such as have hit us since
then.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Meanin’ the storm, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was one thing,” admitted the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Knockin’ us out o’ our reckonin’, like, an’
makin’ us take a forced landin’ on the open
prairie where we run across that flimsy ol’ shack—does
that cover what you mean, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“After a fashion it does,” the other told him,
adding: “like the play of Hamlet, with Hamlet
left out, it falls flat. You omitted the chief reason
for my making this change in plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess you must mean Simeon here, eh
boy?” asked Perk, as if suddenly waking up to
the fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing—what are we going to do with
<i>him</i>, tell me, Perk? It’d be impossible for us
to lug him everywhere we mean to go, flying
across into Mexico, and baiting the wolf in his
own lair, as you might say. He’d be a constant
hindrance to our being free to act besides, we’d
run a fat chance of having him give us away,
just when we thought it was all over but the
shouting.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, Jack—it means you don’t trust his
promises to lend us a helpin’ hand, and goin’
back on his pals—ain’t that the idea?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it,” replied Jack, never bothering
to drop his voice a particle, knowing as he did
that without the aid of those valuable ear-phones
Simeon, humped up against the side of Perk,
could not have caught what was said even
though it had been shouted at the top of his
voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what then, partner?” continued Perk,
apparently still groping in the dark.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing to hinder our tripping right along
till we fetch up at Angeles, when we can find a
way to hand him over to the Federal agents located
there. He’s connected with the big gang
against which Uncle Sam’s declared war to the
knife; and as a material witness, ready to turn
State’s evidence, they’ll be only too well pleased
to hold him <i>incommunicado</i>, so he can’t do a
thing to warn the bunch the big push is on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Okay, Jack. Sounds mighty good to me,
you bet. I’d never a cudgeled my brains enough
to hatch up an idea like that; takes you to think
o’ clever dodges, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then we’ll consider it settled, eh, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just what we will,” came the confident reply.
“’Bout when ought we raise the last beacon
on the road to Angeles, an’ lamp the field
lights at that same Metropolitan Airport?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! if everything goes well, you might call
it along toward midnight,” Jack assured him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got aplenty o’ gas to carry on that far, I’d
guess?” hazarded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s to be hoped so,” said Jack; “because
there’s some mighty tough stretches of country
between the Colorado and the big Pacific city.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! so I understand, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And it would be a bad job for us if we had
to hit the ground where you couldn’t scrape up
a decent landing place with a fine-tooth comb.
When I take the stick again, Perk, maybe you’d
better have a look in, so’s to get tabs on our fuel
tank, and tell me how it stands. From the dial
finger yonder I figure we’ll have a lot more than
enough to see us through.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s right, boss,” affirmed Perk, after casting
a hasty glance at the tell-tale figures so
plainly marked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That settles it then,” with which remark
Jack showed by his actions that further conversation
was needless.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Simeon sat there through it all, never
once dreaming how his fate was being so calmly
settled; doubtless he imagined the consultation
had been about something connected with the
running of the cloud-chaser, and covered facts
such as would have been all Greek to him, even
had he been able to listen in.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was not at all bothered by this change
of plans on the part of the head pilot—it mattered
little when they managed to drop down at
the airport—chances were the ground lights
were kept on full through the whole of each
night, since air mail planes would be apt to
come and go, some of them having been thrown
out of their regular schedules by dense mountain
fogs, or head winds that cut down the customary
speed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, also, was well acquainted with the
courtesy to be encountered at all such well conducted
flying fields, where every one would be
eager to do whatever was possible for the comfort
of those who chose to visit such ports, and
show little or no undo curiosity connected with
the reason for their coming.</p>

<p class='c013'>True, they might turn out to be a bit short
with the “eats;” but Perk, who knew the ways
of his pal so well, felt certain Jack would see to
it they had a chance to “fill up” as soon as they
could strike an open restaurant, of which there
should be no lack in such a wide-open city as
Los Angeles, with its sporty crowds at Hollywood.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was moving on apace, and
there cropped up fresh thrilling sights every little
while, for Perk to stare at through his useful
glasses. They were following the course of
the famous Gila River toward its confluence
with the still better known Colorado, which
hundreds of miles further north passed through
the Grand Canyon country, most majestic in a
panorama sense of any region on the face of the
globe.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along about nightfall they might expect to
pass over Yuma, located close to the junction of
the two rivers. Perk wondered once or twice
why his pal had not decided to land there, and
turn the prisoner over to some one in authority;
but he felt certain Jack had good reasons for
not attempting this.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe, now,” Perk told himself, with Jack
again running the ship, while he attended to
some of his own manifold duties; “he
guessed there might be a bad crowd at Yuma—fellers
apt to be in cahoots with the same
gang o’ daredevils Simeon here was connected
with; and who might even try to effect his escape,
so as to shut his trap—even go so far as to
knife the poor skunk to make sure he didn’t
peach. Oh! yeah, that’s the way Jack looked
at it, bet your boots it must be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Soon afterwards the sun gave notice that it
was about to withdraw behind the line of mountains
lying toward the west. Jack had his bearings,
and expected to be able to pick up the flash
beacons arranged for the convenience of the air
mail corps in their night flights to and from Los
Angeles. So thoroughly has this all been
mapped out, with the signals to be found about
every ten miles, that a pilot can see as many as
three ahead at one time, depending on the altitude
at which he may be flying.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such wise precautions had been taken that
would make night flying just as safe and easy as
during the daytime one thing only cropping up
from time to time to raise trouble, and cause delay
was the presence of the fogs that were apt
to rise from the deep canyons, to blot out those
friendly gleams of flashing light marking the
air mail course from start to finish.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch24' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIV <br /> <br />SIMEON GROWS DESPERATE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was commencing to grow dusk when they
sighted the lights of Yuma, that town on the railroad
leading to Los Angeles. Such a thing as a
plane flying overhead was so common these modern
days as to hardly excite any comment—they
came and went, with seldom anything out of the
usual taking place although not so very far
away, among the mountains, one of the most
dreadful of all air tragedies known to the annals
of flying had taken place, when the great
liner <i>City of San Francisco</i>, lost in a storm,
struck head-on against a rocky cliff, shattering
the ship and causing the death of every one of
those aboard, some seven souls in all.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now they had left Yuma far in their rear, and
Jack was watching to pick up the first flash beacon
on the way to the Coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>The weather continued to favor them, the
heavens being almost devoid of any semblance of
clouds, and the air quite cool at the height they
maintained while heading into the beckoning
west.</p>

<p class='c013'>Over deserts and mountainous stretches they
kept swinging along, to the constant accompaniment
of the customary chorus of a bustling plane
threading the mighty air lanes of the skies. The
silvery stars came out in battalions to sprinkle
the azure heavens like innumerable bright lanterns,
such as could be seen in Old Japan during
carnival times.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was the life, Perk told himself again and
again, sitting there after he had munched his
scanty portion of their meagre supper, Simeon
having again declined to share with them—what
air pilot who has tasted of the joys of such hours
could ever dream of forsaking his vocation, so
long as Fortune allowed him to retain his vision,
hearing, and the faculty for guiding an onrushing
ship through the realms of unlimited space—not
he for one, Perk assured himself, drawing in
huge draughts of the clear air, and watching the
wonderful beacons as they passed them by,
threading the pathway of the stars as it were,
straight toward their distant goal.</p>

<p class='c013'>The night wore on, with the voyagers making
splendid progress.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had made no miscalculation when saying
he believed they would fetch up at their destination
somewhere about the midnight hour; for
it still lacked more or less of that time when in
the near distance they glimpsed lights telling
that the city, and its nearby aviation field, must
be close at hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they found themselves circling over the
port, which, just as Jack had fancied would be
the case, was lighted most brilliantly. Even as
they sighted the field they noted a ship settling
down, evidently an air mail plane that had
been held up by some dense fog belt which they
had fortunately missed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Soft snap I’d call it, droppin’ down with all
them field lights to show the ground, so a feller
c’n see a rock the size o’ a baseball,” was what
the tickled Perk was telling himself while Jack
was proceeding to make the terminal drop, with
several ground attendants hurrying up so as to
lend any assistance needed.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had received his instructions from Jack,
and removed the handcuffs from the wrists of
the prisoner. There was no necessity for letting
everybody know the facts and the sight of a
man wearing steel bracelets, and gripped by an
attendant never fails to excite keen curiosity with
most people and especially would this be the
case if he had just come by the air route from
some unknown and therefore mysterious quarter.</p>

<p class='c013'>He would keep his arm through that of
Simeon, and inform him in a forcible whisper
that should he attempt any “funny business” it
would be at the risk of being shot down without
further warning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack would attend to everything necessary,
such as having their crate stowed away in some
convenient hangar, where it could be recovered
at any time, by paying such charges as were
customary.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be sure Perk was questioned by several of
the men while Jack saw that the ship was being
taken care of but when he chose, Perk could keep
a still tongue in his head and since he paid no
attention to what was said, and never opened his
mouth in the least, possibly they concluded he
must be both deaf and dumb.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk may have chuckled deep down in his
throat when he heard a few of the disgusted
remarks some of the men exchanged concerning
his lack of speech and hearing but
he kept his own counsel; and in the end Jack
came up saying he had secured a taxi to carry
them to a small hotel down in the heart of the
city, recommended by one of the hostlers who
seemed to know what he was talking about.</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon had looked a bit anxious, as though
wondering how their arrival at Los Angeles
would affect his wretched fortunes but he made
no attempt to appeal to the crowd for help.
Undoubtedly he was firmly convinced that the
grim Perk must be a man of his word, and that
any attempt on his part to break away would
prove a most serious matter indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah!” Perk was telling himself under his
breath when he took note of this humble disposition
on the part of Simeon, “Guess now he feels
it’s a heap better to be a live fool than a dead
hero; an’ by jinks I don’t blame the beggar for
thinkin’ thataways either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon all three safely lodged in the
taxi—which fortunately had remained up to this
late hour, the driver hoping to pick up a fare—and
heading for the nearby city.</p>

<p class='c013'>Later on they entered the small hotel, and
found it all the obliging ground attache at the
port had said. Jack registered the party, all of
them under fictitious names, since it paid to exercise
due caution when on the track of big game
just as it would for the big game hunter to make
no sound when advancing upon an enormous
tusker or “rogue” elephant whose spoor he had
been trailing through forest and jungle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Would it be possible for us to have some
supper sent up to our room?” Jack asked the
night clerk who shrugged his shoulders as if
dubious concerning his ability to accommodate
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kindly try to have it done, if double price
will have any effect,” continued Jack, using his
most gracious smile that usually accomplished
his purpose and at that the clerk responded by
saying he would do his best but it was of course
most unusual, and he hoped they would not make
any complaint if the variety was not all they
might wish.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quantity is the chief thing that interests
us,” said Jack; “you see, we have come
by air, and fell short of food while on our way,
so that my two pals here are very near being
starved; so whatever you send make it a fairly
bountiful spread, please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they were shown to their room, which
contained a double bed and a cot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I kinder guess now, partner,” said Perk, after
flashing a glance around the apartment, fronting
on a back lot, though up in the third story of the
building, “you an’ me better share the bed, while
Simeon gets his little nap on the sofy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That goes, Perk,” his comrade told him
“and after we’ve had supper we’ll hit the hay.
After such a broken night as we had back a ways
some sleep ought to be welcome, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! hope we don’t have to wait too tarnel
long for the grub,” Perk was saying, dismally
rubbing his stomach, as if to show how flat it
seemed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack engaged him in conversation of a general
character, just to keep his mind from dwelling
on the subject of eating for once Perk let himself
believe he was in danger of famishing and
he just could not subside but must commence
to marshal all the known dishes of which he was
especially fond, and keep on taunting and tantalizing
himself by stringing them off as might a
glib-tongued waiter in any restaurant.</p>

<p class='c013'>After quite a tiresome wait there was a knock
at the door, which Perk hastened to answer.
Two waiters strode in, bearing trays laden
with a pretty substantial assortment of food—quite
a satisfactory display, Jack thought, considering
the late hour, and that probably the regular
kitchen force must have long ago turned in
or else gone home.</p>

<p class='c013'>The table fairly groaned under the assortment—Perk
pertinently mentioned the fact,
adding that he guessed he’d do his share of
groaning <i>after</i> he had finished his supper which
Jack did not doubt in the least, having a knowledge
concerning the other’s vast appetite, and
unbridled disposition to make a pig of himself
at such times when food was plentiful.</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon Hawkins was coaxed to sit down with
them and as his state of mind seemed to have
improved quite a little, he also partook of food
of which he most certainly was much in need,
having fasted so long and abstemiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>When this ceremony had been carried through
to a finish, the supply of visible victuals had been
wonderfully reduced; and even Perk was heard
to declare he could not eat another bite, which
meant he was like a stuffed turkey, fit for the
Thanksgiving table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before turning in, Perk took occasion to “talk
like a Dutch uncle,” as he termed it, to Simeon,
assuring him he need not be in too upset a state
of mind concerning his future, since Jack had
said he was bound to do all he could to have him
let go, because of what he had confided to them,
and such assistance he would be able to lend the
Government in convicting the head men of the
lawless conspiracy along the counterfeiting line.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other nodded his head as though he
understood that, having embarked in the game
of throwing down Slippery Slim, he realized
there was nothing else for him to do but go
through to the windup.</p>

<p class='c013'>So confiding Perk, thinking things would run
smoothly, took off some of his outer garments,
and rolled into bed, as it afterwards turned out,
happily choosing that side of the same nearest
to the windows of their room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack soon followed, and the last thing he noticed
ere snapping off the light was the humbled
Simeon wrapped in a blanket, and lying there
flat on his back, as though meaning to get what
sleep he could during that fragment of the night
still remaining.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was, so far as appearances went, sound
asleep; but then sometimes things are not just
what they seem. To tell the truth, Perk had
made up his mind ere lying down that he would
“sleep with one eye open,” as he called it, meaning
it was his intention to keep on the alert, ready
to jump out of bed at the least sign of trouble.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps when he thus decided it was with a
hazy idea they might have some sort of unwelcome
visitor during the night; he could not just
decide how this could be but then those unprincipled
agents of the counterfeiter king—like
the fellow who had rifled the belongings of
Scotty, the air mail pilot in Atlanta—were liable
to turn up anywhere, everywhere, when least expected,
and try to manipulate their bold games.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hearing some sort of sound as of a person
moving, Perk suddenly sat straight up in bed,
to see their prisoner in the act of crawling over
the sill of the nearby window, evidently bent on
giving them the slip!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch25' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXV <br /> <br />THE STAGE SET FOR BATTLE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Hey! you, lay off that stuff!” was the way
Perk exploded, even as he made a wild dash
across the floor, and clutched the reckless Simeon
by the arm, dragging him back into the room
by sheer strength.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other struggled but feebly perhaps he
was really horrified at the desperate chances he
had been about to take.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, you must be goofy, Hawkins, to try that
sort o’ game!” Perk went on scornfully,
as the wretched man writhed on the floor where
he had flung him. “Don’t you know it’s two
stories down to the roof o’ that extension; an’
chances are you’d a got a broken neck, or leg,
in the drop. Better make up your mind to take
the medicine an’ stand it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack of course had been aroused at the first
movement of his chum, and sat up in bed watching
the actions of the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Trying to take leg bail, was he, Perk?” he
remarked. “You can hardly blame the poor
dick, come to think of it because he’s rubbing
up against a tough proposition. Better put the
bracelets on him again, and tie his ankles together
he might get loco, and try to jump out
of a window, just to end it all and that would
be too bad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon, utterly cowed and silent, made no resistance
when Perk followed out his pal’s advice.
There were several hours of the night still remaining,
and they might as well secure such
sleep as lay in their power, since no one could
predict what sort of strenuous activity awaited
them in the near future.</p>

<p class='c013'>Came morning, and the two air detectives
were stirring.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another right fine mornin’ for us,” Perk remarked,
blithely, as he looked out of the window,
and made a grimace at seeing what a nasty
drop had awaited the desperate prisoner had he
succeeded in carrying out his plan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! that’s the usual program, I understand,
out here on the Coast,” Jack told him. “Hardly
ever see any rain in this blessed country; that’s
why they have to depend on irrigation for their
crops.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Plenty to keep us hoppin’ today, I kinder
guess, partner, eh, what?” volunteered Perk, as
he started dressing, after removing the stout
cords that had been wrapped about the lower
limbs of the Federal prisoner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never said truer words, boy,” Jack
added “got to settle about this business of having
our friend here held until the gate’s been
crashed, and our scoop put through. Then I
mean to have a good talk with several people in
the Government offices, who can give us a few
points that so far we’ve been missing. You can’t
pick up too much information when aiming to
stack up against smart lads like this Slippery
Slim. He’s got so many eyes on the watch the
chap who expects to corral <i>him</i> must get up right
early in the morning, and pull the wires in a
dozen different directions. I’d a heap rather
overdo the matter of taking precautions than to
let just one ragged end get loose, for a game like
this is only as strong as its weakest link.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do we eat here, or look up a restaurant?”
asked Perk, quite naturally, since it was the
easiest thing in the world for his thoughts to
turn toward the subject of catering to the loud
demands of his stomach, when the usual time
for meals came around.</p>

<p class='c013'>“On the whole I reckon it’d be as well for us
to stick around, and have breakfast fetched up
here,” suggested jack. “I’ll step down presently,
and see if it can be managed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just as you say, partner,” Perk told him,
grinning, to add: “Make her two fried eggs and
a rasher o’ bacon for me; also a big cup o’ coffee
with a stack o’ wheats done brown. Say, you
might add some toast, and an orange, seein’ that
this is California, an’ a feller ought to patronize
the fruit industry when happenin’ to visit the
Coast country. Guess that ought to fill a vacuum
okay, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Leave it to me, Perk, and you’ll never starve
to death I’m a good provider, and Uncle Sam
foots the chuck wagon bill.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When later on two waiters appeared laden
down with a mass of dishes, Perk grinned some
more, and looked quite joyous; for the odor of
coffee and bacon always pleased his sense of smell
as nothing else could.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Simeon had apparently about decided to
make the best of a bad bargain, for he began
sniffing as though the idea of breakfast appealed
to him—he certainly needed something to brace
him up.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along about ten o’clock they prepared to set
out for the offices of the Federal forces in Los
Angeles. Simeon had finally given his word not
to make any further attempt at escape. Jack had
been talking seriously with the fellow ever since
breakfast, trying to squeeze further information
from him, and holding out hope that if he “came
clean” he might yet be allowed to go back to his
family after the Government had made use of
him to send the leaders in the wide flung conspiracy
to prison for long terms.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again a convenient taxi was called upon to
convey the trio to their intended destination.
Both Jack and Perk evinced considerable curiosity
concerning the unfamiliar sights on the
streets. They asked numerous questions of the
driver, who chanced to be a communicative sort
of fellow, and filled them up with information
about the sunny queen city of the Coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not long before Jack’s magical passport,
sanctioned by the Big Boss at Washington,
brought them in contact with several high officials
who apparently had been secretly apprized
of their presence in the West, and had
also been requested to afford the two daring sky
detectives all the assistance possible in carrying
out their plan of campaign.</p>

<p class='c013'>So it came about that Simeon was taken off
their hands, after the story of his capture had
been told. Jack secured a promise that the man
would be lightly dealt with because of the valuable
aid he had already afforded the sleuth-hounds
of the air branch of the Law.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both of them shook hands with the pitiful
looking chap as he was taken away by a marshal
who had been summoned and who would see
that he was kept aloof from all other prisoners
until his testimony was wanted in court.</p>

<p class='c013'>After that they fell into a general talk, Jack
telling the deeply interested officials about the
stirring adventures befalling himself and Perk
since they first struck Atlanta, where the drive
really had its beginning.</p>

<p class='c013'>In return he was given such information as
had been gathered in connection with more recent
happenings along the line of Slippery Slim’s
operations and the fact of the matter was there
always seemed to be fresh outbreaks of the bogus
money disease in this or that part of the whole
Southwest, as new agents started to work virgin
territory until by this time the greatest unrest
and uneasiness existed among all Government
ranks.</p>

<p class='c013'>The balance of that day the two pals put in
taking a look around the city, visiting Hollywood,
and seeing a number of movie stars whom
they recognized from familiarity with their faces
on the silver screen at various times.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack paid another visit to Federal Headquarters
on the succeeding day, to gather up all
loose ends, and decide on his plans while Perk
took himself off to look up some old friend, who,
he understood, was making good in one of the
new big pictures.</p>

<p class='c013'>They met again late in the afternoon, with
Perk displaying signs of nervous tension for
almost the first thing he said to his chum was in
the shape of a leading question, which Jack undoubtedly
anticipated, knowing Perk’s headlong
nature as he did, and the habit of the other for
seeking speedy action.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wal, what’s the good word, old hoss—when
do we skip out from here, if so be it’s all set?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No more hanging fire, brother,” Jack assured
him, smilingly “we’re loaded for bear this time,
sure pop. I’ve been out at the airport, and had
a full tank of gas put aboard the crate as well
as all that stuff you sent over so’s to keep us from,
starving to death.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bully boy!” crowed the delighted Perk; “jest
can’t come any too soon to please me. I’m only
cravin’ a chanct for a set-to with the head o’ this
flim-flam bunch, who’s laughed at the Government
boys just once too often. Is it tonight,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Midnight ought to see us several hundred
miles on our way, if all goes well,” Jack told
him, not displaying any outward signs of jubilation
himself, although he undoubtedly must be
thrilled by the thought of how they were now
about to put everything to the test, and match
their wits against that astute schemer, for whom
the Federal prison doors were yawning so widely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never gimme sweeter words, old pal!”
Perk was saying, backed up by one of his most
hideous grins.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch26' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVI <br /> <br />ON THE FACE OF THE MOON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Jack proved as good as his word, for they were
off shortly after nightfall, and headed almost
due east. No one at the aviation field had the
remotest idea as to who they were, what their
destination might be, and whence they came.
But then this particular port was becoming a
very important link in the trans-continental
chain, with lines of great passenger and freight
airships going and coming not to mention the
several speedy air mail boats that covered their
hundreds of miles day or night and as a rule on a
schedule that seemed as perfect as that of any
train time table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was unusually silent, at least for him.
Perhaps he was realizing at last the serious
nature of the job they had undertaken—that it
was rather a weighty proposition, such as was
bound to require all their united reserve force
to put across.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still, he had absolute confidence in Jack’s
ability to swing the undertaking, and also refused
to allow anything like doubt to assail him
with regard to their united courage.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was by this time well understood that the
climax, when it came, would occur on Mexican
soil for now that all accounts from every quarter
were in hand, they knew absolutely that the den
of the counterfeiting gang was in a secret cave
among the mountains of Sonora also that the
sagacious Slim had bought protection from certain
local Mexican officials, who were suspected
of secretly plotting a new revolution, and took
this means for obtaining the money needed to
purchase arms in the States.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was even said that Slim never flew back to
his headquarters without loading his swift plane
with a dead weight of guns and ammunition as
the price he had to pay for being allowed to operate
undisturbed on foreign soil.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A pretty kettle of fish, I’d call that sort o’
game,” Perk had indignantly asserted, when he
learned of this see-saw method of currying favor
with the plotting generals who hoped to once
again turn the country upside-down and kick
the present rulers out of office, as well as seize
the city banks with their rich booty.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so it was, but Jack realized how it accounted
for the long spell of immunity Slim had
enjoyed while he lined his pockets, and spread
that financial panic throughout the Southwestern
States. There never had been his equal as a skillful
worker and bold lawbreaker; one who knew
how to set neighbor against neighbor, and make
every one work so that he could rake off a heavy
dividend from each separate deal.</p>

<p class='c013'>So he had for a long time been coming and
going, crossing the border, as a rule by the air
route, carrying his cargoes of deceitful bank bills
to various distributing points—like the one Jack
and Perk had struck by sheer accident—gathering
the genuine stuff contributed by his numerous
dupes, and leaving bulky packages of the wonderfully
executed spurious notes in exchange.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a veritable Golconda for the industrious
worker, who, safe from interference, had kept
as busy as the proverbial bee, that stores honey
day after day.</p>

<p class='c013'>They followed the line of swirling beacons
the air mail boys were in the habit of trailing,
since by this means they could pass some of the
numerous danger spots on their route. In good
time Jack expected to turn his back on these
friendly flashing lights and head due south, to
cross the border, and fly over foreign territory.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had been placed in possession of certain
secret documents issued by the Mexican government,
which proved how they knew of the unholy
alliance made between Slim, the counterfeiter
king, and those traitorous generals who yearned
for fresh outbreaks so as to pamper their own
personal fortunes, just then at low ebb.</p>

<p class='c013'>There existed something of an arrangement,
whereby the Mexican government agreed to
stand back of any effort made by the Department
at Washington to capture Slim, smash his gang
that was widening its powers every day, and
clean out the mess of near-bandits with whom he
had allied himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>If it were necessary all arrangements had been
made whereby Colonel Jose Morales, with a
crack regiment of hard fighting regulars who
had seen much bloody service in bringing the
defiant Yaqui Indians to terms by invading their
mountain fastnesses, and meeting them hand-to-hand—was
stationed within a day’s ride of the
ravine where Slim had his plant and could be
summoned by means of certain smoke signals.
No sooner would these “talking smokes” be detected
than the order would be given “boots and
saddles,” with the mounted regiment in full
swing for the debatable ground where Slim had
his nefarious nest.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, too, had a secret arrangement been effected
with the old leader of the now defunct Texas
Rangers, most of whom were in the service of the
Government connected with the border patrol
and orders had been given the former gallant
hero that if a certain message were received, no
matter by what method, he was to gather a squad
of his old fighters, and cross the border, sure of
being warmly received by the loyal Mexican
troops who would welcome his assistance in wiping
out the sore spot that had been so long a blot
on their country’s honor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus it would seem that everything possible
had been done toward striking a telling blow.
It only remained for Jack Ralston to start the
ball rolling, when it must gain fresh impetus
with every revolution.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk acted as though decidedly pleased when
later on he discovered that they no longer followed
the flashing beacon trail—Jack had gone
as far as was judicious along that line and now
headed straight into the mysterious south, toward
the border of the neighboring republic where
disorder still held sway, and disgruntled chiefs
continued to plot against the rule of the recently
elected president.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every mile traversed now was bringing them
closer to their goal, and Perk found more or less
joy in picturing the thrilling climax, when they
would give Slippery Slim the surprise of his
life—if only no leak concerning their clever plan
had come about.</p>

<p class='c013'>The moon had risen, and was hanging there
in the east, a silvery shield with one edge clipped
off telling that the queen of the night was already
well past her “full” stage and running for
a fall.</p>

<p class='c013'>All at once Perk had an electric shock.</p>

<p class='c013'>He leaned convulsively forward and gripped
his mate by the shoulder, at the same time pointing
toward the southeast and shouting through
the head phones:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look, oh look—see what’s passing across the
moon, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then just as suddenly did he release his clutch,
to fall back in his seat, and exclaim most dramatically,
with a touch of disgust in his voice:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! It’s slipped past, dang the luck!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But I got it all right, Perk,” the pilot assured
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it <i>was</i> a ship, an’ my lamps didn’t fool
me, partner?” Perk cried in renewed excitement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As sure as you’re born, that’s what it was,
brother,” Jack added.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Headin’ south, same as we’re doin’ right now,
eh, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, buddy—just what the crate was
doing, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the answer—could it a been <i>him</i>, on
his way back home with a load o’ machine guns,
life they say he carries every time he crosses the
border, after takin’ out a freshly printed batch
o’ his flimsy stuff to soak on the honest folks back
home?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s something we can only make a stab
at,” replied Jack. “Chances lean that, way, I
must say; but just the same it might have been
some mail plane that’s got blown off its regular
course, and is beating it for the home port. Then
again I understand the border patrol are handling
a few ships in their line of intercepting flyers
making a business of smuggling Chinese aliens
across the line night-times.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d give a heap to know the answer to that
puzzle,” continued Perk, who disliked enigmas,
and all that sort of thing calculated to make a
fellow lie awake nights, bothering his poor
brains. He never had been fitted by Nature for
the job of being a real detective.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll never know,” his pal told him, “unless
it happens we run afoul of the other crate when
our courses draw closer together and if it’s Slim
whose fingers grip that stick we’d rather be excused
for having that happen—our job is to fetch
him back <i>alive</i>, and not make him lose his life
in a crash.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me, I ain’t peticular just what <i>does</i> happen
to the slick guy,” Perk wound up the little talkfest
by saying. “Only, when it comes to a real
showdown either Slim or us got to go to the
wall—dead or alive, the thing’s goin’ to be settled
for keeps!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch27' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVII <br /> <br />THE SIERRA MADRE CHAIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Another thing Perk noticed—this was the fact
that Jack seemed to have changed his mind with
regard to making haste for the ship was racing
along at top-notch speed, as though engaged
in a race with some unseen rival.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hey! what’s the big idea, Jack?” he called
out, when this thing had been going on for some
time, and his burning curiosity could no longer
be held in leash. “Why doin’ the sprintin’ act,
I’m awonderin’?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Less chance for us to run foul of that other
boat if we forge well ahead, don’t you see, partner?”
exclaimed the pilot, sententiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! that’s a fact,” returned the enlightened
Perk. “An’ then mebbe it’d be jest as well for us
to get there ahead o’ the boss in the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m aiming to do that,” he was told.
“It happens that we can’t keep on in the boat till
we strike close to his hideout—the racket would
stir the whole bunch up like a hornet’s nest you’ve
kicked when going through the brush, with the
mad critters swarming out to tackle you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you now, Big Boss—never did think
o’ that before. Then I kinder guess we’ll
have to hike some little way,” and there was a
vein of chagrin in the speaker’s voice as he mentioned
this fact, since walking and Perk never
did seem to agree very well—like most flyers he
had been spoiled for all manner of pedestrianism
by his ability to cover such vast distances
without moving his pedal extremities an iota.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s our sure enough program,” Jack told
him, doubtless thinking that the delayed knowledge
might allow his pal to make up his mind
about swallowing the bitter medicine without a
single grimace.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not long after this little break when
Jack again spoke:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve a good idea we’re across the line now,
partner,” was the information he passed along.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sounds good to me, okay,” commented Perk,
with a tinge of solid satisfaction visible in his
voice as though having a possible rough-house
job to handle, the sooner he got busy the sooner
it was likely to be over.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And making more than an even hundred
miles to the hour in the bargain, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some punkins about comin’ in swell on the
last lap, this crate sure is, I’d say, partner.
Licketty split she humps along like a reg’lar
witch. I guess now she’d make rings around
that ol’ boat Slim’s got hold o’ though it
answers his purpose seems like. But see here,
Jack, you never did tell me jest how you got word
to that same Colonel Morales down here in
Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was given my instructions, and sent a telegram
to him at Hermosilla, in care of Padre
Lopez, giving him the order he was expecting—during
the last hour we were in Los Angeles.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! then the sojers must be in the saddle
right now!” burst out Perk, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If the arrangement went through without a
miss that’s like enough a fact,” admitted Jack;
“the way my plan’s arranged everything must go
off with the regularity of machine work, each
separate part dovetailing, so as to work in full
sympathy. If anything lags, and goes amiss, it’s
apt to throw the whole scheme out of gear, you
understand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! I grab what you mean, partner,” said
the astounded Perk; “but I got to hand it to you
when it comes to hatchin’ up big things—it’s jest
wonderful how you manage. An’ I sure do hope
everything’ll slide along like greased lightnin’,
once it gets started.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had planned to drop down in some isolated
spot where with the coming of dawn, with
the aid of the strong glasses they could pick up
the rocky Sierra Madre range with its canyons
and valleys, where, unless all his leads have been
false clues, those whom they sought would have
their secret den and stronghold.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk got to thinking these matters over, and of
course he was bound to run across some things
that still seemed a bit hazy in his mind. Accordingly
he sought for information at headquarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, now, d’ye know I’m jest beginnin’ to get
on to why you had the wings an’ fuselage o’ this
here ship painted the color o’ sand—took a pattern
from the way they striped the steamers on
the Atlantic durin’ the big war, an’ colored batteries
on the battle front, so flyers couldn’t pick
’em out to drop their bombs down on—camouflage,
ain’t that the right word, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Slow to get on to my little schemes, partner;
but in the end you make a smart stab—yes, that
was what I had in mind, for I knew we’d have
to park the old bus somewhere in the open; and
I didn’t want any hostile eye to glimpse her from
a soaring plane, or a mountain crag—for you see
I reckoned Slim was too smart a lad not to have
binoculars handy so as to watch for trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>More than ever was Perk impressed with an
overwhelming admiration for the ability of his
pal to lay plans capable of covering every possible
necessity that could arise in carrying out
the job they had tackled.</p>

<p class='c013'>He asked no more questions, confident that
everything was bound to move along smoothly,
when the casting of the play was in such capable
hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Anyway,” he told himself as he thus pondered,
“we ain’t seen anything more o’ that moon
ship, which makes it certain we’ve knocked her
outen the runnin’. Wonder now if that was really
an’ truly ol’ Slim, totin’ a swell bunch o’ machine
guns, so’s to bolster up the new revolution
they say is bein’ fostered an’ nursed in this corner
o’ poor ol’ Mexico. Queer what international
jingles a feller c’n get mixed up in, when he runs
in harness with Uncle Sam’s revenue boys; but
it’s all pie to me, just the same, ’cause they allers
did say my middle name was Scrap.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was now starting to make use of the binoculars,
which were fitted with lens capable of
making them useful during the night-time, at
least when there was a certain amount of moonlight.
In a general way Perk could decide where
to turn his attention, for it went without saying
that the mountain chain lay toward the southeast
for had he not studied the lay of the land
upon the small but accurate map with which
Jack had armed himself before leaving Washington
to take up this hazardous adventure?</p>

<p class='c013'>When he felt assured that he could make out
the distant ridges he announced his pleasing discovery
to his mate and then at the other’s request
took over the controls so that Jack in turn might
use the glasses and thus make assurance doubly
safe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bank, and head more into the east,” Perk
heard the other saying, after a steady look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it’s the Sierra Madre okay, partner, I
opine?” suggested the one at the stick, as he
obeyed orders.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question about it,” Jack assured him “but
I knew it was time for us to sight the ridge. I’ve
pored over the map of this section, and charted
it all out in blocks, so I can tell just what the lay
of the land is, and how long it’s apt to take the
colonel to get here with his galloping company.
We’re going to drop down presently, and find
shelter where we can lie low until the hour comes
for making our ten strike.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How long might that be, boss?” asked Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It all depends on certain happenings. We
can creep up close to the place, and watch how
things move figuring out how to act when you
get your first glimpse of a dust cloud away off
toward where Hermosilla lies. I give the cavalry
two days to reach here, if everything moves along
smoothly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Two long days—an’ say, we gotter eat all that
time, don’t we, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We surely can’t live on air, Perk; but I’ve
provided for that—even should we run out of
grub you laid in I’ve a little deposit of dried
meat, real pemmican in fact, that will keep us
from famishing. Water we can secure somewhere
among the mountain trails, since never a
drop would we be apt to find on the open desert.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! I’m leavin’ it all to you, Big Boss,”
Perk told him, again lost in wonder and near
awe as he realized how Jack seemed to have
thought of everything—what a mind the boy had
for grasping details, and weaving them into the
net with which they expected to enmesh the slippery
one.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now Jack slowed down their speed more or
less, although of course it was not possible to
soften the clamor accompanying their flight
through space. But Perk noticed that, so far as
he could tell, the night wind was coming from
ahead, and this assured him it would not be apt
to carry those telltale sounds toward the range
lying in the east, and so warn the enemy of their
coming.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch28' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVIII <br /> <br />CLOSE TO THE TIGER’S LAIR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“We’re about due for a landing, Perk,” finally
announced the pilot, after he had used the glasses
for a spell, and again took over the stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! some hike that’s agoin’ to be, I’d say,
old hoss,” grunted Perk; “but I guess it can’t
be helped—got to take the bitter with the sweet
lots o’ times—the way o’ the world, seems like.
Go to it then, boss; if anybody c’n make a safe
landin’ by moonlight it’s jest you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>His confidence was not misplaced, as Jack
proved when he brought the ship down in as
perfect a three-point drop as the best of aces
could have carried out.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’ll have to lie here till we need her again,”
he observed, on climbing out of his confined
quarters, and stretching his cramped legs after
the manner of air mail pilots in from a long and
irksome run.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk stared around him—they were on the
sandy desert without a doubt, and off toward the
east could be seen the dim crests of the high and
ragged peaks comprising the main ridges of the
Sierra Madres—old-time home of the fierce
Yaqui Indians, whom the soldiers of Mexico had
for so many years labored so hard and in vain
to conquer; nor was it until the day the airplane
came along that they were able to accomplish
this much to be desired end.</p>

<p class='c013'>But now other equally annoying thorns in the
flesh had made a hideout of those same
inaccessible mountains—defeated aspirants for
the presidency of the Republic, always generals,
took to gathering groups of malcontents and mercenary
adventurers in these mountain depths,
defying the troops sent to rout them out, and
proving the latest source of trouble in the political
problems of the authorities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack soon completed his preparations for
abandoning their ship. He looked it all over, to
satisfy himself its camouflage would prevent it
from being sighted by any air pilot chancing to
pass overhead at a reasonable altitude then he
gathered a few articles, the possession of which
might turn out to be of value when it came to
closing the mouth of the bag and finally announced
himself as ready to make a move.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got all you wanted, Perk?” he inquired, incidentally,
for he had reason to feel certain such
was the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! from the binoculars an’ my rifle, down
to what’s left o’ the eats,” the other assured him.
“Guess we’ll get along somehow or other.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! don’t bother your head about the grub
part, comrade; I’m carrying a small packet with
me that holds enough to keep two men alive for
a whole week—all we’ll have to do is to run
across some sort of spring, where we can get all
the drinking water we’ll need, while we wait for
the wagon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! in this case you’re meanin’ a <i>hearse</i>,
’cause mebbe we’ll have to shoot him up afore he
calls quits,” and Perk grinned horribly at his
own wit.</p>

<p class='c013'>So they left the ship stranded there, sprawled
out like a gigantic dragon-fly or a monstrous
toad. If Fortune proved kind they might yet
live to make good use of it again when the time
came to fly back to God’s country on the other
side of the border where defeated candidates
are in the habit of accepting the dictum of the
voters, and retiring from the field of battle await
the next call to arms, with ballots instead of
bullets as their method of settling elections.</p>

<p class='c013'>Side by side they set forth, like a pair of adventurers
starting out in search of Fortune’s
smiles, and careless alike as to whether they met
with success or not, so long as the excitement
they craved came their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk managed to conceal the chagrin with
which he buckled down to his unwelcome task,
walking always gave him a pain, mental rather
than physical but on the whole he was a good
scout, and could follow the beckoning finger of
duty, even though he loathed the conditions attached
to the performance of his role.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sand was far from compact, and allowed
them to sink in somewhat, so this made the going
more difficult in contrast to that on the seashore
which being beaten down by incoming waves is
often as hard as concrete and a pleasure to walk
over; whereas this of the desert was dry and
sifted at the least puff of wind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk having had some previous experience
with deserts, felt no love for the uninviting waste
places of the earth only such useless vegetation
as sage, greasewood, cactus and yucca would
grow between the sand dunes amidst the blistering
fangs of the infernal heat and always vowed
he disliked such arid regions with a violence too
deep for mere words.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet he kept his own counsel and plodded away
alongside his pal as if he had no personal feelings
in the matter whatsoever. Far off in front
of them they could see the line of peaks studded
against the sky once or twice Perk felt certain
he had caught a fluttering light aloft such as
might spring from a passing plane but in every
instance he finally decided it must be some shooting
star, ducking behind the mountain range,
leaving a trailing wake behind that but reflected
its passing glory.</p>

<p class='c013'>One hour, two, and then a third dragged along
before Jack thought fit to call a halt. Never did
poor weary footsore Perk, almost used up, listen
to more welcome and delightful words than
when Jack as he drew to a halt went on to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Time to rest, partner, you know—I’d like to
find a bunch of shady trees that would afford us
a decent shelter from the blazing sun, should we
be so unfortunate as to get adrift after leaving
all landmarks behind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! bless you for sayin’ that, buddy,” Perk
was saying hoarsely, for his throat seemed as dry
as tinder, the fine sand even affecting his vocal
cords so that he would not have recognized his
own voice. “By your leave I guess I’ll lie down
and get the kinks outen my legs. Wow! that
must abeen fi’ miles if she was one—my shoes
are full o’ sand, an’ altogether I don’t feel half
the man I was on startin’ out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There are some trees over yonder, you may
notice, Perk; so after we’ve caught our second
wind we’ll take chances, and cut across to where
they lie, perhaps when morning comes tripping
along, we may climb up the face of the mountain
and get a look-in at the printing establishment
that’s set itself up in opposition to the U. S.
Treasury Department, and the Federal Bank.
Come on then, a little further where we can drop
down, and rest our weary feet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards the pair had crept in
among the sheltering trees, where Jack called a
rest, although under the impression that they
should get along further before break of day.</p>

<p class='c013'>He talked matters over with his partner, speaking
almost in whispers, since in this enemy country
no one could take anything for granted and
for all they knew hostile ears might chance to
be close by, ready to listen in.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Perk himself who proposed to move
along while the going was good.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like we might be a heap better off, old
hoss, if on’y we located up thar on the side o’ the
mountain, where we could see without our bein’
watched. I’m okay now, an’ ready for b’ar.”</p>

<p class='c013'>That was the spirit Jack liked in his mate—a
readiness to take hold and reach a decision. They
moved along toward the base of the forbidding
height, keeping a watchful eye on the eastern
sky lest dawn come and surprise them in the
open, where it would not be easy to find a hiding
place during the entire day.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fortune favored them, for they managed to
get under cover before the first gray streaks appeared
in the east. It was bound to be a strenuous
task climbing that formidable mountain side
but Jack had prepared for even this part of the
adventure.</p>

<p class='c013'>From various sources he had learned how there
were three separate means for subduing that
grim pyramid of rocks and trees and tangled
growth—in order to lessen the chances of discovery,
with unpleasant consequences, Jack had
decided to try and negotiate the most difficult
of these mountain trails in the belief that it
would offer a safer passage since evidently none
of the seething revolutionists, or their allies, the
bad men from across the border, would be likely
to follow that canyon trail when others less difficult
could be utilized.</p>

<p class='c013'>Down there hidden by the bushes and spurs
of outlying rock they employed their time in
munching what must serve as their breakfast.
Then quenching their thirst at a convenient
pool they proceeded to climb the face of
the steep elevation, making for the quaint hollow
in the crater of a long dead volcano and which
had once been a Yaqui fort.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch29' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIX <br /> <br />NEARING THE GOAL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>They had now reached that most thrilling
point in their bold venture, where they would
have to “watch their steps” most carefully, lest
an incautious act precipitate a calamity that must
end all their hopes as well as snuff out their
lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>This breeding place for inflammatory embers
of Mexican revolutionary disappointed political
generals, and their immediate retainers, was
about as safe for the two sky detectives as a cage
of Bengal tigers would have been once let their
presence be suspected, and the entire neighborhood
would be scratched over as with a fine-tooth
comb in the endeavor to discover their
hiding place and should they be rounded up it
needed no magician to prophesy what their fate
must be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack led the way, with Perk following at his
heels, every sense on the alert. The native cougar
of that historical group of mountains could
hardly have crept along with greater care than
did the two human sleuth hounds of the law.
Every advance was attempted only after a careful
survey of the entire neighborhood—at the
sound of some faint bird-call Jack would sink
down and flatten himself upon the ground, his
example being imitated by his shadow.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this caused their progress to be exceedingly
slow but time did not enter into their calculations
so much as security—many hours must
pass ere Jack could figure on the arrival of those
upon whom everything depended and they
might as well make use of the entire morning in
climbing higher and higher toward their ultimate
goal.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once when they chanced to be resting their
tired limbs, snug in a sheltered nook behind a
mass of brushwood, Jack turned and looked back.
The site was especially fine for looking out on
the level stretch toward the spot where they had
landed during the preceding night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, watching the actions of his comrade,
could easily give a close guess as to what Jack
had in mind. This opinion was made more convincing
when he saw the other get out the useful
binoculars, and apply them to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Keenly he kept tabs on the others and was
finally thrilled to note the pleased nod Jack gave
as if wholly satisfied.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk touched him on the arm, and as Jack
turned made motions with his head, while his
eyebrows went up, his expression without a single
word being spoken signifying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How come?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take a look for yourself, and tell me if you
can get the first glimpse of our old crate” suggested
Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ doin,” whispered Perk, after a most
diligent search; “an’ if we can’t get a whiff o’
the boat, with these glasses, I kinder guess
nobody ain’t agoin’ to locate it with their naked
eyes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which same lets us out from any danger in
that quarter,” came softly from Jack, whose face
for the moment lost some of the strained look it
had borne during the last few hours.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never saw a better sample o’ camouflage
when I was across the big pond alistenin’ to the
smash o’ the rip-roarin’ German guns,” asserted
Perk; and then “dried up” when he saw the
other press a finger on his lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>Higher they climbed, like monkeys, taking all
manner of desperate chances when necessity
arose but so cautious was Jack in leading the
way that nothing amiss came about, every obstacle
being successfully surmounted until
shortly before the noon hour they found themselves
in a position to spy upon the camp of their
intended prey.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was intensely interested in what he now
visioned. The old crater, resembling an immense
football bowl, as adopted by some Eastern
colleges, looked as though it might have proven
well nigh impregnable as a fortress where the
fighting Yaquis were able to hold an army at
bay—which feat history records as an actual fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>Scattered about the depression were scores of
rude dwellings, some built of rocks, while others
more modern had walls composed of sun-baked
bricks, known throughout all Mexico as <i>adobes</i>.
Men and women, also children, could be seen
moving about, preparing the noonday meal or
partaking of their customary frijoles, hot tamales,
or it might be maize cakes cooked in the
hot ashes of fires, and with black coffee as a
beverage.</p>

<p class='c013'>The picture appealed to Perk, who delighted
in novel scenes nor did it seem to lose any of
its thrill from the fact that, as he very well knew,
the men he was staring at so eagerly were most
likely as tough a brand of desperadoes and villains
as could be grouped together anywhere on
earth—ready to fight, hold up trains, or commit
all manner of pillage at the drop of a hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>He marveled at the sagacity shown by Slippery
Slim in deciding to join forces with these
firebrands of the back country, with the idea of
thus securing the greatest safety for his own
lawless operations.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this while Jack had been keeping close
watch, in hopes of being able to pick out the
figure of the man he had been deputized to bring
back to the States so he might be prosecuted for
his crimes, and sent to Atlanta. There he would
possibly end his days in seclusion, with a large
portion of the Southwest breathing more freely
since they need no longer fear the avalanche of
counterfeit currency that had been demoralizing
business for such a long spell.</p>

<p class='c013'>After all it was Perk who made the discovery,
he chancing to be carefully handling the binoculars
at the time. He handed the glasses over to
his mate, and told Jack just where to look, using
as few words as possible, and keeping his voice
very low.</p>

<p class='c013'>Long and earnestly did Jack follow the movements
of the remarkable character who had been
described in his hearing so many times. What
satisfaction it afforded him to know he was actually
in sight of the big game and if only his
plans carried through his hour of triumph was
steadily drawing closer and closer. In imagination,
as he continued to watch the moving figure,
he could vision the pleasure it would afford him
when he could turn in his report to his Chief,
and mark it as completed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon drifted along, and night approached.
Nothing could be done to hasten the
crisis; they must wait patiently, and continue to
shape their plans until the expected smoke signal
told them Morales and his rough riders had
reached the foot of the Sierra Madres ten miles
further south and when assured by means of a
counter signal that everything was working well,
start to cover the last lap of their long ride, leave
their mounts at a safe distance, and complete the
journey on foot.</p>

<p class='c013'>When darkness fell the picture was even more
fascinating to Perk than before, with a number
of fires lighting up the huge bowl, the sound of
women chattering in Spanish, and children playing
just as all youngsters might do while from
time to time he could catch strains of music, telling
that some amorous swain might be practicing
on his guitar, as all who have a drop of Spanish
blood in their veins invariably love to do when
at leisure.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk doubtless made many a grimace while
partaking of the light refreshment afforded by
the tough pemmican Jack had produced, as their
sole means for staying their empty stomachs for
when the evening breeze wafted some of the
odors from the cooking fires down below it almost
set him wild with a desire to partake of hot
food. But he knew what he was up against, and
sternly repressed the inclination to groan his
protest.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was one of the longest nights Perk ever
knew. The mountain air, too, was cold, especially
along toward the last few hours and since
they were debarred from the joy of indulging
in a campfire, Perk could only lie there and
shiver. He never was so glad to see the pink
sky in the east as on that occasion.</p>

<p class='c013'>The day was but a repetition of their former
afternoon with their sole recreation being the
chance it gave them to watch Slippery Slim’s
movements whenever he appeared coming out of
what seemed to be a cavern of some sort from
which at several times when the racket from many
tongues died down Perk could catch a strange
rumbling sound, accompanied by what seemed
to be a blow, and which he could easily believe
must be the working of the printing press that
had been carried all the way from the States in
order to be able to produce those wonderfully
clever notes that had deceived many shrewd
bank tellers by their deceptive qualities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then at last Jack discovered, just as night had
begun to fall, three columns of smoke rising toward
the heavens from far down the wild Sierra,
telling how that Morales and his troop had arrived,
and that the curtain was about to rise on
the last scene of the international drama.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch30' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXX <br /> <br />JACK GETS HIS MAN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Immediately on discovering the welcome signal,
Jack dispatched Perk to put a match to the
heap of brush they had arranged well out of sight
from the depression where the skeleton revolutionary
army was slowly assembling its pitiful
force of the dissatisfied generals who had been
counted out in the last national election.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk understood what was expected of him,
and managed to send up a single smoke signal,
allowing it to have but a brief life and then hastening
to smother the fire. As Morales was expected
to be on the watch for just such a sign,
he would lose little time in starting to carry out
his part in the attack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In three hours they will be climbing the
mountain by way of the old Yaqui trail we followed,”
Jack was telling his chum, when the
other returned to his side, flushed with the success
of his labors. “It is time for us to make a
forward move, so that we may be ready to strike
as soon as the camp quiets down and corral our
man, leaving it to Morales to carry the fort itself
by storm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This they set about doing without any further
delay. Dodging from rock to rock, taking advantage
of every outlying spur, as well as patches
of hardy bushes, and other objects that were
likely to conceal their movements from any
watchful eyes but always creeping downward,
they crawled along like two great lizards such,
as Perk could remember seeing when in the
Philippines.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the time they were ready to slip into the
underground pressroom of the lawless printing
company’s plant, Jack figured the three hours
had just about expired, and that it was now up to
them to make the first hostile move that would
precipitate the assault.</p>

<p class='c013'>In thus deciding to make a start he was influenced
by seeing an agreed upon signal from
the same hiding place he and Perk had held for
so many hours, and which told him the troopers
had finally succeeded in climbing to the position
assigned to them when plans for action were
formed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Flattening themselves out against the dark
wall of a small cliff Jack and Perk glided along
until they arrived at that aperture in the solid
rock they knew to be the entrance to the wonderful
underground retreat that had been described
by Simeon at the time when in his desperation
he gave his confederates away and from which
they had watched Slippery Slim come and go
during those long hours of their espionage.</p>

<p class='c013'>Slipping inside, they found themselves in a
corridor that led into the body of the mountain
with a gleam of light beckoning them to advance.
In this fashion they kept moving, gliding from
one point to another, until eventually they had a
clear view of the little machine that was working
so industriously in turning out the bogus
money, hour after hour, as though the demand
were without limit.</p>

<p class='c013'>How Perk did stare, and hold his breath when
realizing that they were upon the verge of accomplishing
their great undertaking. Slippery
Slim was doing no actual manual labor himself,
but he kept close watch over the two men who
ran the press, closely scrutinizing the printed
bills as if to detect the slightest inaccuracy, and
correct it without delay.</p>

<p class='c013'>No wonder, Jack told himself, the product of
his skill had startled the financial world by its
genuine appearance, when such a master in his
particular line took such personal pains to see
that the work was carried out in its most minute
details.</p>

<p class='c013'>In whispers Jack informed his backer what his
duty would be when the roar of guns and hoarse
shouts from without announced that the picked
troopers had actually launched their long deferred
assault. Jack had taken it upon himself
to close in on the chief worker in that little
coterie, and have the glory of capturing Slippery
Slim unaided but meanwhile Perk might find
plenty of action in holding up those two others
who were second in importance only to the leading
figure.</p>

<p class='c013'>The tension had become almost unendurable
when suddenly there broke out a frightful uproar—women
were shrieking, children’s high
pitched voices told of intense alarm; men gave
tongue, and above it all guns began to sound with
deadly import, until the basin rocked with the
dreadful clamor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack waited no longer, but giving Perk a kick
on the shins to tell him to get busy he rushed
headlong toward Slippery Slim, holding his automatic
ready for instant service, knowing as he
did that such a desperate bad man as Slim
was reckoned from all accounts, would not be
apt to surrender so long as there remained the
slightest chance for a getaway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nor was he mistaken in judging the character
of the man who had so long defied the shrewdest
detectives of the United States Secret Service
for when Slim found his way to the open air
barred by such a determined looking figure, he
snatched out his handy gat and made as if to open
fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>For once he was just a trifle too slow with his
service gun, for Jack, clever lad that he was
along the line of firing off-hand, managed to send
a bullet through Slim’s right shoulder that crippled
him, so that his own weapon went rattling
to the stone under his feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put ’em up!” Jack was saying, covering his
man as he spoke and having no desire to commit
suicide, Slippery Slim obeyed the call; and
instantly afterwards suffering the painful ignominy
of having his wrists encircled by a pair
of nice new steel bracelets.</p>

<p class='c013'>So far so good, with Jack, his own share of the
capture an accomplished fact, able to turn in
order to lend Perk a helping hand. It was not
needed, for Perk had descended on those two
muscular chaps like a thunderbolt, knocking one
down with a terrific jolt under the chin and
causing the other to look along the short barrel
of his blued automatic, he having discarded the
repeating rifle for the time being in favor of
the easier handled pocket gun.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the trio of discomfited rogues were all
handcuffed, Jack and his reliable partner turned
and faced the other way, so as to be ready for a
rush, should some of those valorous generals
decide to take advantage of the defensive security
of the rock cave, and bolt into its gaping mouth.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being actually attempted they met with
a demoralizing surprise when they found themselves
the objects of a hot fire, that brought about
a complete right-about face movement and
presently forced their ignominious surrender to
the gallant Colonel Morales and his fierce fighters,
who had once before gone through an interesting
campaign in that same old extinct volcano
vent, with warlike redskins as their opponents.</p>

<p class='c013'>The end was not long in coming, with many
of the would-be revolutionists holding up their
hands in complete surrender others escaping
by losing themselves along the scraggly sides of
the mountains and not a few either slain outright,
or seriously wounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and his chum had a chance to meet the
doughty Colonel Morales, pride of the Mexican
army, and be congratulated on their clever work
of rounding up such a jack-o’-lantern, fly-by-night
as Slim Garrabrant. Of course the two
comrades were eager to start back to the other
side of the border, since complications might
come up over their legal warrant to arrest a criminal
so badly wanted by the Washington authorities,
but who had made his headquarters south
of the international line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly they handed over Slim’s two lieutenants,
who would have to answer to a charge
of being hand-in-glove with those plotting generals,
and doubtless find themselves incarcerated
in a Mexican dungeon for some years, a fate that
made Perk shudder to contemplate.</p>

<p class='c013'>While he stood guard over their prisoner, Jack
sent Perk off at dawn, mounted on one of the
cavalry horses, and accompanied by a soldier
who would fetch back both animals, Perk’s duty
being to get the stranded ship off the ground,
and drop down at a more convenient spot closer
to the former mountain stronghold of the tiger-like
Yaquis.</p>

<p class='c013'>By nightfall they were hundreds of miles on
their way over Arizona and New Mexico, Jack
having decided to carry his prisoner, whose
wound did not prove to be very serious, though
painful enough—all the way to Washington, and
present him to his superior, with his customary
air of not realizing that he had done anything
extraordinary.</p>

<p class='c013'>That this thrilling feat was only a common
occurrence in the lives of such intrepid manhunters
as serve the Government through the
agency of the Secret Service and that from time
to time Jack and Perk might with reason be
expected to duplicate such adventurous feats can
be set down as certain; indeed, the title of the
next number in the Sky Detective Series, “<i>Eagles
of the Sky; or With Jack Ralston Along the Air
Lanes</i>,” a tale of the smugglers of the Florida
Coast, will grip the reader from start to finish,
and prove to be one of the most thrilling stories
ever written for lovers of action and valor.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

  <h2 id='ch01' class='c011'>CHAPTER I <br /> <br />READY FOR THE TAKE-OFF</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>It was a day in the late Fall when Jack
Ralston, accompanied by his best pal, Gabe
Perkiser, known simply as “Perk” by all his
friends, found themselves climbing out of a
hired taxi that had halted on the border of
Candler Flying Field just a short distance out
of Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! reg’lar mob out here today, seems
like,” observed Perk, as he took note of the
triple line of cars parked around the field, with
its numerous up-to-date hangars, and with ships
coming and going every few minutes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, you see Perk, it happens to be a big day
at stunt flying, with fat prizes for the winners.
All the better for us, I’d say, since our take-off
will hardly make a ripple in the pond, with all
this confusion going on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing, my boy,” continued Perk, with
one of his humorous grins that betokened a good-natured
chap; “and privacy’s just what we crave.
I guess now that might be the mail comin’ from
down East an’ New York?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A rotten guess then, Perk,” chortled the
other; “Eastern mail boat was due here at six-ten
this morning; the Pitcairn Aviation concern
handle that route, as well as the run between
Atlanta and Miami down in Florida; and I’m
telling you for a fact the boys holding the stick
with <i>that</i> corporation are nearly always on time
to the dot, come storm, come fog as thick as
pea-soup. The schedule I glimpsed at the Atlanta
post office gave the time of the East Coast
ship as seven-thirty P. M.; that from New Orleans
at six-thirty P. M.; and the one from
Chicago about the same time. So you see it
couldn’t be a mail crate dropping down right
now, unless they’d had to make a forced landing,
and lost time in making repairs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, come to think of it I sure did hear a
bus passin’ over just at peep o’ day,” admitted
Perk. “Let’s have a look-in while we’re here,
and see what a bag o’ tricks these stunt flyers
are holdin’ up their sleeves, so’s to give this
crowd a row o’ thrills.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suits me, Perk; no great hurry about our
jumping off, so long as we pull the gun before
dark sets in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! little difference it makes on a patch
as well lighted as this Candler Field o’ your
home city, old boy; and with a flashlight beacon
set every ten miles all the way down to Orleans,
to keep us on our course. Look at that guy
fairly burning the air like hot cakes—he must
be tryin’ to beat the speed record, I guess, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hardly a day comes without some record
going by the board,” remarked Jack, who had
a reputation as a safe and sane pilot, although
on occasion he had been known to put through
some tricks so death-defying as to make the
hearts of the spectators seem to jump up in
their throats with the thrill.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was quite correct when he stated that
Atlanta was the home city of his close friend
and chum; although Jack’s family had moved
away years back, and become fruit raisers in
far-off California. Still, having spent some
years in the Georgia capital Jack always liked
to drop in and renew a limited number of old
friendships when opportunity offered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack Ralston had begun his aviation work
starting at the lowest round, that of a Gypsy
pilot, flying an ancient boat at County Fairs and
Harvest Home gatherings; doing aerial stunts,
and “bailing out” by means of a parachute while
another pilot ran the ship; also taking up air
minded “sand-bags” as passengers at so much
each person.</p>

<p class='c013'>From this modest beginning he had finally
accepted a position with an aircraft corporation
having contracts with the Post Office Department
at Washington for carrying the mails, and
later on express matter as well; and last of all
working for Uncle Sam through joining the
Secret Service corps of skillful detectives, whose
activities covered every part of the Nation, and
even to adjacent countries as well.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the Government wearied of the bold
doings of one “Slippery Slim” Garrabrant, and
decided to “clip the wings” of that audacious
freebooter and bogus-money crook, it was only
natural they should pick Jack for this service.
The reasons for doing so were many, but what
counted most was Jack’s well known cleverness
as an all-round air pilot; for it happened that
the slick rogue who had been giving the revenue
men such a wild-goose chase, with his thumb
held up to his nose, so to speak, was himself a
remarkable master of the air lanes, he having
been an ace as a flying pilot over with the army
on the Argonne front in France.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since as a rule this troublesome offender carried
on his bold enterprises by means of a handy
plane—frequently with a single assistant, who
helped handle both ship and cargo—the man
thus selected to put a crimp in his activities was
likewise given full permission to engage a helper
from the same arm of the Government forces,
one who must of course know something about
the handling of a plane, so that in case of necessity
he could serve as co-pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack lost no time in picking Gabe Perkiser,
otherwise known simply as “Perk”—a man who
had supped with adventure since he was “knee
high to a duck”—a half Yankee—half Canuck,
drifting into the army, and serving with the
sausage observation balloon corps over in
France; from which patriotic occupation he
later on became a champion light-weight boxer.
Leaving the ring while as yet undefeated he
served for several years with the Canadian
Mounted Police. Here his smartness in usually
fetching back his man, no matter what the difficulties
that had to be surmounted, attracted
the attention of a gentleman connected with
Uncle Sam’s Secret Service, just then moose
hunting over the northern border, who finally
influenced Perk to join up with his force.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and the other had met under peculiar
conditions when both were tracking a bunch of
check raisers floating across the country and
leaving a wide swath of victims in their path.
They had become more than friends, although
meeting but seldom; then, when the opportunity
came for Jack to call upon Perk to join him in
the new job that had been turned over to his
charge, the latter had responded with alacrity.</p>

<p class='c013'>So here they were, on the threshold of an
affair that promised to engage their united talents
in running down the leader of the most
troublesome gang of counterfeit currency makers
known to the Government agents in the last
ten years.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every clue possessed at Headquarters had
been turned over to Jack at the time he was
given authority to carry on as the situation demanded;
although this information was a bit
limited, and much was left to the shrewdness
of the two trail hounds themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no hurry at all, and Jack had
always been one of those cautious workers who
meant to provide for all sorts of emergencies.
Only too well did he know how many a splendid
undertaking went on the rocks from lack of
foreseeing the next move on the part of the
astute criminals whose apprehension meant so
much to the Government, as well as the folks
they were victimizing.</p>

<p class='c013'>But by now he had decided everything was
arranged so far as human means would permit,
and that it was high time they started on their
long chase. Their boat, a Stinson Detroiter, a
monoplane with a Wright Whirlwind motor,
and reckoned to be an unusually swift craft, was
already loaded, and ready for immediate departure.
It had been stored in one of the big
hangars connected with the Candler Flying
Field but could be taxied into position when
Jack felt ready to skip off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their flying togs were also contained in a
locker in the same hangar, and could be donned
in a jiffy, even to the ’chute harness that was
so familiar to Jack, and a constant reminder of
early experiences when he was accustomed to
carry out his daily program of “quitting the
ship” with as much <i>sang froid</i> as though the
jump into space from a five thousand foot ceiling
were absolutely next to nothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>But plainly Perk was becoming a bit restless,
as though eager to be on his way; which fact
doubtless influenced Jack to eventually give the
word that took them to their hangar. Here
they commenced preparing for a night flight
that was expected to land them in New Orleans,
where Jack was to interview a certain representative
of the Government service, from whom
he anticipated receiving a few valuable tips that
would give them something tangible and serve
as a beginning of their arduous chase.</p>

<p class='c013'>While they were thus engaged someone
hailed them with a boisterous greeting, at which
Perk grinned, and made a suitable reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hey, Scotty, this your night off, is it—got
in from your route okay, and stepped out to see
the boys cut a few figger-eights in the sky—just
can’t keep away from the game, even when you
got a lay-off? What’s new, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They told me at the house you expected to
step off tonight, boys—is that a fact, or did they
slip an easy one over me, I want to know?” demanded
the other, who was apparently a mail
pilot friend of theirs—in fact, having the adjoining
room at the small hotel where they were
stopping.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” Jack told him, secretive as usual,
“we’re going further, and boosting the Stinson
Detroiter ship by showing what it has to set it
above most other boats. Plans not fully arranged
as yet, but we’re on our way; so it’s good-bye,
and good luck to you, Scotty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about that news, Scotty?” the insistent
Perk went on to demand, being by nature one of
those stubborn chaps who can never be happy
until they get what they are after, no matter
how trivial it may seem.</p>

<p class='c013'>The air mail pilot scratched his head, and
then with a grin answered Perk’s question.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much along the line of aviation;
but something queer happened to me—say, did
you boys sleep at home last night while I was
on the road?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We sure did,” Perk told him, and then
added: “What makes you ask that, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Didn’t hear any sort of racket in my den
did you, fellows?” continued the other; at which
Perk, after exchanging a look of bewilderment
with his pal, hastened to answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a thing, Scotty; but then you know I
sleep like a log; and it’d have to be a thunderclap
to wake me up; what’s been going on?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You got me guessing, Perk,” said the other,
with a look of disgust; “only when I got in this
morning I found my room looking like a hurricane
had struck it, my things tossed out of drawers,
my trunk broken open, and say, you never
saw such a dirty mess. Course I asked the boss
what it meant; but he was as much surprised
as I was—talked with every servant from the
cook down to Mary the chamber maid; but
nobody could tell a darned thing about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again Jack and Perk exchanged a swift
glance, as though the same idea had struck both
of them. Scotty did not appear to notice this,
being too worked up with the mystery that had
so suddenly gripped his fortunes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did you lose anything worth while, Scotty?”
Jack asked, in a voice that suggested sympathy;
but to his surprise the other shook his head in
the negative, and even grinned as he lifted his
heavy eyebrows to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s the funny part of it, boys; whoever
the sneak thief was, he didn’t even dent me a
little bit—so far as I c’n see not a blessed thing
is missing—fact is, I’m even better off than before
he paid that queer visit, ’cause he left this
old pocketbook mixed up with my traps; and
it ain’t mine for a fact, though I’m meaning to
spend the little wad of dough it holds. Like
manna coming down to the children of Israel
in the Wilderness, wouldn’t you say, boys?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lucky old hoss you are, Scotty,” remarked
Perk, enviously; while Jack nodded his head as
though to echo the sentiment.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c014'>CHAPTER II <br /> <br />THE LUCK OF SCOTTY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Happen to have that pocketbook along with
you, Scotty?” asked Jack, in a matter of fact
tone; just as though he might be possessed of
ordinary curiosity concerning so amazing a
visit; since never before had he heard of a night
prowler leaving his own money behind him,
when his intention had been to rob his victim.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing, Jack,” promptly replied the air
mail pilot; “here, take a squint at my Christmas
present, dropped in by old Santa Claus
a bit before the reg’lar holiday season,” and with
a laugh he chucked the object in question into
the hand of the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Old, just as you remarked, Scotty,” observed
Jack, “and used a long time. It must have
slipped out of his pocket when he worked your
stuff over to mix it up like the devil.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Open it up and see what the blessed chump
left me in place of his card,” the other continued,
looking exceedingly proud over his lucky
find.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did that with alacrity; in fact it
was what he intended doing, for reasons of his
own; something more than curiosity influencing
him, it would appear.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gee whiz! a neat little bunch of the needful,
I’d say, Scotty, old hoss!” burst out the envious
Perk, his eyes fixed full upon the contents of
the much worn pocketbook, which Jack was
holding in his hand and apparently interested
in counting, for there were a number of bank
notes for various amounts, and among them just
three five-dollar bills, seemingly quite fresh,
though a bit soiled, as though they had been in
circulation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nineteen smackers in all,” announced Perk,
showing that he had also been keeping tabs on
the count. “Well, wouldn’t that knock you cold
though? Huh? that same caller must’ve been
looking for <i>me</i>, and just missed connections by
striking the next door. Well, here’s wishing you
the same old luck every time a sneak thief pays
you a visit, Scotty boy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack on his part was feeling of the three five-dollar
bills, and holding them up to the light
from the western sun that managed to come
into the hangar by way of the open doors.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What ails you, Jack?” demanded the recipient
of Fortune’s smiles, as he noticed these
strange actions on the part of his new friend.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much,” he was told, “only I’m going
to give you a bit of advice, partner, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to it, boy; always willing to take it
when it seems sound!” snapped the mail carrier,
briskly enough, still more than curious.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you’re wise, Scotty,” went on Jack, smilingly,
“you’ll not try to pass any one of these
five-dollar bills until you’ve asked the opinion
of some bank teller—it might get you into
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Zowie! what’s that you’re saying, Jack—don’t
tell me they’re off-color bills, counterfeits
in fact. Wouldn’t that be a rotten deal to hand
out, and me figgering how I’d spend them? Is
<i>that</i> what you mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon it’s so, Scotty, much as I hate to
knock your good luck,” Jack told him, with a
shake of his head. “I happened to have a little
experience in a small bank some years ago and
they did say I showed signs of being a clever
detector of bad money. That’s a clever job all
right; but I’m afraid it won’t stand the wash
worth a cent. Go slow, and don’t count your
chickens before they’re hatched. Also I’d advise
you not to go around telling about your windfall
until you’ve shown this stuff to some friendly
bank official, whose advice you’d be willing to
take. If he says it’s good stuff why forget what
I’m saying, and go the limit. But we’d better
be finishing our own job, Perk, and get off on
our jump.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Scotty hung around for a short time, looking
puzzled, as though he hardly knew how much
to believe. What Jack had said in his friendly
fashion had doubtless cast quite a damper on
certain bright dreams in which he had been indulging.
However, he finally decided to take
himself off, evidently eager to know whether
the laugh was on him or not, for he called out:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goodbye, Jack, Perk; and be sure to look me
up when next you drop in at Candler Field Airport;
like as not I’ll still be on my old job here,
unless they decide to transfer me somewhere else.
And say, Jack, I’m meaning to take your advice,
and get an opinion on this here stuff ’fore I try
to pass it out on any old duffer. So-long boys
and luck!”</p>

<p class='c013'>When the two comrades, adventure bound,
found themselves alone they looked at each other
in silence for almost a full minute, when a grin
started to travel over Perk’s well bronzed face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, wouldn’t it jar you though, to have such
luck knock at your door, and then give you a sly
kick?” he demanded of his companion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To tell the honest truth, Perk, I’m not thinking
about Scotty and his queer windfall; it’s
our own great good luck that’s making me suspect
we’re bound to carry this job through with
flying colors.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Eh? now what d’ye mean by saying that?”
asked the other hastily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right in the beginning, Perk, we seem to
have stumbled on a nice little plum in the shape
of a clue—flung directly at our heads, you might
say in the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! do you mean to tell me those bogus
notes were off the same plates we’ve been
hearing so much about lately that I’ve been
dreamin’ I was tied hand an’ foot, an’ poked
under a dozen bales of them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just that, as sure as you live, partner,” said
Jack, composedly; but if he could take it so
coolly, not so his right bower who showed signs
of extreme excitement and satisfaction, for he
thrust out his hand, that had so often been an
object of vast respect on the part of some welter
weight boxer, and insisted that Jack accept a
gentle shake.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re sure Fortune’s favorites,” Perk was
saying, striking an attitude as he thus proudly
spoke; “an’ with such luck hoverin’ over our
heads I vow all the Lower Regions with its devils
can’t prevail against us. But see here, old hoss,
there’s more than chance in this break o’ the
party who broke through Scotty’s door, and
panned all his traps—I guess now he must have
missed a cylinder, an’ jest passed us by in a
ground loop.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was accustomed to the other’s quaint way
of expressing himself, for he lost no time in
adding:</p>

<p class='c013'>“About that way, I take it, Perk. And if
what we suspect turns out to be true, it stands to
reason there’s some sort of big combine back of
it all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“With this same Slippery Slim Garrabrant
pulling the wires for the whole bunch, is that
what you mean, Jack?” demanded the other flyer
quickly; for when once set on the right track
Perk’s mind could travel speedily enough.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s certainly his brain that’s built up this
wide flim-flam trade in the make believe green
stuff that’s been fooling a whole lot of bank tellers,
it’s so near the genuine article. To
smash the combine we’ve got to check up on
Slim; after he’s caged the entire arrangement’s
bound to fall through.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, partner; and them’s my sentiments
every time,” admitted the eager Perk. “And
here, when we’re starting out to pull off our
fresh stunt, I’m wishing all the luck that’s going
to our little game. Meaning to give her a last
checking over, eh, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s a habit of mine, as you know, Perk; and
you might amuse yourself stowing the cargo
we’ve taken aboard, so’s to let us have room for
our feet when we take off. From the looks of
the junk you picked up anybody’d reckon we
planned to go into camp for a week or two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, mebbe that’s what’ll happen to us before
we strike pay dirt in this ticklish job,”
asserted Perk, stoutly. “You know we figgered
things out, and made up our minds this same
slick article of a Slim might have his hangout
over the line in Old Mexico, where he prints
his bad bills, and then comes across the line with
a big bunch in his ship, so’s to scatter the stuff
around to his agents in Texas and Arizona, or
it might be all through Southern California. If
that guess turns out to be a bullseye we might
be away off the line of travel for days at a stretch,
and a grub stake’d turn the trick okay, I’m thinking,
boss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack made no reply, for he was already busily
engaged in looking over his crate. This was, as
he had mentioned, an old habit, contracted in
the early days of his career as an aviator of sorts;
and most likely such extreme caution had saved
his life more than once.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he too worked close by, Perk was thinking
more or less about something that had caught
his ever watchful eye just before they entered
the hangar to make these last preparations for
their southern flight. As usual he was unable
to keep his speculations entirely to himself, since
he always liked to compare notes, and find out
whether his companion’s views coincided with
his own.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, Jack, did you happen to notice that
Ryan ship they’d just taken out of the shed before
ours?” he demanded, while still lifting
packages of various supplies, and stowing them
away in a shipshape fashion; so they would not
be likely to shift, and thus imperil the safety
of himself and comrade, should they chance to
encounter rough weather later on.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not particularly,” came the answer. “I was
too busy over my own affairs to bother with anything
that didn’t concern me in the least. What
of it, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much, old hoss, only it was a next
to new bus, and hadn’t been flown more’n a few
thousand air miles, I’d guess. Couple of fellers
seemed to be the crew, one of ’em lookin’ like
he might be a pilot; and the other a chap that
was out to have a jolly good time sportin’ for
sport. I saw him handlin’ some sort of gun,
which made me guess he was down South for
the shootin’ season—mebbe after bear in the
Louisiana canebrakes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack laughed as if amused, for he had noted
the way in which the other made this stab at
what might be the designs of the unknown
parties.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Feel a bit envious I take it, Perk,” he observed,
laconically. “Always did yearn for the
day to come when you’d have a ship of your
own, and could spend all your spare time jumping
about the country, enjoying yourself with
rod and gun. Cheer up, old sport, you may live
to see that day yet, if things break right for us
in a few big games like this one we’re running
down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thanks for your good luck wishes, Jack,” the
other was saying; “I c’n just picture the bully
times that pair’ll like enough have sitting by
their camp-fire, living on game they’ve knocked
over, and not caring a darn whether school
keeps or not. Oh! well, if I live long enough
mebbe I may have a whiff of that kind of life
before I kick off for keeps; they say everything
comes to the man who waits, and that’s me.
There, that finishes my job, with everything
stowed away as slick as you please. When you’re
ready, Jack, we’ll be on our way.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c014'>CHAPTER III <br /> <br />HEADED SOUTH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Apparently Jack had completed his task
about the same time, for he was adjusting his
’chute harness, without which he seldom made a
long distance flight. This was only second nature
to him, because of the long experience he
had had in barnstorming, and doing stunts for
a living in years gone by.</p>

<p class='c013'>This accomplished, he stepped outside the
hangar, and beckoned to a couple of ground
workers who chanced to be close by, possibly
in anticipation of their services being required,
with a tip in prospect.</p>

<p class='c013'>Between them the ship was moved to the open,
and after that it would be a simple thing for
Jack to taxi across the strip of ground adjoining
the big Pitcairn hangar, so as to face such
wind as was stirring.</p>

<p class='c013'>With what Perk had said concerning the new
Ryan monoplane and its crew still fresh in his
mind, Jack did give a brief glance in that quarter.
He could only see that both men were fully
equipped with dungarees, helmets, and even
chutes fastened to their backs; which combination
was an effectual disguise, since their best
friends might have failed to recognize either
of them offhand.</p>

<p class='c013'>The one who was garbed in what seemed to
be fresh clean overalls, and who must be the
employer, seemed to feel a mild interest in their
movements, for he was looking that way through
his goggles, that had been pulled down as if in
preparation for some species of flight. The
other was busying himself adjusting something,
and from his greasy dungarees it was evident
he must be the working pilot of the Ryan craft.</p>

<p class='c013'>With all the bustle that was going on covering
the stunt flying and speed races, Jack did
not bother taking a second look; he failed to
have the same interest in the possible sporting
excursion of the unknown pair that had gripped
Perk and hence failed to let the matter occupy
any more of his limited time.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon both settled down in their respective
places in the double cockpit of the ship,
Jack of course occupying the front seat, since
he had been placed in command, with the other
acting as co-pilot and observer.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a very decent crate taken in all, that
had been secured for their work on this special
occasion, for Uncle Sam is never stingy in supplying
his agents of the Secret Service with
whatever they need, from means for swift travel
to the customary “grub” necessary to their upkeep
when “on the road.” These air detectives
in whom we are particularly interested just now,
as a rule were angling for big fish, and it was
absolutely necessary they should be given a free
hand when making their demands for proper
backing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it’s goodbye to Candler Field for us
right now,” remarked Perk, as he shot a general
look around, being more or less interested in
the exciting events being pulled off in the air
circus. “Playtime’s past, and now we’ve just
got to put in our best licks along the line of
business. Huh! seems like them two guys are
meaning to pull out right on our heels, from the
lively way that greasy lad is jumping around—keeps
an eye on us in the bargain, as if it mattered
a lick whether we did get going before
he was ready to follow suit. Some folks never
do like anybody to show ’em their dust, even
when it don’t matter a pinch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then Jack waved his hand toward the two
hostlers whom he had generously tipped, and
pulled the gun in his accustomed careful fashion;
after which they started along the level
field for the takeoff, there being small necessity
for a runway on such a generous fairway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Faster and faster they flew along the ground,
and then with their wheels parting contact with
the earth up they started at an easy incline.
The roar of the motor already drowned most of
the clamor from the surging crowd, while the
racket of the whizzing propeller added to the
chorus so joyous to the ears of all real air pilots,
since nothing pleases them more than to feel they
are masters of a ship that is in “apple-pie” condition
for battling whatever lies ahead, be it
storm, fog or whatnot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Somehow Perk was twisting his head around
as if curious to ascertain whether that Ryan
crate had succeeded in imitating their example,
and was already making the preliminary dash
across the field—which luckily enough had
chanced to be fairly clear of maneuvering
planes, either descending, taking off, or being
taxied into position for the next stunt on the
program.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was getting well along by this
time, and already the first dim shadows of approaching
night were to be seen slipping
out from certain patches of pine trees ahead.
But the higher they climbed, now that a start
had been accomplished, the lighter it would become,
what with a lower horizon, and the sun
still hanging in plain sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once free from any possibility of any contact
with the wheeling and ducking planes—some of
which were doing the barrel roll, and others
making successive somersaults, with the daring
pilots proceeding while in an inverted position—Jack
could start spiraling, and climbing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rapidly was Candler Field fading from view
behind them since Jack had swung toward the
south, as if to lay his course directly for New
Orleans. Perk seemed to find a subtle attraction
back where they had just come from, since he
was again turning his head with nothing else to
do save gratify his innocent curiosity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! ’pears like they might be meaning to
strike for the Louisiana canebrake country, and
black bear diggings, just like I said,” he was
telling himself, with a chuckle of amusement
over his shrewd guess. “And say, that little
Ryan crate’s no slouch ’bout making speed, I’d
mention. Come along you sportin’ crowd—plenty
of room in the ceiling overhead, an’ nixey
a chance to bring about a collision. Take your
choice, and cut out for all you’re worth, boys.
If you get there before we do, just tell ’em we’re
acomin’ too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk continued to amuse himself in watching
the antics of the rival ship, and indulging in
all kinds of wild speculations as to what the real
object of those two sporty looking occupants
might prove to be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently thus far not the slightest suspicion
had entered his mind that the taking to the air
of the shining Ryan boat had the first thing to
do with their own skipping out, and heading
toward the Crescent City.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like as not when it gets real dark after a
bit,” Perk continued to say, being addicted to
talking to himself more or less, “we’ll soon lose
her, and have the field all to ourselves. Only
moving thing I c’n sight back there, ’cept them
circlin’ buzzards huntin’ for a carrion supper.
Guess everything’s going along first class
and we’re in for a comfortable night run down
over the corn and sugarcane country. This is
the life for little Perk, you hear me saying,
everybody—it’s got the boxin’ game, and even
that outdoor life up with the Mounties in Canada,
beat to a frazzle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk busied himself with his duties for
some time, and presently became aware of the
fact that evening was actually at hand; for the
sun had dropped out of sight over in the far
west, and looking down he found it absolutely
impossible to distinguish what lay beneath them
some two thousand feet more or less earthward—there
might be forests, farms, hills or swales
following each other in rapid succession; but all
masked by the sable curtains of night. When
the moon rose later on, its light would not afford
them any opportunity for marking any peculiarities
of the ground down there, since it must
simply present the appearance of a swiftly moving
panorama.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, moved once more by his old curiosity
concerning the ship that had started off immediately
after their own jump, again twisted his
head so as to take another backward look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hanged if she ain’t keeping on our tail right
along,” he told himself, as if a bit surprised,
though not in the least troubled, since there
could be no possible connection between this
Ryan monoplane and their own old bus, bent
on reeling off so many miles per hour, and aiming
to make the airport at New Orleans by early
dawn or before, according to how the weather
treated them, and the speed Jack could coax
from his aerial steed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Further inspection convinced Perk that the
rival ship was neither gaining nor losing as the
two sped along their way; a fact that began to
make him “sit up and take notice,” and then
express himself confidentially:</p>

<p class='c013'>“By jinks! it looks to me like that clever little
Ryan bus could make circles around our tub
’less Jack c’n squeeze a lot more snap from our
Whirlwind motor. Now what game c’n that
pair of sports be playin’ right now, I want to
know—must be they’re so used to bettin’ on
anything an’ everything they’re meanin’ to keep
right on our tail all night long, just to make us
hump along, and get the laugh on us poor
guys.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c014'>CHAPTER IV <br /> <br />THE GRIM PURSUER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>As the minutes crept along Perk’s uneasiness
commenced to make itself more manifest, finally
reaching such a condition that he felt it would
ease his mind if only he could get the opinion
of his companion on the subject.</p>

<p class='c013'>To do this it would be necessary that they
should make use of the head earphones that had
been taken along for this particular purpose.
Accordingly he quickly adjusted his own, and
then proceeded to advise Jack as to what he
wished to do. Since these useful adjuncts of the
pilot’s outfit were so arranged that they could
be slipped on and off with little loss of time,
it was an easy matter for Perk to apply them,
after which he went on to speak.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, seems like that pesky little Ryan insect’s
been tailing us right along, though mebbe
now you didn’t notice it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know it, Perk—fact is I proved that fact
to my own satisfaction, for twice now I’ve
changed our course, once into the west, and
again heading into the southwest, even if it
didn’t catch your attention.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You did that same; and say, what happened,
Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a blessed thing,” came the immediate
answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They still hung on our tail, do you mean,
old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like they did—queer how two pilots,
strangers both, would take a notion to change
their course, not once but twice running,” commented
Jack in his non-committal fashion that
always had Perk guessing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Strikes me as something more than a happy
chance,” asserted Perk, beginning to throw off
that comfortable feeling with which he had
wrapped himself as he contemplated a steady
going night run, with never a reason for anything
gripping them by way of excitement;
“ev’ry little movement of that Ryan two-seater’s
got a meanin’ of its own. Now what ails the
ducks I want to know—how c’n our movements
have a mite to do with what they’re planning
to carry out—got any idea along them lines, old
hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing definite as yet,” answered Jack; “I
was starting to figure it out just when you barged
in, and opened this talk fest up with your question.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, come to think of it, what did you make
out of that stiff yarn Scotty put over on us a
while ago?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was raw stuff for a fact; but I don’t question
anything he told us, remember, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whoever his mysterious visitor was he must
have been hunting for something, that’s dead
sure!” declared Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Something he didn’t find, either,” continued
Jack’s assistant pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Scotty was ready to swear to that fact, and
he ought to know.” Jack countered by saying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“But see here, old hoss, you’ve got some sorter
idea what the game might abeen, haven’t you
for a fact?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon I know why the sneak thief failed
to carry away the thing he was looking for, if
that’s what you mean, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As what, boss—I’m all worked up wantin’
to know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perhaps the reason might have been because
the object of his search happened at that very
time to be safe and snug in the inside pocket
of this same coat I’m wearing under my overalls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At hearing this startling announcement Perk
gave a quick look into his pal’s face, there being
just enough light remaining in the western sky
to allow this searching glance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! now I’m beginning to get somewhere,
and ready to quit this gropin’ around,
like a man in a London fog—that letter you had
this very morning from Headquarters—somehow
’r other some of the gang had wind of your
gettin’ it, and they guessed it’d be kept
safe under lock and key in your room at the
hotel; and then they got balled up about the
number on the door, so they broke into the wrong
room. Jack, am I on the right track?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems that’s so, according to my notion,
Perk; unless I miss my guess that’s the way
things stand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A disgusted grunt from Perk told that he did
not feel very happy over certain facts in the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gosh-a-mighty!” he burst out, explosively,
“if that’s right, then the tricky crowd know you’n
me are on this case—that even right now we’re
starting out to pluck their tail feathers, and
fetch that master-crook to the bar!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! I expected that would happen,” said
Jack, indifferently. “Having been told by several
of the best men in the service that Slim was
the smartest all-round dopester known in all the
land, I anticipated that he’d have means for
finding out that fact long ago—that there might
be a leak around Headquarters; for spies can
worm in almost anywhere, given an opportunity,
and the backing of a big bunch of jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yet that fact don’t seem to rattle you worth
a red cent, old hoss,” continued the puzzled
Perk, who ofttimes found the actions of his cool
partner a mystery he could not solve, because of
his own more impetuous ways.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope not,” was all Jack said in reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thunder and lightning!” ejaculated the co-pilot,
as if an illuminating idea had suddenly
flashed through his brain—“that Ryan bus,
Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what of it?” demanded the one at the
stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What if that sporty guy I told you about
should turn out to be the critter who broke into
Scotty’s room, and made it a complete wreck?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It could happen that way, Perk; seems like
you’re working on a warm scent right now. Pity
we didn’t get a good look at the gentleman before
he hid his face behind that helmet and goggles;
then at least we’d know him if ever we happened
to run across his trail.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The other was almost frothing at the mouth
through disgust and anger combined; but he
managed to say, with a select few hard words
interlarded as a vent to his outraged feelings:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Give me half a chance and I’ll mark him so
there’s be no difficulty in locating the sneak when
we meet him again—I’d put a bit of lead
through his arm that’d keep him out of the scrap
for a week of Sundays; or else clip off one of
his ears, to stamp him as a low-down crook.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack knew full well that this was no idle threat
on the part of his running mate; for Perk had a
reputation as a pistol shot second to none in the
entire service, being a natural born marksman.</p>

<p class='c013'>He lapsed into a spell of silence after making
that vicious remark; but from the way he
glanced back again and again it looked as
though Perk meant to keep close tabs on the
craft that was dogging their own ship so
steadily.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were roaring on their way, and it would
seem as if they must be showing a clean pair of
heels to anything in their rear; but just the same,
Perk, with the vision of an air-minded individual,
could readily understand how the speedy
Ryan plane was slowly but insidiously picking
up on them continuously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blamed nuisance,” he was muttering to himself
when this important fact became a positive
truth; “guess now that rip-snorter could make
circles round us, if so be he wanted to. Shucks!
what’s left to us I want to know; an’ just what
does he ’spect to accomplish with all this chasin’
us? Might as well get out my little old
six-shot bear gun, so’s to be ready in case
there’s any sort o’ ruction aheadin’ our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The idea seemed to afford him a strange sort
of grim satisfaction, for bending down he ran
his hand under the coaming of the cockpit; to
almost immediately withdraw a very decent
looking sporting repeating rifle, evidently his
working tool whenever he felt disposed to spend
a week in the wilds, either alone, or with some
boon companions also yearning for wild game
and the much desired campfire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold tight, Perk,” Jack was saying just
then; “going into a nose dive, and see if that
will upset his calculations; for he’s got me buffaloed
all right as to what’s in the wind!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Almost immediately they turned the nose of
their craft earthward, and went down on a
swift slant. Perk kept his head turned even as
this maneuvre was being executed, and what he
saw was something calculated to almost take
his breath away; for where the pursuing Ryan
ship loomed up as a shadowy form, vivid
splashes, as of fire, were coming in quick succession—he
could even imagine he heard the pulsating
staccato reports following each other in
succession, just as in those never-to-be-forgotten
days when he would have a covey of
devil-may-care German air fighters stepping on
the tail of his old-fashioned boat, and peppering
him from their rapid-firing guns!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c014'>CHAPTER V <br /> <br />THE DUEL IN THE AIR</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The significant flashes abruptly ceased; but
Perk realized this was only because the expert
pilot handling that same Ryan wasp was also
ducking down in an exact copy of their own
game.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the moment Perk lost sight of the shadowy
pursuing craft; then Jack changed his tactics,
and once again brought his boat on an even
keel. Perk strained his eyesight in an endeavor
to pick up the other ship after it too had swung
into a direct course.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Devil take that guy at the stick,” he stormed
to himself, although Jack caught almost every
word, since the earphones were still in operation,
“he’s seen our move, an’ gone us one better.
No slouch o’ a pilot, either, I’ll admit. When
that gent who goes by the name o’ Slippery Slim
picks his gang he knows how to pull trumps
out of the pack all right. Give him another
shoot, Jack, old hoss; mebbe he wont be so lucky
next time. He’s got some kind o’ a rapid-fire
shooter aboard, and had started to send a hail
o’ lead ’bout our ears just as you turned the trick
on him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was apparently quite willing to give a
repeat, for hardly had the other ceased shouting
than they again shot down in a dizzy dive
that seemed likely to lower their altitude by
something like five hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was keeping a close watch, and knew
that once more the grim pursuer had copied
their daring maneuvre.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s a good one, or I’ll eat my hat!” he burst
out, as they were “cutting a blue streak” once
more through the growing darkness, and he
could see those suggestive flashes again punctuating
the gloom in their track. “Jack, he’s
started that racket again, don’t you know; and
any second we may get a slug in our belly, bustin’
things all to flinders. Try a razzle-dazzle on
the boob, old broncho!”</p>

<p class='c013'>So making a bank, Jack changed his course,
running at right angles, and if anything at a
faster pace than ever. Perk had the situation
“sized up to a fraction,” as he himself would
have called it; he realized that it was only
through the greatest of good luck they had escaped
being hit by one of those flying missiles;
and that so long as the mysterious enemy kept
using their ship for a flying target they were in
constant peril. Despite all this ducking and
dodging on Jack’s part he did not seem successful
in throwing the pursuing craft off the track.
To be sure the darkness was gradually growing
thicker with every passing minute, and this
seemed to be their only hope of crawling out of
a “hot hole,” according to Perk’s calculations.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk afterwards frankly admitted that he was
frothing at the mouth on account of finding himself
up against a situation where the cards
seemed stacked against him—where his hands
were tied as it were, and that reckless pilot, chasing
after them hell-bent, held all the trumps.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No use tryin’ that game any longer, Jack,
boy!” he yelled suddenly. “See the glim all
’round us, partner—sure as you live they’ve
even got some kind o’ a searchlight aboard, just
like they’d planned all this thing out beforehand.
Guess now it’s up to Little Perk to put
a plug into their game. Hold her steady a bit,
boss; I’m meaning to make ’em sit up an’ take
notice they can’t hog <i>all</i> the fun going. Watch
my smoke, Jack, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a delicate situation without any doubt;
for if those aboard that little Ryan plane, taking
advantage of the halo of light covering the craft
they followed, continued to make use of their
rapidfire gun, the danger of a hit had vastly increased;
but Perk must have some sort of scheme
in mind it was evident, or he would never have
asked his chum to steady the badly wobbling
boat when such action only doubled their peril.</p>

<p class='c013'>Calmly and deliberately, as though simply
bent on fetching down a deer he wanted for
his next camp supper, steady old Perk had his
faithful gun up to his shoulder, and was sighting
that piercing glare of light that marked the bow
of the pursuing aircraft, betraying the presence
of a searchlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Possibly owing to the clamor of their own
working motor Jack could not tell when his
companion unloosed a fusilade of shots; but he
did know that something suddenly changed the
situation, and to their advantage; for as though
a blanket had been tossed over the piercing
ray the illumination abruptly ceased, leaving
them to continue their wild flight shrouded in
encompassing darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, too, the sound of Perk’s exulting yell
was quite enough to tell the story of his success
in finding a glowing target for one of his several
missiles—the old sharpshooter had evidently
lost none of his cunning by reason of a lapse in
action.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Set ’em up in the other alley, boys—give your
Dutch uncle a chance to show an old trick or
two! Now <i>will</i> you be good, or must I give
you another smash in the jaw—better haul off
while the haulin’s good, fellers—I’d sure hate to
make you crack up, and fade out!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Even though his clever shot had doubtless
utterly smashed the searchlight, and put it out
of business, that bothersome rapidfire gun was
still in working order, as Perk discovered when
once more those insistent flashes, following closely
upon each others’ heels, announced a fresh
barrage, with the unseen, unheard hissing bullets
doubtless whizzing all around them.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was adding insult to injury, Perk was
doubtless telling himself, as he realized that his
lucky shot had after all failed to daunt that
stubborn pair in the speedy Ryan ship.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You <i>will</i> have it, seems like,” he growled
to himself; for since he had discarded his earphone
harness just previous to starting his late
“shooting spree,” Perk could no longer hold
intercourse with his fellow flyer; “all right then,
I’ll try some more o’ the same sorter medicine;
what’s good for the goose orter be fine for the
gander. Mind your eye now, boys, and keep
a tight grip on your chutes if anything happens
not down in your gamble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again did the continual flash of spitting fire
from the gun afford the sharpshooter in the
chased ship abundant opportunities for focussing
his aim; although instinct may have
taken the place of vision on Perk’s part.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fortunately Jack must have been expecting
something along those lines, knowing his companion
so well, and how he was always eager
to “repeat” when things were coming his way;
for he kept the flying boat wonderfully steady
just then, even though realizing how such action
doubled their own chances of being hit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was now shooting on general principles,
in hopes of being fortunate enough to find a
billet for one of his random bullets. He went
at the business with all the <i>sang froid</i> of a veteran
fighter, accustomed to meeting hostile
craft up in the wide air spaces, or even above
the clouds—all the fierce delight of matching
his skill and life against a foeman worthy of his
steel had once more gripped the old flying warrior;
and it may be for the moment he deluded
himself with the belief that this was but a reincarnation
of those never-to-be-forgotten days
when all Europe was held fast in the throes of
the grisly war-god.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly Perk ceased firing, nor was this
caused by the magazine of his repeating rifle
being empty—he had seen that the discharges
back yonder were no longer in full blast, showing
that something must have happened to cause
such a sudden cessation to hostilities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before he could attempt to analyze what this
might mean it was all flashed before his questioning
mind—a burst of flames came from the
spot where last he had seen the shadowy shape
of their persistent pursuer clipping through
space like a blazing meteor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk sat there doubled up, his mouth half
open, staring with might and main, as some
object began to drop toward the earth with ever
increasing speed—something which he knew
full well must of necessity be the beautiful little
Ryan plane, which he had admired so much
when at Candler Field at close of the late day,
and before this wild dash into the darkness of
night began.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently one of his missiles (fired with such
grim determination when he “took the bit in
his teeth,” and struck back) had found its mark,
and unleashed the dangerous contents of the
gasoline reservoir, with the splashing fluid instantly
catching fire from the exploding spark
of the running motor.</p>

<p class='c013'>No flyer ever saw his enemy going down in a
flaming coffin without feeling compassion gripping
him; that one moment had changed his
heart from bitter hatred to a sense of pity; knowing
as he must have done that the day might
be near at hand when he too would share in a
similar dreadful fate.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so Perk found himself all in a nervous
tremble as, laying down his gun, he managed
once more to adjust the head harness, so as to
be able to again hold communication with his
fellow adventurer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c014'>CHAPTER VI <br /> <br />PARACHUTE JUMPERS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Just then Jack hurriedly banked, and swung
around as though to double back on their late
course. This of course told Perk the pilot must
be already aware of the terrible tragedy that
was being enacted close at hand, and meant to
see its finish with his own eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the abrupt change in their course he
was in time to catch a glimpse of the flaming
object still spiraling earthwards, a billow of fire
that glowed suggestively in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then far below it seemed to strike the ground—they
heard no sound whatever, but the fire
became stationary; although increasing in fury,
since the wind created by its passage no longer
whipped the devouring flames. Evidently by
the time the conflagration stopped for want of
further material on which to feed, nothing inflammable
would be left of the once haughty
little Ryan masterpiece save the engine, and
other metal parts.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the big idea, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk asked this as a leader, wishing to get a
better grip on his own nerves, since they had
been dreadfully shocked at the dire result of his
random shot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Going to circle around a few times, and drop
down a bit,” came the illuminating reply;
“though I reckon it’s no use, since nothing could
live in all that awful blast.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe not, Jack,” remarked Perk, a bit
cheerily; “but there’s a fair chance neither o’
them guys got snagged in the flash o’ that gas.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Perk, have you some foundation
for saying that?” demanded the other, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure—they jumped all right, boss,” Perk
told him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You saw them do it then, did you, boy?”
continued Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They bailed out okay—I saw two take the
jump right after the first flash came—went down
like plummets in the bargain—smart lads those
guys are, I’m tellin’ you, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>No doubt Jack was glad to hear this bit of
news, for it had filled him with horror to realize
that in order to escape they had been compelled
to ruthlessly take human life. He was
much younger than Perk, veteran of the World
War, who had grown more or less hardened
to such happenings when staking his own life
against that of a tricky German air pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Still goin’ down, are you?” asked Perk shortly
afterwards, on finding that they were still
swinging around in a wide circle, that burning
pyre far below being the hub of the wheel of
which their boat was the outer tire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Might as well,” came the ready answer,
showing that Jack had made up his mind
hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess now they’ll get down somehow, boss;
a whole lot depends on what kind o’ landin’
they’ll be able to make—if its rocks, or trees,
they got to strike it’s apt to be some hard sleddin’
for the boys. Say, ’taint possible now you’re
fixin’ to try an’ lend ’em a helpin’ hand? I’d
hate to know they’d been wiped off the map in
that hot fire; but somehow I don’t feel like
playin’ the part o’ the Good Samaritan to such
man devils as them two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No danger of my trying to make a landing
where the chances are ten to one it just <i>can’t</i> be
done,” explained Jack, seeing that his companion
was almost ready to mutiny if any such mad
proceeding were contemplated. “I’d just feel
better if I knew they’d reached ground okay;
then we could keep on our way, and it’d be up
to them to get out of the scrape.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! I get you, partner,” grunted the relieved
Perk. “Don’t think I’m bitter about the
thing, ’cause they’re sure hot stuff all right; but
I’m a bit slow to accept that forgive and forget
stuff, specially after any guy’s tried his level
best to gimme a dirty deal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll try the thing out while on the job,”
Jack announced. “Our own wonderful escape
from meeting just that same kind of fate makes
me kind of soft. Perhaps we’ll not be able to
learn a single thing; you know how it often is
when you’ve finally struck ground after quitting
the ship by the chute route—all out of breath—sometimes
knocked up a bit, if you escape broken
bones—not any shape to shout, or do anything
but just lie there, and suck in the air in big
gasps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, that’s right for you, old hoss,” Perk
readily agreed. “Me, I once got a collar bone
smashed that way. No harm in our makin’ a
few swings around these diggin’s ’fore we put
out for Orleans. That fire keeps burnin’ like
things they got sprinkled right well with the
juice when the tank blew up. Go to it, Jack,
just as you please, never mindin’ a few squeals
from a hard-boiled guy like Perk Perkiser.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m going to shut down on the engine, and
take a little glide, so we can pick up anything
like a yell,” announced the pilot a minute later.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to it—duck then, boy!” snapped Perk,
as he temporarily relieved himself of his ear-phones
in order to catch anything bordering on
a shout from the ground below.</p>

<p class='c013'>The simple expedient was carried out successfully,
and when once again they leveled out,
to continue circling, Jack asked eagerly:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get anything, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a bleat, partner,” replied the other, who
had hurriedly held his earphones in position so
as to cover the emergency.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sorry for that, but we’ll try a couple more
times before calling it all off,” suggested Jack,
who could be more or less persistent when the
occasion arose for such action, though never
carrying it so far as to be reckless.</p>

<p class='c013'>So a dozen seconds or so afterwards he again
gave warning that it was time for another drop
of a few hundred feet—not that they meant to
take any chances by getting too close to the unknown
terrain lying in the pitch blackness under
the flying ship; but simply to be able to listen
with the horrid clamor of the bustling engine
momentarily stilled.</p>

<p class='c013'>No better success followed this second maneuvre—all
was deathly silent around, above,
below, as though never a solitary living human
being existed within miles of the spot where
the destruction of the Ryan monoplane had
taken place.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll give a third and last try,” was Jack’s
announced decision, to which Perk added:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Three times, and batter’s out—by then I rather
guess we’ll be down close enough to the solid
ground to make another drop dangerous. Either
way I’m satisfied we’ve done the right thing,
old hoss. Suit yourself when you see fit to
coast,” whereupon he once more denuded his
ears of the exceedingly useful and really indispensable
phone harness, to await the occasion
of the last try in the line of an aviator’s
duty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it, Perk?—get a whisper?”</p>

<p class='c013'>They had completed the glide, and were once
more on a level course, with Jack even turning
the nose of the ship a bit heavenward; since
neither of them knew what the nature of the
ground below must be—whether some hill lay
directly ahead, against which they might smash
for a complete wipeout.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! a heap more’n that, partner!” came
the triumphant reply. “Heard a shout, an’ then
another some distance off—struck me both
jumpers had lit okay, and were tryin’ to communicate,
so’s to get together again. Guess
things ain’t so bad after all with them guys, an’
we c’n be movin’ on our way without botherin’
any more ’bout their safety. Some two-legged
varmints seem to be watched over by Old Satan
hisself, they bein’ that venomous, and evil-minded.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack made no rejoinder to this remark, tinged
with bitterness as it was, only pointed the nose
of his craft upward, and started to spiral for
altitude. Undoubtedly he was feeling greatly
relieved because of their having escaped so
miraculously from the hovering peril; and best
of all managed to turn the tables on those who
would have encompassed their destruction just
in order to defend the lawless game in which
they were engaged in connection with Slippery
Slim.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk must have been doing a little hard thinking
as the time passed and they raced on their
way, for later on he started to speak; and as
usual his line of chatter told that he was seeking
information, trying to find a solution of
certain exasperating puzzles that were “twisting
his intellects,” as he himself described
matters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Things kind o’ got me goofy, partner, an’
I’d like you to raise the curtain some, if so be
you feel so bent. First place I guess it goes
without questionin’ that these huskies must be
in cohunks with that there big gun, Slippery
Slim Garrabrant?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! that’s a dead certainty—who else would
have any reason for waylaying us in Atlanta,
and setting up this trap for us to fall into?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! then it stands to reason, boss, he’s
got means for findin’ out what the Secret Service
aims to do; an’ so has been able to play the boys
for suckers every time they set out to lay him
by the heels, eh, Jack, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s past history, Perk; even the Big Boss
got wise to it, and tried everything possible to
learn where the great leak happened; but our
experience proves they haven’t discovered it so
far. I’m making up my mind that the closer
we draw to the headquarters of this rotten clique
of crime, where they make the bogus long-green
that’s been flooding the whole West for a year
and more, why, the harder our job is bound
to be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which tickles me a heap, boy—I’m just
yearnin’ for comin’ to grips with that gazaboo
o’ a Slim; and now we’re on to the job I’ll never
be happy ’till he’s on his way to that big Government
pen we glimpsed in Atlanta, where
some other lads we helped to pinch are doin’
time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if you keep on as you’ve started, Perk,
we’ll flatten the whole gang like pancakes—they’ve
stacked up against a new sort of revenue
dog when they started a shooter of your calibre
on the trail. First you smashed their searchlight,
and then sent a chuck of lead into the
gas tank that broke up the game. That’s the
kind of a pinch hitter you are, partner; and
right now I want to congratulate you on such
dandy marksmanship.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lay off that stuff, Jack—nothin’ but great
luck fetched the bacon home for this lad. But
me, I’m shakin’ hands with myself ’cause I
had that hunch a bear gun mightn’t be such a
bad thing to tote along on a trip that’s goin’ to
carry us across the border, an’ into Old Mex,
like as not; where the greasers are sometimes
tough nuts an’ hard to handle they tell me.
’Spose we’ll run across them two hill billies
again, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wouldn’t surprise me a bit if we did,” replied
the pilot, leveling off at a three thousand
foot ceiling, and still heading due southwest.
“Like as not they’ve got plenty of ready cash
along; and after having been so cleverly upset in
their calculations, due to your beating them silly
with a barrage of hot lead, they’ll be hot to wipe
out their disgrace. Oh! yes, we’re going to run
up against that foxey pair again before the book
is closed for keeps.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c014'>CHAPTER VII <br /> <br />STRIKING THE FOG BELT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>With the stars shining brightly above them,
and a moon just past its full climbing the eastern
heavens, having dissipated the darkness of the
earlier part of the night, Jack and his fellow
voyager continued plunging along in a very
satisfactory fashion, having no reason for feeling
further concern regarding the peril to
which they had been so lately subjected.</p>

<p class='c013'>But things were not destined to continue so
comfortably for the two adventurers, it seemed.
Perk was just congratulating himself for about
the fourth time at having such a comfortable
flight, when he sat up and took notice of the
fact that those heavenly bodies were beginning
to look exceedingly hazy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Danged shame, that’s what, to spoil such a
dandy night!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What ails you now?” demanded Jack, on
hearing the other make this little remark that
bespoke exasperation at least; “another boat on
our tail?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I guess not just now,” replied Perk,
scoffingly; “one was more’n enough for a single
jump. But we’re agoin’ to run into a pesky
fog belt, sure as you’re born, old hoss!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That all?” laughed the other, who apparently
saw nothing of particular consequence
about such a common happening; “it may perhaps
manage to slow us down more or less; but
what does that matter, when we’ve got time to
burn. The Big Boss told us, remember, not to
hurry things at all—plenty of time, oodles of
money, and any backing we chose to call for in
the way of a new boat, or more helpers. We
should worry, old scout!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Tain’t that in peticular Jack,” complained
the other; “but of all things a sky detective’s got
to run smack up against, fog’s the one I despise
most. It’s got me in bad more’n a few times, so
I’ve grown to look on the peasoup stuff like it
was my—er, what-dye-call it—Nebraska, no, I
mean Nemesis.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, now you mention it, Perk, I remember
you telling me something about that strange feeling
you have creep over you. No need for you
to apologize—in my knocking around among airmen
I’ve found that often even the most daring
and reckless in the bunch had some kind of a
weakness, if only you looked far enough under
the surface; just as sometimes you’ll find a boasting
bully actually afraid of his little wife at
home, who’s smacked him with her handy rolling
pin many a time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! wasn’t I a canvas man ’long with a
travelin’ circus a wheen o’ years ago, an’ didn’t
I see the biggest elephant in captivity rear up
on his hind legs, lift his trunk sky-high in the
air, an’ squeal like fun just when a little half
grown mouse happened to run along near his
alley. Well, I’m the tusker, an’ fog is the
mouse, as you might say—we never do get on
well as a combine. Hope it hugs the ground,
an’ leaves us a clear track up among the clouds
I c’n see creepin’ up ahead yonder.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Doesn’t bother me a whit, partner; don’t
forget we’ve got that new radio beacon aboard
to try out; and if it’s as clever as I’ve heard tell
it’ll carry us along our route to Orleans through
the thickest nest of fog anybody ever stacked up
against. Naturally we can’t expect to get the
full benefit of its capacity to hold a speeding
plane on its true course; because the invention’s
hardly more than half baked up to now; but I
set it according to directions, and if at any time
we begin to slide off our course the light that
springs up is bound to give warning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A bully good layout I’d say, if it c’n do what
they claim,” ventured Perk, who undoubtedly
had read certain things concerning the new invention,
and was eager to learn just how it would
pan out. “You showed a level head, partner,
when you decided to take the offer o’ that gent
in Atlanta, and try the thing out. Guess, then,
I needn’t bother my head ’bout gettin’ astray;
if things keep bein’ invented it ain’t goin’ to be
very long till a pilot’ll get slapped good an’
hard if he misses runnin’ on a straight line, or
even veers from his proper course in a great big
blow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re living in a machine age, Perk, and
every day things are heading that way on the
run—electric helps in kitchen, factory, and even
aboard our air cruisers. While the brainwork
and strain grow harder the actual manual labor
is lessened all the time. But as you say it’s getting
a bit hazy, and chances are we’re in for a
spell of blue fog.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Ten minutes afterwards there could not be
the least doubt concerning that fact, for by degrees
even the stars vanished from view, ditto
the gorgeous round moon. Still, since the sky
remained brighter in the east, it was not at all
difficult to tell where the fair mistress of the
Southern night had hidden her face behind the
opaque veil.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was now flying by instruments alone,
since never a thing could be seen by the keenest
eye above, below—they seemed to be hung in
unlimited space; but pushing along with considerable
speed just the same, bound for the distant
city on the vast Mississippi, situated not so
very far from its delta.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus passed a full hour.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly Perk saw a small light spring into
view on one side of the plane, and it certainly
electrified him considerably.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hi! there, partner, we’re off our track—shifted
to the east, seems like, unless I’m away
wrong in sizin’ things up ’cordin’ to Hoyle.
Got to swing her to the larboard-watch side, I
kinder guess—how ’bout that, boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You hit it that time, Perk, and here she goes
to climb back to our true course. Worked just
as we figured it would, and put us wise to a fact
we’d hardly have picked up in any other way.
I reckon now this same radio beacon’s bound to
turn out a great help to the poor badgered air
pilot, flying blind when fog hides the ground
beacons, and he gets no aid from the heavens
above.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll say it’s the best thing I’ve struck for a
long time,” affirmed the delighted Perk.
“There she goes—the glim I mean—closed shop,
havin’ ’complished the business set for her;
showing we must have struck our real course
again.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Easy money,” laughed Jack, just as well satisfied.
“Makes a fellow sit up and try to guess
what the next big idea connected with aviation
will prove to be; doesn’t seem to be any limit to
the dazzling discoveries these scientific chaps’ll
turn out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, partner—like that big chute they’re
trying out, which they claim will keep any
plane from crashing—if the engine goes dead
all you got to do is to press a little button, and
when the drop comes open goes the monster umbrella,
able to hold you and the crate suspended
in the air, to gradually fall to the earth like the
colored balls from a bursted skyrocket. Great
stunt that, an’ I’m livin’ in hopes it’ll be my
luck to some day find myself aboard a ship that’s
equipped with such a giant chute, an’ have the
glorious experience of seeing the thing work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack seemed to consider it the part of wisdom
to pull up more or less, as they were in no hurry,
and could drop down on the aviation field at
New Orleans by dawn, even though they concluded
to just “loaf along.” Disliking anything
pertaining to fog Perk naturally said nothing
to hint at a desire for further speed; besides
his own good sense told him that what his mate
had just said with regard to no necessity existing
for haste, was sound logic, and a due regard
for “safety first.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So the time slipped away, with midnight finding
them past the meridian of their projected
flight. Perk had long since subsided and
seemed content to sit there in the double cockpit,
letting his thoughts roam back to the exciting
developments of the earlier night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Years had elapsed since last he watched a
doomed plane writhing and twisting in its death
agonies, with the flames wrapping it in an envelope—a
blazing coffin speeding headlong to a
final crash; and here, strange to say, after all
that time intervening he had again passed
through a similar experience. Now that he had
an opportunity to calmly review the happening,
Perk admitted he was pleased to know the two
occupants of the Ryan cockpit had apparently
escaped a miserable fate that must have been
laid at his door.</p>

<p class='c013'>Two A. M. and all’s well!</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk figured that when a few more times
sixty minutes had passed it would be time for
them to catch a first glimpse of the great rolling
turgid stream that could, when the heavy rains
united with the melting snows up in the mountains
of the Far West, create vast floods that
placed much of the low country along the river
under many feet of water. It had been a long
time since last Perk had set eyes on the Mississippi,
and hence he was considerably worked
up over the prospect of soon glimpsing the
mighty flood.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c014'>CHAPTER VIII <br /> <br />NEW ORLEANS—FIRST STOP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“There she rolls, Jack, old boy—the greatest
stream in the whole U.S.A.—I swan if she
don’t look just as fine as when I glimpsed her
for the first time many years ago!”</p>

<p class='c013'>That was Perk’s tribute on beholding the
Lower Mississippi perhaps thirty miles above
New Orleans; he displayed almost as much enthusiasm
as those early discoverers did centuries
back, when their distended eyes took in the
mighty sweep of the flood rolling down toward
its junction with the Mexican Gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was early dawn, and the fog bank had been
dissipated by a fresh breeze acting as advance
courier to the rising of the sun. Jack, looking
toward the southwest could also see the object
of his companion’s exultation, and undoubtedly
felt some of the same pleasure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When it gets a bit lighter we’ll have a far distant
view of the city, with its smoke cloud hovering
over it,” he remarked, knowing that soft coal
and southern pine as used for fuel in the Fall
and Winter seasons always caused something of
a pall to mark the site of the river metropolis.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk reached around, and drew forth a case
that on being opened disclosed a pair of pretty
decent binoculars, with which they had been
fitted out by the Washington authorities before
starting on this particular man-hunt, with an
idea that they might prove most useful sooner
or later.</p>

<p class='c013'>After clapping these to his eyes Perk announced
that he could easily pick up the goal
of their flight from Candler Field; although the
smoke did act as a screen, through which it was
not possible to see with certainty.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was now bringing out all the reserve
speed of their ship—it was of some consequence
that they make a landing as early as possible,
since he had no desire to attract undue attention,
and possibly have inquisitive newspaper reporters
to be asking pertinent questions as to
whence they came, what their identities might
be when at home, and also concerning the object
of their coming to New Orleans. Secrecy
was the foundation on which they meant to
build their plans; and from their previous experience
with those dare devils in the employ of
Slippery Slim, too much care could not be employed
in order to mask their batteries.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, too, as they approached the city Jack was
dropping down to lower levels; while on his part
Perk skimmed the whole scene, looking for the
airport they knew to be somewhere within reach
of their vision.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being presently located he called his
chum’s attention to the open field, and in almost
no time they were circling it, looking for the
best place to land.</p>

<p class='c013'>Early though it was there were moving figures
circulating around, while some sort of ship
was coming in from over the river—possibly one
of the air mail carriers from a distant station, it
might be many hundred miles away, fetching
Uncle Sam’s important letter sacks, and worthwhile
express matter, at treble the speed that the
fastest train could muster.</p>

<p class='c013'>The landing was effected without the slightest
difficulty, and hardly had their boat come
to a stop than a number of persons, most of them
connected with the ground force of mechanicians
and hostlers, surrounded the incoming
craft, paying but scant attention to the air mail,
which dropped down almost at the same moment—that
was a daily happening, a following
out of a regular schedule, to which they had
become accustomed; while the arrival of a mysterious
plane might stand for almost anything.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold fast, Perk!” said Jack, as he took off
his headphones, and raising his voice to almost
a shout, so deaf did he appear after a whole
night’s run; “don’t tumble out yet; and keep a
muffler on your gab, for we’ve got to let ’em
take it out in guessing. I’ll soon see if the
party we’re expecting to meet is on hand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He still kept his helmet and goggles in position
as he thrust his head out of the cockpit, and
raising his right hand with two fingers extended,
made a species of salute. A stout man,
with a very red face, and an air of importance,
immediately pushed through the gathering
crowd, and answered Jack’s signal with a similar
sweep of his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s okay, Perk—that’s our party, and he’s
been watching for us, showing he had my wire
last evening. Get a move on, and we’ll soon be
doubling our legs under a breakfast table.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! but that will be a joy to me,
old hoss!” Perk exclaimed; “’cause I’m as
hungry as a wolf, an’ the smell o’ coffee is apt
to set me wild. Go to it, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was paying no attention to these vaporings,
since it was a common occurrence to have
old Perk declare the bottom of his stomach was
in danger of falling out—he had met the red-faced
gentleman and they were shaking hands
as they exchanged a few words.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all fixed, comrade,” he said to Perk over
his shoulder, mentioning no names lest suspicious
ears catch them, and thus have a clue as
to their identity; “we’ll get a few of these boys
to run our boat into a hangar close by, which is
waiting for us, and then cut out for the city—and grub.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This being speedily carried out, with the
doors fastened securely, and the two flyers began
to hastily divest themselves of their working
“duds.” Before ten minutes had passed
they were on their way in a taxi the gentleman
friend had brought out, with Jack and their
host talking at a great rate; while as for Perk
he was looking out, and finding more or less enjoyment
in seeing new and novel sights along
the road.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk having been well coached as to the
necessity for caution, made it a practice to snatch
an occasional glance in their rear, looking for
any signs to indicate that their car was being
trailed; but nothing at all suspicious came to
his attention.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meantime Jack had learned that their new
friend (whose name he already knew to be Mr.
Adkins) was connected with the Administration
forces of the United States District Attorney,
having offices in the Government building—that
he had been secretly advised of their coming
days before receiving Jack’s wire; and was
ready to give them all the information possible
concerning what had been learned in connection
with the wholesale operations of the man they
had been sent out to cage, so as to effectually
remove the greatest menace that had threatened
business men of the Southwest in a decade.</p>

<p class='c013'>In due time he would post them regarding
all these important facts; meanwhile they
could take things easy, for there was no hurry,
and the game was of too much importance to
allow lax methods. When they got good and
ready they could make a start, and after that
everything must depend on their ability to beat
Slippery Slim at his favorite game of “dog eat
dog.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He steered his guests to a certain restaurant
where he knew they could be well taken care
of, and which turned out to be close to the hotel
at which they booked under fictitious names.
Here Perk was given the privilege of ordering
just what he desired along the line of rashers of
bacon and fried eggs; cornbread with syrup;
several cups of coffee taken black; and to top off
with, a Havana cigar such as he was not accustomed
to smoking, being addicted to the more
friendly pipe habit.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no talk of shop while they partook
of breakfast; such business as they had to transact
was of too delicate a nature to be discussed
in a public place, where strangers would be
coming and going, and spying eyes might be on
them every minute of the time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Later they gathered in the room at the hotel
where, behind closed and locked doors they felt
free to confer in lowered tones.</p>

<p class='c013'>Much had to be told, and numerous thrilling
accounts brought out connected with adventures
experienced by other Secret Service men in their
efforts to round up the notorious gang—all of
which had resulted in absolute defeat for the
Government agents.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shrewd men some of these parties undoubtedly
were, with a record of numerous famous
cases successfully carried through; but somehow
when they found themselves up against
Slippery Slim Garrabrant they sooner or later
fell down on the job, and had to be recalled.</p>

<p class='c013'>In fact, it was disclosed to Jack and his pal,
two different agents were never again heard
from, after secret code messages had been received
from them to the effect that they were
even then getting very close to a great discovery
that must end in the arrest of the malefactor—a
dead silence that had never been broken
seemed to signify that they must have fallen into
some sort of fiendish trap, possibly meeting with
a gruesome fate that would be forever shrouded
in blank mystery.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins, watching closely as he narrated
these uncomfortable facts, was pleased to see
that neither of his interested auditors displayed
the least sign of being disturbed, showing that
they had long since discounted everything along
this line.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c014'>CHAPTER IX <br /> <br />COACHING PERK</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Of course it was in keeping with this exchange
of confidences that Jack should relate all that
had happened to them since their arrival in
Atlanta to secure the ship awaiting them, load
it to capacity for a long voyage, and finally start
off from Candler Field.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins listened eagerly to this modest
account of what had already happened to them
as a starter in the hunt they had undertaken;
and he was visibly thrilled at hearing of the
bitter night chase, the desperate tactics undertaken
by the pair of human wolves aboard the
Ryan monoplane; and particularly when Jack
finally described in vivid language the astounding
act of Perk in first shattering the bothersome
searchlight, to follow this with his lucky
random shot that bore into the gas tank of the
pursuing craft and brought about an explosion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Possibly the urbane gentleman had never in
all his life listened to so ghastly a true story as
the graphic one thus modestly related by one
of the two participants; looking at them, with
Jack so calm and modest, giving all the credit
to his grinning accomplice, he must have decided
in his astute mind that at last Slippery
Slim was going to have a pair of human bloodhounds
on his trail such as all his ingenuity and
vindictiveness combined could not throw into
the discard.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me have,” he went on to say to Jack, “as
good a description as possible of those same
bills your friend Scotty found in that pocketbook
dropped among his clothing by the unknown
party whom you believe was looking for
your letter of instructions from Washington.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When Jack complied with this request the
other nodded his head approvingly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question but what they were of the same
stripe as all the others that have been brought to
our attention,” he told Jack. “You must know
it’s been a mooted question as to whether the
plates from which these notes are being printed
in vast quantities (that make it a gold mine for
the gang) are counterfeits engraved by some
master in the art or stolen property, which have
somehow never been missed by the plant where
much of the printing is done for the Treasury
Department—the bills are so perfect that cashiers
and tellers are all at sea over the facts, so
that something of a near panic has resulted in
banking circles as a result of this unknown quantity.
Remember these are the old type of banknotes,
and not the new abbreviated form of currency,
so that it is more difficult to discover the
actual facts.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will all come out in the wash, sir,” remarked
Perk, sagaciously, with a sly wink at
his pal.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, Perk,” observed the gentlemanly official,
smilingly; “but I’m more concerned about
your plan of campaign than anything else right
now. During the time you stop over here in
Orleans I mean to keep you posted with regard
to any fresh news that comes in to Headquarters
for there is hardly a day when we do not learn
of additional discoveries connected with this deluge
of phony money that’s been dumped on the
whole Southwest by this hard working gang.
I am telling you everything that’s known or suspected,
so that you can figure out your best line
of action.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We understand that, Mr. Adkins,” said Jack,
nodding, “and you can rest assured we appreciate
your kindness more than I can tell you.
Before we jump off you will know what we’ve
decided to do, so as to pick up a warm trail;
and after that, sir, don’t be worried if you fail
to hear a single word from us for days, weeks,
or even months; but depend upon it we’ll be
working on the job every minute.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And never forget, I beg of you, that this
man is a devil for cruelty and craftiness—I’m
sure you’ll not delude yourselves that his arrest
will be an easy task; for as good men as were
ever on the roll of our Secret Service Department
have fallen down on the job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you again, sir, for your warning; but
we’re not meaning to feel anything like over-confidence,
so as to let the bars down. I understand
from my having been picked to take up
this case, that the knowledge of myself and my
assistant here along the line of aviation cut a big
figure in the appointment, since it has been
learned that Slim himself makes use of a flying
boat possibly to cross over from the wilds of
Mexico, it being suspected he has his plant
hidden away somewhere among the mountains,
where he doubtless keeps peace with the authorities
by paying tribute that insures his being left
undisturbed. We hope to change all that sooner
or later, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I admire your modesty, Jack,” continued the
Government official, who had warmed toward
the pair during the short time he had known
them, and seemed to take a personal interest in
their fortunes. “Remember to keep in touch
with Headquarters while in the city, so as to
notify me in case you need any assistance—I can
later on place a posse of oldtime Texas Rangers
at your service, if the occasion arises for a necessity
to show force—they are now working for
the Government as border patrols, and as you
can understand, are the same rough-riding, fearless
type that played such a leading figure in
the early history of the Lone Star State; for we
have authority that covers such matters. And
I’ll be one of the first to extend you my hearty
congratulations should you win out, and bring
in your man; as I’ve no doubt your good pal
here used to do when, as you’ve told me, he used
to work with the Canadian Mounted Police
force, in years gone by.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It won’t be our fault, sir, if we make a flop
o’ the job,” asserted Perk, who believed he ought
to get in an occasional word; although there
were a good many things he did not wholly
understand, and which he would depend on
Jack to further explain when opportunity arose.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins shook them both cordially by the
hand, and took his departure, leaving them to
digest all the startling facts he had placed in
their possession. By slow degrees they would
figure things out, and sketch their plan of operation;
then would come the hour when once more
they must depend on their wings to carry them
many hundreds of miles toward the scene of
action, where the air would be surcharged with
dynamite, while deadly enemies might be lying
in ambush, ready to take them by surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk started to spring his questions, and Jack
was only too glad to make the necessary explanations;
for it was necessary that they work in
complete harmony if they hoped to be successful.</p>

<p class='c013'>As far as they had gone, things looked hopeful
to Jack, as he marshalled the facts that had
lately been placed in their possession. He was
satisfied that when every item had been arranged
in its rightful sequence they could fashion a
plan of campaign that would at least have a
better chance for winning out than any of those
utilized by former detectives, who had not possessed
the essential wings so as to meet Slippery
Slim on his own chosen ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No tellin’ just how long we’ll stick it out in
this burgh, I guess, buddy?” suggested Perk,
some time later, as they continued to take things
easy, resting up after a hard night’s flight, and
meaning to get around the city after noon and
lunch time had come and passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Couldn’t say as yet, Perk; we’ve got to comb
out the stuff as handed over by our new friend,
Mr. Adkins, and discard everything that doesn’t
pan out as being worth while. Then there were
a few leaders he dropped that, if followed up,
might turn out to be leading clues, the possession
of which would possibly turn the tide of battle.
I’m meaning not to let anything make me show
undue speed—Rome wasn’t built in a day, we’ve
got to recollect, and so shape things from the
standpoint of ‘safety first’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! that’s the boy!” gurgled the pleased
Perk; “me, don’t I remember that story o’ the
hare an’ the tortoise runnin’ a race, which the
turtle won ’cause he never even stopped to rest
up; while the rabbit, thinkin’ he could run loops
around such a plodder, lay down to take a nap,
overslept himself, and when he got to the goal
there was Old Leatherback awaitin’ to turn the
big laugh on him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk wound up with one of his rollicking
laughs; everything seemed to create merriment
in his soul just now, after that royal breakfast;
though perhaps he was running away ahead of
the dry facts, and counting his chickens before
they were hatched out of the shell. But Perk
was confident the sly fox of a Slim would find
himself snagged in the net one of these days,
and the clever guy who handled things would
turn out to be an aviator and sky detective named
Jack Ralston.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack some time afterwards, had just aroused
from a short nap, when Perk, who had been
pondering and grumbling to himself, tossed out
another question, as if to disclose what was
troubling him:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it, old hoss, do you b’lieve them
dicks we left behind after they’d floated down
from a high ceilin’ with their chutes, got outen
the scrape, so they could a hiked to some nearby
village or town, an’ took the first train headed
for Orleans, reckonin’ we must a’been on the
jump thisaways?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say the chances all point that way, Perk,”
Jack told him, without the slightest hesitation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jumpin’ crickets! if that’s a fact why, a feller
might run acrost the slick pair any old minute—meet
’em right face to face!” Perk went on to
say, as if the fact gave him more or less concern.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose then you’d recognize the chappies
with just one look, eh, what about that, partner?”
asked Jack, laughingly; at which the other
grinned a bit foolishly, to admit he had serious
doubts on that score.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! didn’t either o’ us get a peep-in at
their monikers, worse luck—had them helmets
and goggles in place right away, like they didn’t
mean to give us a single look-in. S’pose now
they got the high sign on us boys?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“On a venture I’d say that was always possible,”
replied Jack, soberly; for this very point
had occurred to him, and was as yet unsettled
in his mind. “Nobody knows how long they may
have been in Atlanta—Mr. Adkins assured us
Slim seemed to have all sorts of strings out, so
as to learn in advance of any bunch of Government
agents taking the field against his giant
bogus money monopoly; and for all we can tell
those two may have been spying on us most
of the time we were around Candler Field, getting
our ship ready to take to the air.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rotten luck, I’m sayin’, and too much one-sided
to suit me,” growled Perk, frowning savagely.
“Here we got to do our work in the
dark; while that smart cuss holds all the high
cards in the pack, an’ c’n trump our ace any
time he takes a notion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No need to worry about that, comrade,” said
Jack, soothingly. “You must remember that
when we move along we mean to disappear as
if heading into the thickest belt of pea soup fog
ever seen—in that way they’ll lose all trace of
us, and we can play our cards as we choose, making
up for a different breed of sky travelers, so
as to dope the cleverest kind of spies he can send
out. While they’re left guessing what’s become
of us we’ll be doing our little tracking job, and
hour by hour, day after day, keep on creeping
closer to their secret stronghold, wherever that
may prove to be. Those are some of the things
we figured on doing, Perk, don’t forget.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The one addressed made no reply, but as he
let his head fall back, as if he meant to pick up
a few winks of sleep, there came a look of rapt
admiration on his weather-beaten face that bespoke
the utmost confidence in his best pal.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c014'>CHAPTER X <br /> <br />LAYING PLANS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>After a noonday lunch Jack and his partner
spent most of the afternoon in carrying out the
various duties that were seemingly on their program.
Among other things Jack visited the
Federal building, and was closeted for more
than an hour with Mr. Adkins.</p>

<p class='c013'>The latter official had conceived a great fancy
for young Ralston, and went to no end of trouble
so as to post him with regard to what he was
likely to run up against while endeavoring to
close in on Slippery Slim. With his accustomed
sagacity Jack made notes of some of the
facts thus laid before him; but since these were
in shorthand, and would be utterly unintelligible
to any outside party, should they chance
to fall into enemy hands, there was no danger
that any mischief would follow.</p>

<p class='c013'>By degrees he was filling up with scraps of
description, and everything connected with
former attempts at locating the hideout, where
all this unlawful scrip was being turned off the
press, to flood the Southwest.</p>

<p class='c013'>That was always his way of doing—when
given a tough job Jack would live alongside it,
breathing the very atmosphere of the undertaking,
until he found himself sympathetic with the
aims and ambitions of the criminals whose apprehension
was placed on his shoulders by his
Big Boss.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll have dinner early, Perk,” he told the
other, who had been carrying out a number of
special duties while Jack was busy elsewhere,
“so as to retire to our room at the hotel. No
going out after nightfall for us just at present,
especially in a strange city, where some sneak
might waylay us coming back from the theater.
All that sort of pleasure must be put out of our
heads just at present.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! guess you’re hittin’ the nail on the
head, old hoss, when you say that,” grunted
Perk, who very probably had already picked out
just the screen play he wanted so badly to see;
but he was a good scout, and able to put duty
above pleasure, when the occasion arose for
making a personal sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another thing,” continued Jack, “there’s no
telling what night flying we’re bound to be up
against, in trying to keep our movements secret;
so it’d be wise for us both to enjoy all the extra
sleep that comes our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, partner,” assented Perk, subordinating
his desires to the slogan which he knew
was Jack’s watchword—“safety first”. “When
I’ve stowed away all the grub I c’n hold mebbe
I’ll be ready to hit the hay, to stick it out till
cock-crow around daylight—an’ then some.
Pretty fair sleeper, they always called me across
the big pond—crawl out as the last horn was
blowin’, rub my eyes a bit, get aboard my fightin’
crate, an’ step off to knock another Heine pilot
down afore botherin’ ’bout my breakfast—all in a
day’s doings with Gabe Perkiser. Sabbe that,
partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I know you like a book,” Jack told him
with a smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get a bellyfull when you had that confab
with Mr. Adkins?” demanded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m filled up to the brim with all kinds of
material, which by degrees I’ll have to sort out,
keeping only what strikes me as essential,” came
the answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see—sorter separatin’ the chaff from the
wheat,” mused Perk; “an’ if it’s a fair question,
old hoss, which way do we head when we take
off?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You might call it due northeast,” Jack told
him; and then, as his companion uttered a
startled exclamation, as though vastly surprised,
Jack gave a quick glance around as if to make
certain that no one was dogging their footsteps,
after which he lowered his voice almost to a
whisper, to add: “but that would be only for a
<i>blind</i>, in case hostile eyes were watching our
departure from the flying field; for after we’ve
cleared a dozen or more miles we can make a
complete circle, and point the nose of our boat
squarely west!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good boy!” snapped the relieved Perk;
“sounds a heap more like it. You sure did
throw a big scare into me, Jack, ’cause it’d been
’bout settled ’tween us that the game had ought
to be played out there in the boundless waste
spaces around the border.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, everything points that way so far,” he
was assured; “but no more talkie at present,
Perk—we’ll keep bottled up until inside four
walls, where no spy can steal our thunder.
Slim’s knocked the underpinning away from a
bunch of fine schemes looking to his undoing,
simply by finding out what the big game happened
to be, and then bursting the bubble by a
scoop. We don’t intend to dish our business
that way if it can be helped.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wall,” drawled Perk, with his best Yankee
effect, “guess not if we know our stuff, an’ c’n
roll our hoop.”</p>

<p class='c013'>As they walked along toward their hotel Perk
kept up a constant lookout, as though endeavoring
to make some more or less thrilling discovery—never
a man, black or white, did they meet
but that he was made the object of a severe
scrutiny by the suspicious one; however, they
reached their objective without his having run
across any reason for making a decision; and
shortly afterwards they were securely lodged in
their room, the door locked, and a couple of easy
chairs inviting them to take things comfortable,
which they lost no time in doing, being wearied
from so much trotting about—flying men as a
rule not enjoying a reputation for pedestrian
feats.</p>

<p class='c013'>A long and serious confab followed, both
speaking in low tones; Jack on his part explained
the mass of information he had accumulated,
and answered the flood of questions asked
by his comrade, as well as he was able; until he
found a chance to go deeper into things himself
he could not make definite statements concerning
a number of points that were a bit hazy, and
needed confirmation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus the afternoon waned, and the time came
when they were ready to think of the essential
“eats”. Of course it was Perk who brought this
subject up, for he chanced to have a tremendous
appetite, and was apt to give considerable time
to figuring what his next <i>menu</i> would be—indeed,
half the enjoyment in his estimation lay in
thus building air castles along the line of “grub”.</p>

<p class='c013'>Remembering that little episode up in Atlanta,
where some unknown party had made such
a “rat’s nest” of Scotty’s adjoining room, evidently
under a mistaken belief it belonged to
himself and Perk, Jack made sure to carry all
his important papers on his person, properly secured,
so that no deft hand of a sneak thief could
negotiate their abstraction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All ready, partner,” he told Perk, at the time
looking out of the window, holding back the
curtains to see the better who chanced to be
walking along the opposite pavement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never said sweeter words than them, old
boy; I sure was close to faintin’, my tummy
feelin’ like the bottom was adroppin’ out—soup
an’ such soft stuffs, while fillin’ at the time don’t
stay with me any great while—I crave solids
mostly. On your way then, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had marshalled all the facts that had
been placed in his possession, weeded a few out
as worthless, and by the time their discussion
ended had told his companion that the Finger
of Destiny was pointing out their future course
as lying over the almost boundless plains of
Texas, across New Mexico, and deep into Arizona
deserts, to the wild country along the border
not far distant from the spot at which the
Gila river forms a junction with the larger Colorado;
where the latter serves as a watery boundary
line between Arizona and Southeastern California,
with Old Mexico less than thirty miles
distant as the crow flies.</p>

<p class='c013'>It would be a big jump for them, but the flood
of bad currency undoubtedly had its start somewhere
in this hostile region, and spread out like
an open fan, northwest into San Diego and Los
Angeles—northward up to Salt Lake City—and
in the northeast as far as Oklahoma. To
effectually break it up it was necessary that they
go to the fountain head, so as to destroy the very
roots of the noisome poison ivy plant.</p>

<p class='c013'>They spent more than half an hour dining,
and needless to say Perk enjoyed himself to his
heart’s content—who wouldn’t if he had a pocketfull
of ready cash, furnished by a bountiful
Uncle Sam; a bill of fare bristling with all kinds
of tempting dishes such as Perk doted on; and
to complete the combination having been born
with a healthy, unbridled appetite?</p>

<p class='c013'>It was just commencing to get dusk when they
emerged from the restaurant and started back to
the hotel, some two blocks distant. Perk, as
usual, kept turning his head this way and that
very much like a wolf scalp-hunter looking for
his suspicious quarry. Presently he picked at
Jack’s sleeve, and bending his head until his lips
almost touched the other’s ear he observed in a
sibilant whisper!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen, partner—we got a clam doggin’ us
like a bloodhound on the track o’ a runaway nigger
from a convict camp back in Alabam—get
that, do you?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c014'>CHAPTER XI <br /> <br />THE NIGHT ALARM</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“I’m not thrilled by what you say, Perk, because
I’ve been more than half expecting to hear
that discovery. Glad you got on to him okay;
because it’s always best to know what’s in the
wind. What sort of a chap is he like?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack spoke in his usual calm way, and the other
realized he had undoubtedly been prepared for
the sudden news.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ out o’ the way ’bout his looks, far as
I c’n see,” was Perk’s reply; “on’y got a few
squints at the guy; but he’s keepin’ tab o’ our
movements I guess now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Reckon he might be one of those lads in the
Ryan ship that crashed in flames after they’d
flown the coop?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! just can’t be dead sure, partner,”
chuckled Perk; “but there’s somethin’ ’bout his
walk that gets me into believin’ he’s the <i>kiwi</i>
that pilot was keepin’ on our tail so long, stickin’
like a leech from a mud-hole.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder,” the other went on to say, as if
talking to himself; “if that’s the case then, both
those duffers pulled through with their lives, and
not so badly hurt. Honestly I’m a bit glad that’s
so, for up to the present I’ve never had occasion
to take a human life.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk snorted on hearing this.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if so be you’d been ten years older, my
boy, mebbe you’d not be able to say that—chances
are you’d a been mixed up in that mess across the
Atlantic, when Yanks an’ Johnny Rebs were
fightin’ shoulder to shoulder, and it was a case o’
a Heine pilot’s life or our’n. But if you keep
on with Uncle Sam’s service as you’re adoin’
right now, the time’ll come for you to fetch back
a dead man who jest <i>wouldn’t</i> let hisself be captured.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like as not,” remarked Jack; “but there’s no
need of crossing a river till you come to it; so
I’m not taking trouble by the forelock away
ahead of time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’ll we do ’bout this dickey bird that’s
bobbin’ at our heels so gaily, tell me, partner?”
pursued Perk, eagerly, as though in his fighting
heart he was actually hoping his superior would
give the order to turn on their persistent pursuer,
and at least blacken both his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! nothing at all, Perk; let him run his
rope; only we’ll keep along streets where there’s
plenty of company, and be prepared for any sort
of ambush; though I can’t believe he’d be crazy
enough to start anything so early in the evening—if
the hour was close to midnight, things
might be different. There are any number of
tough cases in this old Creole city ready to handle
a sticking game for the coin in it—blacks and
yellows and whites it doesn’t matter which—all
of them are assassins at heart.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then you don’t care if he shadows us straight
to the hotel?” demanded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Much good that will do him.” said Jack with
a light laugh; “the chances are two to one he
already knows where we’ve put up, and has had
some spy dog me to the Federal building. When
the time comes for us to jump off we’ll find a
slick way to hop our ship without giving these
boys a show-down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently they arrived at the hotel entrance,
without any untoward incident arising to mar
the quiet of the evening. Perk cast a parting
glance toward their rear just before entering,
and seeing the shadowy figure hovering not far
away, considered it a part of his duty to place
his thumb to his nose, and wiggle his fingers
derisively, at the same time uttering a snarl like
a bobcat at bay, to express his utter contempt.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once in their room, Jack first of all cast about
as if to decide whether any uninvited guest had
intruded on their preserves while they were absent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything seems to be just as we left it,”
he told his running mate, after making this little
survey, “and even if some busybody did get in
here with the aid of a pass-key borrowed from a
chambermaid, he was shrewd enough not to mess
things up like they did with our friend Scotty
of the air mail bunch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess now they must acome to the conclusion
you keep the letter o’ instructions ’bout your
person,” suggested Perk, wisely, “which, bein’
the case mebbe now they figger on sneakin’ in
here while we’re sound asleep, an’ agoin’ through
your clothes in regulation style. They do tell me
there be sneak thieves right clever in this same
burgh, equal to the ones out in India, where they
c’n steal the sheet from under a sleeper, without
wakin’ him up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I understand that’s really true, partner,” Jack
agreed; “but we’re not going to let them have
half a chance, even if they hired all the crooks
in New Orleans to play the game.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sounds good to me, boss,” Perk declared.
“We’ll manage to sleep with one eye open, an’
if any critter tries to give us the once over, he’ll
wish he’d never been born, that’s all I know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Before turning in, Jack placed a chair so nicely
balanced that in case of the door being ever so
slightly opened it would crash to the floor, making
enough noise to arouse the Seven Sleepers.
Perk grinned at seeing him prepare this “guardian
angel” as he termed it, and lost no time himself
in “hitting the hay.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Some time later in the night, when outside
noises had almost died away, there came a loud
clatter that awoke both the sleepers instantly.
They bounced out on the floor in their pajamas,
with Jack pulling the cord he had attached to
the electric bulb, so that the room was magically
illuminated.</p>

<p class='c013'>The chair lay on its side, and just beyond Perk
could see that their door was partly open; the
key had been left in the lock, but skillful fingers
must have manipulated it by means of
slender-jawed pliers, showing the touch of a professional
thief.</p>

<p class='c013'>Straight toward the door the form of Perk was
projected—a hungry lion could hardly have
made a more pronounced leap at some four-legged
game which he had been stalking.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tearing open the door still wider, Perk thrust
out his head, and looked up and down the hotel
corridor. He fancied he could make out a dim
figure far along the poorly lighted hall, but it
vanished like a phantom even as he stared, evidently
turning some corner.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there were other sounds arising—doors
all along the corridor were opening, and heads
being projected, showing how the startling alarm
had awakened numerous other sleepers, who
may have imagined an earthquake was in process
of occurring, though such a happening was utterly
foreign to the metropolis on the Lower Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c013'>Voices, too, were heard, from both masculine
as well as feminine sources, as the aroused hotel
guests endeavored to fathom the real meaning
of the row.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, seeing there was nothing doing, closed
the door, and locked it again; after which he
turned to his companion who had been watching
his actions with more or less amusement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Consarn his picture,” growled the old fighter;
“he got off scot free; I jest glimpsed him
aturnin’ the first bend down the hall. Blamed
shame I couldn’t come to grips with the yeller
cub—I’d a given a heap to twist his neck
some, you bet I would. Mebbe now I’d otter sit
up the rest o’ the night to make certain, eh,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not the slightest need of such a thing, partner,”
Jack assured him. “I’ll fix that door so it
won’t be opened again in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c013'>With that he again took the stout chair, and
placed it diagonally against the door, so that its
top rested just under the knob; after that had
been accomplished it must needs be a battering-ram
that could burst in on them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not content with that, Jack went to each of
the two windows, thrust out his head to examine
for the second time the face of the outer wall of
the building so as to make sure there was no
ledge wide enough to give a would-be trespasser
foothold.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not the ghost of a chance for the most nimble
thief to get in by way of a window, Perk, so
back to bed we go, and sleep like babes in the
wood for we’re in the third story and far enough
from a fire escape to be secure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk grinned and nodded acquiescence; truth
to tell he was not at all averse to starting all over
again—possibly the rude interruption had disturbed
him just when he was starting to partake
of a royal feast that covered every one of his most
beloved dishes and he was hugging the delusion
to his heart that if given another chance history
might repeat itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>At least there was no further alarm, and the
night passed into oblivion like all its countless
predecessors with the rising sun arousing the
two comrades, and Perk as usual singing out
that he felt as though he could easily manage two
customary breakfasts in that delighful restaurant
where they were already feeling so much at
home.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c014'>CHAPTER XII <br /> <br />PLAYING WITH FIRE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>During the morning Jack took a taxi and paid
another visit to the offices in the government
building where Mr. Adkins had his desk, doing
his daily stunt under the direction of the U. S.
District Attorney and other officials in the service
of Uncle Sam.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, also, had his job laid out for him, which
was to circulate around until he felt positive he
had thrown off any possible spy after which it
was his duty to make certain purchases, following
the list Jack had given him, have them all
sent to the aviation field in charge of the man
Mr. Adkins had placed on guard at the hangar
containing their ship and thus completing the
stock of supplies necessary for their long flight
and survey work.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk carried out his instructions to the letter,
and with great vim, since the fact of their laying
in these stores was a positive indication that
things were coming to pass insuring a speedy
getaway and <i>Action</i> was what had come to be
the greatest asset in life to Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>They met again at noon in their eating place,
where, choosing an isolated corner table they
could discuss their plan of campaign, even while
attending to the wants of the inner man.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk made his report, which the other seemed
to find good, judging from his frequent nods of
acquiescence and when the story had been told
to the last word, Perk felt it was his turn to
learn things.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess now you got the last batch o’ information
from His Nibs, Jack?” he hastened to
ask, expectantly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sure did, partner,” he was told. “A few
scraps of fresh news that’d be likely to interest
us had drifted in since I saw Mr. Adkins last,
which he passed along to me. I’ll sort these
shreds over later, and fix them where they belong.
So far as I can see now they corroborate
what we’ve already been so strongly believing
must be a fact.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which means, I guess, boss, we head west?”
ventured Perk, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Into the setting sun—that’s right, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do we still expect to keep in touch with Mr.
Adkins, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whenever the chance opens up, and we have
any important news to send along or want to
know certain things, perhaps even to call on him
for that bunch of old-time Texas Rangers he
said he could turn over to us if we found any
use for them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be!” said Perk, plainly excited, “I
sure do hope that emergency does bob up, ’cause
I’d give my last Mex dollar to glimpse them
rearin’, tearin’ ole fighters knockin’ spots outen
the bunch o ’lawless ringers Slippery Slim’s
gathered around him. Chances are they’d skip
out like hot fleas soon as they heard the ol’time
battle cry o’ the defenders o’ the Rio Grande in
the days when cattle rustlers raided the ranches
down Texas way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But we’ve got to remember,” cautioned
Jack, “that these chaps are like lean hungry
wolves, that never leave the trail of a wounded
stag as long as they can crawl along. I’m not
fancying we’ve pulled the wool over their eyes
so far and that fact was brought to my attention
just after I got back from conferring with
Mr. Adkins.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As how, boss?” queried the curious Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t just know what influenced me after
I’d entered the hotel, to step back and look out
again,” explained Jack. “There was the driver
of my taxi, the trusty who’d been recommended
by the clerk at the desk, talking earnestly with
an unknown party and even as I watched I saw
him thrust a bank note into the chauffeur’s itching
hand, showing that he has been corrupted
and is in cohoot with our enemies.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! is it so rotten bad as all that, partner?”
bleated the disgusted Perk, “All I c’n
say is I sure do hope it was a nice brand new five-dollar
bill he handed over to the yeller dog, an’
that it’s agoin’ to turn out to be a sample o’ their
bogus money outfit. Serve the slick renegade if
he got hisself pulled in for passin’ a counterfeit
note on some guy that ain’t goin’ to sit by and
take what’s comin’ to him without raisin’ a nice
howl.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t be too vindictive, Perk,” Jack told
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, partner, ever see the boob afore?” the
other demanded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you mean the chap who was pumping my
driver for all that was out, Perk, I can’t say
that I have. He was a flashily dressed man,
with loud clothes that would stamp him as a
gambler, like those who used to travel on these
Mississippi River steamboats in the old days before
the Civil War, fleecing unsuspecting passengers
out of all their money and I haven’t
the least doubt but what he’s a member of the
very gang we’re expecting to round up. Mr.
Adkins told me it was simply amazing the vastness
of the combine Slippery Slim’s managed to
gather around him but he was certain it must
number many scores of workers, all obeying the
orders of the mainspring—crooked Slim Garrabrant.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! the more you keep on tellin’ me them
big stories, Jack, the happier it all makes me
’cause I seem to just know there’s bound to be a
heap o’ rough house stuff croppin’ up, to cool
my blood, ragin’ hot just now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some fine day you’ll be rubbing up against
enough fighting to make you call quits with the
game. Perk, my boy; and it’s just likely to crop
up before long if indications count for anything.
I felt pretty sure from his swagger that
this fellow might be the very same master mind
in charge of that Ryan boat—then, too, when he
walked away he had a little limp, which might
have come from striking the ground so hard
after his chute let him down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Darned pity he didn’t break a leg, or even
his measly ol’ neck, I’d say,” grumbled Perk, one
of his fits of resentment gripping him just then.
“Got no use for these treacherous snakes that
squirm, and worm their way into the confidence
o’ honest gents, on’y to play a low-down trick,
an’ fill their pockets with smackers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s one thing we’ve got to guard
against,” suggested Jack, who seemed to have a
faculty for looking at every side of a picture,
and anticipating troubles that might never have
occurred to others less gifted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As what, partner?” asked Perk, brightening
up once more.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Delay is what they may be hoping for—some
way to hold us here while important news is
carried to headquarters. I can even see how
they might make some sort of ridiculous charge
against us to the police, in hopes we would be
held several days under suspicion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk looked astonished.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But see here, boss, we got our credentials
from Washington to prove we’re in the Secret
Service, an’ sky detectives at that; they jest
wouldn’t dare hold us on some sorter flimsy
charge ’cause that’d get ’em in hard with the
Government, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never know how these affairs may turn
out,” said Jack. “Often there seems to be some
kind of a jealous feeling between States officers
and those of the Government—almost like a little
vendetta, each arm of the Law striking out
at the other, and getting in a sly lick that’s good
for a laugh after hostilities have died down.
These Southern city police might make out
there was a grave charge of abduction or something
like that, compelling them to hold us <i>incommunicado</i>—that
is keep us from intercourse
with the U. S. District Attorney’s office until
several days had elapsed and then setting us
free with a lot of apologies that didn’t mean anything
whatsoever.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! I get your drift partner,” said Perk,
frowning. “We sure can’t afford to spend any
of our valuable time in the hoosgow here, if we
c’n help it. ’Cause things set that way I hope
you get busy an’ fix it so we’ll shake the dust o’
this same burgh off our shoes in a hurry. Got
the date settled yet, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shook hands with, and said goodbye to Mr.
Adkins this morning, Perk and you are at
liberty to figure that out as you please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it’s <i>tonight</i>?” asked the other, looking
well satisfied with such an enticing programme.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wind and weather permitting we’ll clear out
soon after twilight settles down on the city and
the river,” Jack assured his understudy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me, I’m sittin’ pretty, an’ taking things as
they come along, old hoss,” continued Perk.
“Let’s perambulate and attend to the crying
needs of this high noon hour—the girl told me
they expected to have apple dumplings for lunch
today an’ that’s one I’d nominate as bein’ among
my prime favorites—you know I got a <i>few</i> I
really enjoy an’ that’s no lie either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I know a good many on your list—fact
is,” said frank Jack, “if I ran down the whole
menu this noon there’d be only a scant few that’s
missed being called your especial favorites each
in its turn as the wind blew. But just as well
we did all the eating while the chance lasts, for
only a magician can tell what our bill of fare is
going to be during the coming week or two—some
weird dishes most likely—boiled owl,
fried rattlesnake, baked prairie dog—Heaven
knows to what ends we may be reduced.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have a heart, partner, don’t take my healthy
appetite away by mentionin’ them terrible
dishes. ’Member you promised we’d hire a taxi
after lunch, an’ drive all around the city, lampin’
the big sights like the French market, the queer
buryin’ places where holes in thick walls take
the place o’ graves, on ’count o’ there bein’ so
much water in the ground, with the city settin’
so low down, an’ the ol’ Mississippi on one o’
its benders. Then I want to eat Gulf oysters
an’ shrimp at one o’ them cute little stands we
noticed yesterday afternoon; try a reg’lar Creole
dinner tonight at that place Mr. Adkins told us
about—after which I’m all done with Orleans,
an’ ready to pull up stakes for keeps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll keep that to the last, Perk, and go to
the flying field from the eating house by taxi.
From that time on we’ll have to depend on our
own heads and hands to keep us out of difficulties.
But let’s hope we can climb up to a three
thousand foot ceiling, and strike out as if we
were aiming for Savannah or Jacksonville, only
to swing around inside of half an hour, climb
high over the city and river and put for the
Texas border at full speed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This enchanting program gave Perk much
cause for rejoicing and he sat down at their regular
table in the restaurant feeling, as he expressed
it, “happy as a clam at high tide” and
full of little laughs that seemed to gurgle up
from his shoes.</p>

<p class='c013'>They chatted of other happenings, not wishing
to “talk shop” in such a crowded place, lest
listening ears pick up certain information that
could be used greatly to their disadvantage—Perk
had an endless fund of interesting reminiscences
that, told in his inimitable fashion,
were a never failing source of joy to the appreciative
air pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was spent in motoring all
around the most interesting portions of the city,
the obliging Mr. Adkins having made out a list
of subjects they should not miss seeing while on
this first visit to the justly famous Louisiana metropolis.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIII <br /> <br />THE HOP-OFF</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Leaving the hotel, after settling their account,
and still making use of the taxi with its accommodating
driver, Jack and his comrade had
taken what small amount of hand luggage they
possessed along with them, not meaning to come
back again.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins had recommended a small but
unique restaurant run by a buxom French madame,
where they could have a Creole supper,
such as would long haunt their memories as a
genuine treat and it was to this place they ordered
their driver to convey them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both of them felt fairly convinced they had
been shadowed during the afternoon, although
so carefully must this have been accomplished
they had no positive proof to make it what Perk
would term a “dead certainty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They really did have a delightful “feed,” and
the dishes set before them were as a rule complete
mysteries although the obliging madame,
seeing they were tasting her triumphs of the
French <i>chef’s</i> art for the first time, gladly explained
the nature of the food they consumed
with so much gusto.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was fascinated with his supper, and inwardly
vowed that this should not be the last time
he would partake of tasty Creole dishes. This
duty fulfilled, they faced the next progressive
step in their night’s program—making for
the aviation field, and boarding their ship for
a speedy takeoff, their ultimate goal neither of
them could say just where, save that if all went
well they expected to be somewhere along the
California border within the next few days.</p>

<p class='c013'>The taxi was waiting, with the chauffeur on
the alert. He had already been advised of the
fact that they anticipated having some parties
attempt to spy upon them as evening settled
down and on this account he had maintained a
strict watch for troublesome visitors who might
even attempt to threaten him with bodily injury
unless he agreed to enter into their plans for
delaying the flight of the two flyers, as he knew
his passengers to be from what he had been told.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I see our taxi’s still on deck, partner,”
observed Perk, just as if he might have suspected
they would find it missing, with a detail of grim
city police waiting to escort them to the lockup,
they to be held in durance vile until serious
charges against them could be sifted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing came along to bother you, Henri?”
asked Jack of the smiling driver, who laughed
as he said in reply:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I haf seen one beeg hulk of ze man hanging
around, M’sieu, and looking as if he would like
to eat me up but me, I haf been an old soldier
in the Grand Army of France, and I think he did
not like the way I throw my chest out thees way,
and walk as eef I am on guard duty; he did not
address a single word to me, but just a little
while ago he disappear—I think he may haf
gone to get more courage out of ze glass.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good boy, Henri,” said the grinning Perk,
clapping a hand on the stalwart chauffeur’s
shoulder; “for myself I should not like to tackle
you when you have your fighting face all set.
Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So they were off, and heading out in the direction
of the aviation grounds, with the first shadows
of approaching evening gathering around
them. Perk may have been more or less nervous,
in anticipation of something coming to pass that
would seriously cripple their plans for a speedy
flight, since he kept turning his head from side
to side and scrutinizing every one they saw upon
the streets they traversed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Henri maintained a fairly good speed, all the
law would permit, so that few cars passed them
on the road. Perk managed to watch closely,
and never a motor came booming along in their
wake, honking to announce the driver’s intention
to pass by, than he had his eyes glued on the car
and continued to pay strict attention until it
had crept well up ahead.</p>

<p class='c013'>But after all nothing out of the way came to
pass, and eventually they reached the aviation
field where they found lights already in play,
since a delayed air mail ship was hovering over
signaling for better illumination. There was
some small damage in regard to the steering
gear, making it a bit risky to try a landing unless
the field was brilliantly lighted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You made an arrangement with a couple of
the ground force to hang around so as to help
us get the crate out okay, didn’t you, Perk?”
queried Jack, as they drew up close to the particular
hangar where they had seen their plane
placed in quarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, I sure did, Jack,” the other replied.
“Must be they’re over where that crate hanging
overhead means to land—somethin’ wrong mebbe
but they gimme their word to stay around
till we got here—there, I c’n lamp the guys
runnin’ thisaways right now, so it’s okay, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I see them coming,” returned the other,
himself a bit relieved, since the intended departure
was a most important episode in their plans,
and to meet with any sort of a setback would
be most aggravating indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The two mechanicians quickly arrived, the
hanger was unlocked and opened so as to permit
the exit of the ship. First of all both flyers
hastened to don their working togs, then fasten
on the ’chutes with the harness necessary for the
purpose, all working smoothly and finally clapping
their helmets on their heads, with the earflaps
secured to keep things in readiness for any
emergency that might crop up.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being accomplished, Jack gave the word
to have the heavy ship dragged out into the open.
He knew that his assistant would have looked
after everything essential to their comfort during
the coming flight for Perk was one of those
dependable fellows who carry out orders with
machine-like regularity.</p>

<p class='c013'>A few parties had hastened up to see what
was going on but so far as Perk could tell they
were either workers connected with the field, or
else visitors from the city, who had lingered to
watch the landing of the air mail, so as to tell
how it was done when they reached their several
homes, to partake of a late supper.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now the ship had been swung around so as
to head into the west, since the soft evening breeze
was coming from that quarter and everything
seemed in readiness for the take-off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, still surveying his surroundings as if
still cherishing a fragment of his former suspicions
that all might not be as lovely as surface
indications would announce, started to climb
aboard. Jack on his part was handing some
money to the two men, not wishing to leave a
single thing unpaid when passing out from New
Orleans—there was nothing to be done about
their use of the hangar, since Mr. Adkins had
assured him that matter had already been taken
care of, regardless of how long they chose to
linger in the Crescent City.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, too, cast a last glance around, just as he
would have done had he still been with the air
mail service and about to start off on his customary
night flight with the north-bound sacks
of letters and the express matter that vent along.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then he heard Perk give vent to a hurried
exclamation:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get aboard, partner; I guess the measly critters
are acomin’ down on us like hot cakes right
now. Lookit how they start arunnin’ thisaway,
will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did not bother looking, as every second
might be valuable; he climbed aboard with alacrity,
and settled down in his seat; at the same time
calling out to the helpers to stand aside. Then
he pulled the gun, with the motor responding
instantly, so well had Perk done his work when
checking up the ship that morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was still glueing his eyes on the several
figures now racing madly in their general direction,
and waving their arms wildly; no doubt
they had started to shout in addition, but the
descending air mail crate was making more or
less racket, which, added to by their own motor’s
thunder, prevented any one from hearing what
they may have been whooping.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was trembling with an excess of emotion—evidently
they had just escaped “by the
skin of their teeth,” for he felt certain he could
distinguish the uniforms of the police in the
little bunch of runners.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Played your hand just a mite too late, gents!”
Perk was whooping as he in turn waved a mocking
adieu backward; “thought you’d ketch a
weasel asleep, I guess, but not so easy, you gate
crashers. Wow! here we go spinnin’ along like
the wind, and it’s goodnight to the bunch. Huh!
shootin’ at us, air you—jest awastin’ ammunition,
that’s all, boys. Go ’way back an’ sit down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Jack lifted her in an upward fling, and
they were off like a startled hawk!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIV <br /> <br />SKIRTING THE GULF</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There was some shooting going on back there,
for although of course the watchful Perk failed
to catch the sound of discharges of guns, he did
see flash after flash, proclaiming that the police,
under the impression that important criminals
were beating them to it, wished to show
their warlike spirit by such a bombardment.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the flying missiles came anywhere near the
ascending plane that fact was not manifest to the
two occupants of the cockpit; their movements
must have been too speedy for such an attack to
be successful and almost immediately they had
risen beyond the danger line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was feeling vastly relieved, for it would
have been a bad beginning of their special mission
were they detained for days in the Southern
city, while the agents of the great counterfeit
league held the upper hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>He could see with the last glimpse he had of
the aviation field that all this lively accompaniment
to their take-off had created considerable
excitement—people were running back and
forth, like milling cattle when stampeded in a
furious thunder storm and Perk even fancied
there was some sort of a movement as though a
ship would be sent after them in pursuit.</p>

<p class='c013'>That troubled him not a bit, because already
they were leaving the field far in their wake, and
would really be lost in the gathering shadows of
coming night before any pursuit plane left the
ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides, had they not already had one experience
along those lines, and completely worsted
the persistent enemy, sending their boat down in
spirals of flames, with the two occupants forced
to “bail out” in order to save their lives?</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk put that possibility completely out of
his mind and busied himself with more practical
affairs. First of all he was desirous of communicating
with his comrade and to do this
they must have those indispensible head-phones
clapped to their ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was already applying his own pair with a
confidence inspired by frequent applications,
after which he managed to get Jack equipped
with the other pair.</p>

<p class='c013'>Steadily they continued to ascend, and swing
around until they faced the east, following the
plan Jack had outlined to his mate. Not too
high did the pilot urge his craft, since such a
course was apt to bring them in the sunlight
that still lingered along the upper air lanes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, they turned out to be a hot bunch all
right, partner,” was what Perk observed, when
he had the harness adjusted and the ear-phone
means of communication in shape for use.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You reckon they must have fetched the police
out with them, do you, Perk?” demanded the
one at the stick, as he kept an eye on his dials
spread across the black dashboard in front of the
cockpit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! just what they did, old hoss,” returned
the other, vehemently, but accompanying his remark
with a loud chuckle that told of secret
amusement, he being excessively fond of anything
that smacked of a joke; “an’ they kept up
a runnin’ fire at us, let me tell you—could see the
flashes spittin’ like fire crackers on the Fourth
o’ July.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All of which sounds like they must have told
a pretty wild and woolly yarn to the cops, to
make them want us as bad as that, eh, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Makes me think they got an idea this ain’t
goin’ to be just a ordinary man-hunt, but something
worth while; we should worry, Jack.
Mebbe they a’ready see the handwritin’ on the
wall, an’ mean to try an’ upset us in the start,
’fore we get agoin’ full tilt. Notice you’ve gone
an’ headed east, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It may fool them; but whether it does or not,
Perk, such a move’s our proper caper. When
we’ve gone something like ten or fifteen miles
we’ll get on the curve, swing around to the south,
and then when in sight of the gulf turn due west;
after that we’ll be on our way to the place where
our work is waiting for us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! had an idea you’d just climb till out
o’ sight, an’ then cross over the city and river—how
’bout it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too much risk to begin with,” came the ready
reply, showing how Jack always planned ahead;
“you know how a rushing boat can be heard
clearly even when lost to sight among the clouds.
It might be those same smart chaps, backed by
the authority of the police, would commandeer
a ship, and cruise around over the city, so as to
learn if we <i>did</i> come back so as to line out into
the heart of Texas; to make sure such a giveaway
of our plans can’t upset our calculations
we’ll cross the delta of the Mississippi close to
where it joins its muddy waters with the gulf.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you now, partner, an’ let me say I guess
that’s the safest game we c’n play. Time don’t
count anything wuth while with us on this trip
but results are what we crave.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it that time, boy, the Big Boss has
confidence in our being able to fetch home the
bacon, and we’re bound to prove he didn’t make
any mistake in putting us on the job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>All this time they continued to zoom along
like a frightened wild duck, and it was not long
before Jack was turning the nose of his ship
toward the south. The night had not as yet
settled down over the earth, although they were
holding an altitude of several thousand feet and
by straining his eyes a bit Perk was able to distinguish
objects far below—he could tell when
they passed over a large sheet of water, probably
Lake Ponchartrain, with narrower cuts winding
through vast marshes, and seas of waving reeds;
also begin to catch fugitive glimpses of the still
distant Mexican Gulf stretching away to the
mysterious south.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was all deeply interesting to Perk, always
on the lookout for fresh and novel scenes; for as
it happened, thus far in all his wanderings he
had really never looked upon that historical sheet
of salt water; although reading many a rattling
romance of the days when buccaneers and pirates
haunted the sub-tropical waters of that same
gulf, lying in wait for the Spanish galleons laden
with gold bars taken from the prodigally rich
mines of Mexico and Central America.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Perk’s mind those historical personages,
like Blackbeard, and his fellow rovers of the
Black Flag, lent a glamour to the great body of
water that was apt to thrill him through and
through whenever he allowed his gaze to fall
upon its restless surface, and dark secrets of the
past ages.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards their course was again
altered, with the ship swinging into the west. It
would seem to have been something like extreme
caution on Jack’s part but from all accounts, as
well as from their own experience with the desperate
gang that had given Uncle Sam so much
trouble, the scoundrels had a tremendous game
at stage, and were ready to go to any lengths to
protect the profitable conspiracy from being
smashed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Safety before speed” had always been Jack’s
slogan, which could be accounted one of the leading
reasons for the success that had come to him
in the various vocations he had followed—as a
county fair barn-stormer, then in the regular air
mail service, and now finally with the celebrated
Secret Service arm of the Government, entrusted
with one of the most abnormal duties ever given
out to its members.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not too dark for Perk to know when they
were passing over the several outlets to the
mighty river; indeed, he was even able to distinguish
an ocean going steamship heading up
toward the city of New Orleans; for its lights
were plainly in evidence and those who chanced
to be on deck could probably catch the throb of
their motor, since the air was unusually still,
allowing sounds to be heard at great distances,
especially when in the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then finally they left the water behind, and
found themselves passing over great stretches of
sugarcane, and bamboo thickets, with cabins of
the humble blacks in little hamlets, sometimes
villages of the lowlands, where, as Perk plainly
recollected, recent terrible floods had wrought
such damage.</p>

<p class='c013'>So the night wore on, and thus far nothing
had occurred to cause them the slightest worry.
If their cunning enemies suspected them of
planning to go west, and baiting the chief in his
lair, there was nothing as yet to show that they
were making arrangements to intercept the air
adventurers on their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>An hour—two of them passed, and still they
kept making rapid progress. The moon was long
above the eastern horizon, although occasionally
obscured by passing clouds but Perk told himself
it was a pretty fair night, all things considered,
and that he had “no kick coming.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c014'>CHAPTER XV <br /> <br />PERK AS A FIRE-FIGHTER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was not far from midnight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had insisted on taking over the controls,
so that Jack might secure a little rest, possibly
even pick up a few catnaps in addition. They
were at a low altitude, perhaps not more than a
thousand feet up, since the air was a bit cool
higher and it was certain they stood in no
danger from colliding with mountain peaks
while crossing the wide State of Texas, where
nothing save the level plains lay beneath.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was alive to his duties, but this did not
keep him from occasionally stretching his neck,
so as to look over the coaming of the cockpit,
and trying to make out objects that might be
dimly detected on the seemingly limitless plain
below.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a rule next to nothing worth while rewarded
these efforts and really he continued
doing his little stunt from sheer habit, but there
did come a time when he showed sudden interest,
and even half arose from his seat to stare
with increasing intensity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not only that but he immediately banked, to
start circling around a certain point. A minute
afterwards Perk reached out and shook Jack
gently by the shoulder. The ear-phones being
still affixed to their heads, Jack naturally desired
to know what was up, and did his pal wish to
give over the stick to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ doing, partner,” he was told with
emphasis; “but there’s somethin’ queer goin’ on
down yonder, and I’ve swung around so’s to give
it the once over. On your right, Jack, an’ there,
see how it sparks up again, will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say it looks like a fire,” ventured Jack,
after taking a good look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My idea to a fraction, boss!” snapped the
deeply interested Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like it might be breaking out through
the roof of some sort of cabin, or ranch house,”
further suggested Jack, himself now almost as
excited as his running mate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, boy!” declared Perk; “but somehow
I don’t lamp anybody kickin’ around in a
big fuss, ’cause o’ the shack bein’ ablaze; strikes
me either nobody ain’t to home or else they’re
so sound asleep they don’t know what’s goin’ on.
Glory be! if that’s the case, partner, they stand
a mighty good chance o’ bein’ burnt to death in
their beds. What ought we do ’bout it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“First place we’ve just got to rouse ’em up,
and the way to do that is to rush our engine to the
limit, so’s to make a big row—if that doesn’t
wake anybody it’ll only mean they’re away from
home—or else already smothered by the smoke.”
Perk accordingly started up such a racket that
the dreadful roaring noise seemed hoarse enough
to awaken the dead and all the while he kept
swinging around in a continuous circle.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, bending over the side, watched to see if
this had any effect, nor was his discovery long
delayed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That fetched them, Perk—I can see several
moving figures, and they seem to be rushing about
with pails in their hands. If the fire hasn’t got
too strong a start they may be able to throw
enough water to put it out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, couldn’t we do somethin’ more to help
the poor dicks?” cried Perk, ever ready and
willing to assist anybody in trouble, no matter
at what cost or personal risk to himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It mightn’t be a safe thing to attempt a blind
landing,” he was told; but something in Jack’s
voice or manner when he said this encouraged
Perk to go a bit further.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, chances are it’s as level as a barn floor
down there,” he hastened to say, eagerly; “here,
you could take the stick—there never was a better
hand at makin’ a three-point landin’ than
you, partner; me, I might drop a few flares down,
an’ that’d give us a squint o’ the ground. If we
kept to leeward o’ the fire there wouldn’t be any
risk from sparks, don’t you see, Jack? I never
yet had such a fat chance to be a fire-fighter;
let’s go, boy—they need all the help they c’n
get, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The temptation was so great it soon overpowered
Jack’s sense of caution; really he fancied
he would never forgive himself if he allowed
Perk to show a higher sense of duty to people
in distress than he himself could display.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, you win, Perk!” he quickly called
out; “hand over the stick, and get those flares
ready to drop when I give the word.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk started to make a move, showing that he
knew just where the objects of his desire were
located, for he did not have to leave his seat in
order to place his hand upon the small package
of flares.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile Jack had reduced their speed to
a minimum compatible with safety, still continuing
that circular movement. The fire had
by this time assumed sufficient proportions to
dispel any doubts they may have entertained regarding
its true nature, for it was burning at a
lively rate. Jack could see a crouching figure
sprawled on the roof, and apparently emptying
bucket after bucket of water on the greedy flames,
and passing the empties back down the nearby
ladder to some one standing on an upper rung.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was all mighty exciting, and to Jack seemed
like some sort of fetching picture as shown on
the silver screen at the movies—a scene developed
through the skill of a wizard director, aided
by a group of star actors, so as to bring out all
the realistic effects.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get ready, Perk!” he told the other suddenly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All set, partner,” came the inspiring response.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let her go, then!” called out the pilot, just
as he found himself over a point to leeward of the
burning ranch house that he figured would be
the best place to make a landing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had a flare falling almost as the last
words left the lips of the pilot and then both
of them used their eyes to advantage as it neared
the ground, lighting up a small section fairly
well—at least what he thus saw seemed to convince
Jack it would be fairly safe to attempt a
landing, for the ground looked smooth, and free
from outbuildings, corrals, or wire fences.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Drop another, quick as you can!” directed
Jack; then, as this was carried out he started
down, showing the die was cast, come what
would.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk threw a third flare to one side, in the
hope that its light would afford his pilot a chance
to effect one of his really marvelous landings;
which turned out to be sound reasoning on his
part—the shock when their landing gear came in
contact with the ground was not very severe, and
Jack managed so that they did not run more than
thirty feet toward the burning house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus far all was well.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was out of the cockpit like a flash, but
managed to hold his eager spirit in check long
enough to allow his comrade to join him. Then
they hurried over to the building, which they
could now see, thanks to both the moonlight and
the brilliance of the blaze, must be some kind of
a ranch house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Several men who had the appearance of cow
punchers were working for all they were worth,
fetching water from a well, and hurling it where
it was calculated to do the most good.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s give you a hand in that game, neighbors!”
Jack burst out with, as he joined the string,
backed by Perk, and commenced handling
buckets full and buckets empty, with as much
vim as though tested and tried members of a
village fire company.</p>

<p class='c013'>At such a time the addition of two more
willing workers can do considerable toward
smothering a fire, especially when there happens
to be no wind moving; and from the moment of
their arrival things began to take on a better
look as though up to then the fight had been
hovering “on the fence,” as Perk called it, and
the balance being overturned, victory was in
sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was in his glory, and the brisk way in
which he hurried those buckets along was worth
going a long way to witness; Jack never would
forget how proud he felt over the marvelous performance
of his running mate, and how those
encouraging cries, so constantly emitted by Perk,
seemed to enthuse everybody with fresh vim and
go.</p>

<p class='c013'>Finally the last spark was extinguished, and
the house saved, having suffered but scant damage.
Then the men, yes, and women too, gathered
around the pair of aviators who had come
on the scene just in the nick of time, to first of
all arouse the people of the prairie ranch to a
sense of the danger that hovered over their heads,
and finally take chances in effecting what might
have been a rough landing, so as to lend their
material aid to the fire fighters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Surely you will not think of starting off again
till break of day,” the big man with the white
head of hair, evidently the rancher himself, was
saying, while engaged in pumping the hands of
the two who had dropped down from the sky,
as it were, to bring warning of the burning roof,
and start the stiff fight against the greedy flames
that had ended so successfully. “Stay and eat
breakfast with us, strangers; we’d like to know
you both some better, and have a chance to thank
you most heartily.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unfortunately we must be on our way, neighbor,”
Jack told him. “It happens we are on
special duty, and delay might upset certain plans
we are bent on following out. It was just by
sheer accident we discovered the fire, and took
the customary means for attracting attention that
all air pilots employ; but some other day, if we
chance to be in this neighborhood, we’d be
pleased to see more of you all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The women added their voices to the pressing
invitation, but Jack was forced to decline, although
doing so smilingly, since he would have
liked very much to see more of these warm-hearted
stockmen and their wild riders, possibly
picking up some useful knowledge concerning
the way a ranch is run in these modern days, so
different from early times in the cattle country.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is absolutely necessary for us to be going,”
Jack told them all, “if we are lucky enough to
be able to hop-off again. Perk, I wish you’d
take a look over toward the west, and see if the
ground is fairly clear; while I talk for a few
more minutes with our new friends here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was astute enough to avoid giving their
names to any one but the ranchman, who readily
promised not to mention them to a living soul;
he felt heavily indebted to Jack and his chum,
and considered that they knew their business
best—for one thing he felt absolutely certain the
fact of their being in such a hurry had nothing
whatever to do with any unlawful act on their
part—he had as much confidence in them as
though Jack had actually confided the fact of
their being Government Secret Service agents,
bound on a mission fraught with much peril to
life and limb, the prime object of which was to
save honest people from being victimized by a
gang of unprincipled sharks, makers of clever
bank notes that were without the pale of the
law and only base counterfeits, although clever
imitations of the genuine bills.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVI <br /> <br />IN THE GRIP OF THE STORM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Perk soon afterwards showed up, and seemed
so cheerful that it was evident his little scouting
mission had yielded favorable results.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems okay to me, partner!” he burst out
with, as soon as she came along; “course it ain’t
just as smooth as some fields we know but there
ain’t goin’ to be any smart trouble takin’ off, I
guess now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And are we holding the nose of the ship
straight in line of the course you took a squint
at, Perk?” Jack asked, as he prepared to climb
into his seat, the people of the ranch clustering
around, to gaze with wide open eyes at the fleet
aircraft, some of them doubtless seeing such a
modern cloud clipper for the first time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dead ahead, boss, an’ you’ll strike the right
racket, I’m tellin’ you,” came the positive assurance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then jump aboard, comrade, and we’ll put
it to the test,” saying which Jack himself climbed
into the waiting cockpit, to settle down in his
accustomed seat, take a quick glance at his dials
when the small light was turned on, and await
a signal from the other sky traveler that he was
“fixed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The way was clear, and the fact that just then
the gay old moon condescended to poke her smiling
face out from behind a mass of clouds assisted
more or less in giving the pilot some of the
necessary illumination—the rest must be left to
his native sagacity and instinct.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a bunch of cottonwoods at some
little distance ahead, the location of which Perk
had pointed out to his mate before settling down
in his seat but if all went well Jack calculated
to be able to clear them in good shape—did it
seem necessary he could swerve slightly to the
right, and have a clear field for the take-off.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a little shouting as the friendly
plane started to taxi along, but of course this was
smothered by the increasing roar of exhaust and
spinning propeller. Faster and faster they scurried
onward, and then started to rise on an angle
just sufficient to nicely clear the tops of the cottonwoods;
when Jack jazzed his motor, to find
it running as “sweet as a purring cat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So they departed only a short time after making
that landing which humanity had demanded
and in times to come the little episode was
likely to afford both aviators more or less satisfaction,
in that they had “seen their duty and
done it,” as Perk would say in his whimsical
way.</p>

<p class='c013'>As they continued on their way Perk found
himself wondering if this interesting adventure
was destined to be a sample of other equally
thrilling happenings in store for them the further
they dipped into the great game that had been
laid at their door by the powers that be at Washington.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whenever he came to thinking of the audacity
shown by Slippery Slim in virtually defying all
the authority of the Government, Perk would
feel his dander rising as if in great indignation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh!” he at one time told himself, being
rather fond of thus communing, as his thoughts
ran on, “we’ll call <i>his</i> bluff just the same, the
scaly ol’ gila monster, you wait an’ see. Thinks
he’s the whole works, the boss man-handler, does
he, just ’cause he’s outguessed a number o’ the
boys. This time he’s due to find himself up
against guys o’ the right size, who’ll jerk him
down off’n his high perch in a jiffy, or I miss
my ticket.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk kept on boasting in his customary
fashion, possibly to keep his mind on the subject.
Jack was paying little attention to side issues
just then for he knew his pal’s peculiarities, and
short-comings as well and having “exhausted
his boiler” Perk presently lapsed into utter
silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had climbed to a fairly high ceiling, and
caught only occasional fugitive glimpses of the
earth far below, when the moon chanced to break
through the banks of clouds, which intervals
became less and less frequent, Jack noticed.</p>

<p class='c013'>He did not altogether fancy the looks of the
heavens, by degrees becoming more and more
overcast; still, this might after all mean next to
nothing and their business was to keep steadily
on their way as if things were bound to come out
all right.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was now drawing well on toward midnight,
and they had placed hundreds of miles between
the city of their recent stay and themselves. Long
since Perk had taken what proved to be his last
glimpse of the vast gulf as seen far away toward
the south, when the night was brightly illuminated,
with the moon’s silvery rays shining on the
glistening waters, and making a picture that
even appealed to Perk’s rugged nature—after
that all he was able to make out was the monotonous
level plains that lay in every quarter,
as though the whole earth consisted of this same
stock country.</p>

<p class='c013'>No longer were they able to find any cheer in
the company of the moon, for the canopy above,
earlier in the night peopled by a multitude of
bright stars, was now gripped in dense masses
of clouds.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having thus lost his guide marks below, Jack
was compelled to place all dependence upon his
faithful instruments, but this of course was an
old story to one of his experience, so that he did
not do any worrying on that score.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, buried in his own thoughts, and paying
scant heed to what changes were taking place
in the signs of the weather, had no warning until
suddenly there came a dazzling flash, that was
almost instantly succeeded by a tremendous burst
of thunder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ginger pop! that means we’re booked for a
bit o’ storm, mebbe, eh, Jack?” was his startled
exclamation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s hope it turns out to be <i>only</i> a bluster,”
the pilot went on to say, as he turned the nose of
his ship upward, and commenced to climb, evidently
in hopes that by so doing they might get
above those low hanging clouds, and have clear
sailing while the disturbance lasted.</p>

<p class='c013'>When shortly afterwards a second electrical
crash almost stunned them by its violence, Perk
began to fumble for his oilskin coat, which he
was never without when aboard a boat with an
open cockpit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk could take a ducking with as much good
nature as the next fellow but just the same he
did not intend to get soaked if he could help it,
since a continuance of the flight, with a cold wind
likely to follow the rain, would not prove to be
the most delightful experience possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>No sooner had he accomplished the job of
securing his raincoat than he gave Jack the well
known signal that he meant to take over the
stick, and thus allow his comrade to also protect
himself against bad weather.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly both of them were presently thus
equipped, and ready to take whatever might be
in the offing. Meanwhile the ascent was continued
in spasms, for there was always a chance
of getting above such a storm, and avoiding the
worst of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The thunder claps became more frequent, and
also much louder, so that each sudden burst gave
them both a thrill, death seemed so close, for
should their speeding ship chance to attract one
of those dazzling bolts it would be all over for
the daring air adventurers, and no one be the
wiser concerning their taking-off, until possibly
after long months had passed, their bleached
bones might be discovered by some party of
plainsmen out looking for rustlers or seeking to
round up missing stock.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus far not a single drop of rain had fallen,
according to Perk’s calculations but the coming
of the drenching flood could not be much longer
delayed, he felt positive. Had there not been
so much racket around them those keen ears of
his might have detected a rushing sound in the
near distance, like the roar of the incoming tide
on the sandy shores of the gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then it came with a swoop, the wind whistling
around their ears and the rain beating a tattoo
against the fuselage of the ship, as well as striking
them smartly in the face, despite such protection
as their helmets and heavy goggles afforded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack certainly had his hands full in managing
the bobbing, shifting craft, gripped by those
shifty gusts that came with giant force, making
the flyers feel as though they were clinging to a
mere chip tossed about in the wild fury of a
Texas tempest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Time and again did Perk feel as though his
heart had jumped up in his throat, almost choking
him; seasoned veteran at this sort of thing
as he believed himself to be, he could not help
this feeling of helplessness in the hands of the
aroused elements; yet each time Jack managed
to bring their ship through the teeth of the storm
in a way that was next door to miraculous, and
if Perk had up to this time not fully appreciated
the astonishing skill and confidence of his younger
companion while at the controls in an emergency,
he certainly was getting his lesson then and
there, in a way to cause it to sink deep, and stick.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch17' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVII <br /> <br />A FIGHT WELL WON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was no longer possible for the busy pilot to
keep on his course. Every minute of his time
was taken up with a desperate effort to keep
from being thrown into a nose dive, that, unless
miraculously conquered, would be likely to
send them whirling down, to crash from a five
thousand foot ceiling, and thus bring about a
complete writeoff.</p>

<p class='c013'>That however was the least of Jack’s worries—all
he asked was the ability and luck to be
able to fend off threatening disaster; could this
be done successfully in good time they could
pick up all that was lost, and once more continue
their westward flight.</p>

<p class='c013'>The battering they endured was simply tremendous,
and Jack marveled at the ship being
able to withstand such a horrible strain. If
but a single strut gave way under all that pounding
it would mean starting a series of similar
mishaps such as would quickly render them incapable
of keeping aloft; and with this threat
hanging over their heads it can readily be understood
neither of the two could be in a comfortable
frame of mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still it is wonderful how men thus threatened
will continue to carry on, although in an almost
mechanical fashion, doing just the necessary
thing with each change of pace on the part of
the tricky storm, and meeting successfully every
near tragedy as it arises to clutch them in its
grip.</p>

<p class='c013'>No longer did Jack keep on climbing—it
seemed to him that the further the staggering
boat lifted the more dangerous became their
situation for the air was surcharged with electricity
as the zigzag lightning darted from cloud
to cloud, doubling the chances of their frail
craft being struck.</p>

<p class='c013'>In fact it seemed so terrible above that he
lacked the nerve to persist in the upward work,
and even commenced to drop down. Perk
noticing this move, hardly knew what to make
of it. He was, as he himself would have expressed
it, “hanging on by his teeth,” in order
to keep his seat in the wildly plunging airship
and on finding that the bold pilot had given up
hope of finding relief in the upper regions, the
fact appalled him. Could it be Jack had decided
to attempt a landing, with only the glare
of those repeated electrical flashes to serve as
airport lights? That indeed would be next to
admitting their case as hopeless, and that Jack
was taking such desperate chances only as a last
resort.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were zooming along all this time as if
pursued by a jinx and indeed with such weird
accompaniments it would not be hard to believe
the spirit of the storm took on the part of such a
goblin of the air, to pursue relentlessly this bold
invader of the home of the aroused elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk hit the bullseye close to the center when
afterwards, in describing their experience on
this night of the great blow, he vowed they were
“playing dice with death,” since it seemed a bare
chance that they could ever pull through alive.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such is the life of the aviator—one hour sailing
smoothly along, at peace with all mankind,
envying no man his following, and feeling himself
to be on the top of the world—the next and
he may be fighting with might and main the
mad demons of the air, his life hanging in the
balance, his strength ebbing fast, and unless the
little cherub aloft that is said to be watching
over each sailor, whether of the sea or the limitless
air, comes to the rescue, his fate is sealed,
and another modern Argonaut never comes back
again to the home port.</p>

<p class='c013'>It did not seem to be any the less exciting even
when they had succeeded in gaining a much
lower altitude; although possibly the danger
from those thunderbolts might have been somewhat
abated. Perk soon realized that his pilot
had no intention of trying for a landing in the
midst of such a turmoil and confusion, which
fact relieved his harried feelings to some extent.
Indeed, it would have been a mad proceeding,
and almost unheard of, since hardly the slightest
chance offered for the most skillful pilot to
reach the earth without disaster, such as making
a ground loop, and having the heavy engine bury
them under its weight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk endeavored to convince himself that
things were a bit easier since a lower altitude
had been effected but in so doing he feared he
was only deceiving himself—if anything at all
things were even worse,—although the drop
might not be so far, which was small comfort,
since it must mean their complete annihilation
if it befell them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had numerous spasms when he fancied
something was going amiss with their staunch
craft, although unable to decide the exact nature
of the imaginary trouble. Despite all these
chills, which must have been the products of his
excitement, they managed to hold out minute
after minute, which fact gave more or less cause
for renewed hope.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack must indeed be almost completely exhausted,
and yet he refused to give up the controls,
to which his hands seemed glued as though
riveted there. Perk punched his side numbers
of times, but could get no favorable response,
proving that the other deemed it too hazardous
a proceeding to change possession of the stick
while in the whirl of that shrieking gale—which
was indeed only another adaptation of the old
proverb “it is folly to change horses when crossing
a stream.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no means for communication with
each other, even though they may have wished
to do so, since the ear-phones had been discarded
with the donning of their slickers, and
could not be put back in position, owing to the
sudden bursting of the storm, and the necessity
for employing their hands in more useful pursuits.</p>

<p class='c013'>All Perk could do was to hang on, keeping
himself ready to seize hold should his companion
be suddenly compelled to release his grip
through sheer weariness—that, and keeping tabs
of the weather, so as to glean the first favorable
sign that came along, promising a let-up, or at
least a break.</p>

<p class='c013'>Judging from the heavy rain that had come
down in such a solid stream it must be reckoned
one of those dreadful cloud-bursts of which he,
Perk, had so often heard, but which thus far in
his experience he had never met up with. No
doubt rivers would be out of their beds long before
dawn although that angle of the situation
did not interest them in the least, since their
traveling would not be interfered with a particle,
if only the air proved inviting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yes, soon Perk believed he could detect a lessening
of the baffling crosswinds that had been
so trying to the pilot, keeping him continually
on the anxious seat—then, too, it struck him the
floods were growing weaker in the bargain;
which two facts gave poor Perk a feeling akin to
joy in the region of his heart, such as he may
have known on previous occasions, but that must
have been far down in his adventurous past.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to their altimeter they were something
like two thousand feet from the ground,
but of course never the faintest glimpse could
they secure of what lay beneath them, so poor
was the visibility, with all that torrent of water
pouring down as might a mountain cataract.</p>

<p class='c013'>This delightful feeling grew stronger as minutes
passed—at this rate he would soon be able
to influence tired Jack to renounce his frozen
hold on the stick, and turn the handling of the
ship over to his chum.</p>

<p class='c013'>In this frame of mind he again nudged the
other, but in turn received a negative shake of
the head, which meant there was “nothing doing”—in
other words, since the storm still raged,
even though in somewhat diminished violence,
they must not be too premature, and spoil it all
just when the victory seemed about to drop into
their hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>With what Perk hoped would prove to be a
last dying spurt the rain came pelting down,
after which it suddenly stopped as though an
unseen hand away up among the clouds, had
plugged the gap, and kept any more water from
running out—enough was enough, surely, Perk
was telling himself when he made this thrilling
discovery and for one he felt he had had sufficient
rain to last him the balance of that year.</p>

<p class='c013'>So too did the wind start to diminish its force,
also coming from one direction with more constancy—some
relief to Jack, that was certain,
since now he could know just how to steer his
turbulent craft so as to meet the force driving
against it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then what did Perk do but start getting his
ear-phones adjusted, being wild to hear a human
voice, after all that fiendish roaring and howling
kicked up by the raging elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>Why, already the atmosphere had cleared
enough for him to catch faint glimpses of what
lay beneath them—it looked as though they had
come to a stretch of country where the level
prairie had changed into rougher ground, with
deep swales, sometimes running into quite respectable
ravines and there were indications of
ridges ahead, which might even prove to be
fairly high, so that it would have been tempting
Providence had Jack dropped still lower, while
flying blind through all that welter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Talk to me ’bout luck,” the grateful Perk
was saying to himself, “I never ran ’cross anything
like <i>this</i>—they told me Jack must a been
born under a lucky star, an’ now I sure b’lieves
it to be the right stuff they were givin’ me, an’
no taffy either. But that was some fight, take
it from me, fellers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards Jack condescended to give
him the sign that he was willing to pass up the
job; whereat Perk quickly superseded him as
pilot, and saw the other sink back in his cramped
quarters as though unable to hold up his tired
arms a second longer. Apparently the relief
had come not a minute too soon, for he must have
been close to the point of utter exhaustion after
so long and violent a strain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Battered as the crate had been while the gale
lashed them so madly, it had stood up under the
buffeting most amazingly and Perk would
never have occasion to utter anything saving
words of praise for the model and its makers;
it must be as near perfection as aircraft are being
built these days of man’s victory over the
savage forces of the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Setting his course in what he believed to be the
proper direction Perk waited until Jack seemed
fairly well recovered, when he was pleased to
see the other take up his head harness as though
he too felt the necessity for opening up communications
with his running mate, which outlook
gratified Perk immensely.</p>

<p class='c013'>There were many things he wished to have
made clear, and besides, he felt more than curious
to learn what Jack’s next move might turn
out to be—that they had drifted far from their
original course went without saying but a means
must be found to recover the lost ground, after
which they could take up the game again just
where the sudden storm had caused such a diversion.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then the moon peeped out through a
break in the clouds overhead, as though to tell
them it was all over, with decent weather once
more in the offing.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch18' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVIII <br /> <br />THE DESERTED SHACK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Well, that’s somehow I guess over, and I’m
mighty glad,” was the way Perk voiced his feelings,
when the clouds were rolling away, and the
heavenly host of stars backed up the moon in
lighting up the firmament.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Same here,” echoed Jack, still more or less
tired after his energetic battle with the unleashed
elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And strikes me the air’s got some chilly,”
added the other; “I own up I’m shivering to
beat the band right now. Where d’ye figger we
might be, partner—must a lost our course in all
that kettle o’ rain an’ wind, an’ drifted far to
the south, eh, what, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question about it, Perk; I could feel the
pull right along; still, there wasn’t a thing to do
but let the old crate take the reins in her teeth.
Once morning comes we’ll manage somehow to
get a line on our locality, and swing back to our
course.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some hours off yet,” ventured Perk, whose
lips were indeed trembling, as if the chill was
beginning to get in its work—perhaps all that
recent excitement was helping to make him
shiver, as it often will, even in the case of the
most valiant of men.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack noticed this fact, even though he himself
experienced nothing similar, for some reason or
other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Perk, you ought to have a chance
to sit alongside a warm fire and dry off; the rain
must have got under your slicker, and I reckon
now you’re slopping around in water back there.
Something’s <i>got</i> to be done about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! boss, don’t bother ’bout me; I’m a
hard-shell you must know, an’ a little dampness
ain’t agoin’ to do me any harm, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just the same we’ll try and make a landing,”
continued the other, “if there’s half a chance;
all I’d want would be to stack up against a level
stretch of upland, where the drainage had carried
off all that flood.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, that sounds all to the good, boy but
what difference will it make, I want to know?
After such a storm it’s bound to be some cold
even away down here along the Texas-Arizona
line; they call them Northers, jest like I’ve heard
they do down in Florida. Forget it, partner—I’m
a tough guy, an’ ain’t wantin’ to be coddled
like a baby.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just the same I say we’re going to land, if
half a chance shows up,” affirmed the pilot, in
that set way of his. “We’ll find the stuff to build
some sort of fire, Perk, where you could make
a pot of hot coffee; which’d do you more good
than a switch of hard liquor. Put that in your
pipe and smoke it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk remained silent for almost two whole
minutes, during which time no doubt he was
revolving in his mind what Jack had proposed—in
imagination he could almost <i>smell</i> the delicious
aroma of the coffee, boiling so merrily
over the red coals and even feel a joyous sensation
of warmth stealing through his chilled body.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Okay, Jack; you win, hands down. Me for
the coffee every time, to be followed by a quiet
smoke o’ my fav’rite brand o’ tobac. Have your
own way about it, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then get ready to try and make out what
sort of ground we’ll soon be passing over,” added
Jack, as he turned the ship earthward, and slid
down on a long glide, with the motor clamped
shut. “We’ll skim along close enough for you
to get a good idea as to how matters stand, and
yet giving enough distance to keep clear of any
clump of trees, or little bald knobs of rises.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently Perk assured him he could manage
to get fair glimpses at what lay below; at which
Jack again started on an even keel, moving with
as little speed as was compatible with safety.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not very long before the watcher gave
tongue.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Looks good to me down yonder, partner—guess
now we might make a safe an’ sane landin’—’specially
with <i>you</i> at the stick. Circulate
a little bit to the south, brother, ’cause it looks
some better thataways.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This Jack did, and then at another signal from
the observer, he proceeded to drop down with
almost as much confidence as he might have felt
when making a landing on Candler Field, well
lighted, and with every convenience suited to
safety and comfort.</p>

<p class='c013'>His confidence, it seemed, had not been misplaced,
for they effected a very fair contact, all
things considered, even though the landing was
somewhat “joggly and rough” as Perk expressed
it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once the ship came to a stop and both of them
hastened to clamber out of their close quarters—“cribbed,
cabined and confined,” Jack sometimes
liked to say in connection with their limited
cockpit, although his pal always reminded him
of the fact that <i>cabin</i> was something only conspicuous
by its absence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk’s first movement was to start threshing
his arms against his thighs with more or less
vigor, in which he showed good common sense
since there is no better method for stirring up
sluggish circulation after a long period of inaction.
Jack on his part commenced to check
up on certain sections of the undergear, meaning
to make certain he had done no damage in making
connection with the earth under such unfavorable
conditions.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything in ship-shape, I reckon, Perk,”
he announced. “And now let’s make out to find
something in the line of trees, where we might
pick up enough wood for that fire.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Looks kinder like things’d be mighty well
soaked after all that downpour,” affirmed the
shrewd Yankee-Canadian; “so it’d be a tough
job coaxin’ stuff to take fire. But wait a minute,
partner—I didn’t get a chance to tell you that I
spied what looked like an ol’ tumbledown shack
over to windward—I guess now it might be
abandoned, but just the same, partner, we’d be
apt to run across some dry wood inside.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suppose you step over and take a look-in,
Perk,” suggested the other. “I’ll stand by the
crate here, and keep our little glim working, so
you’ll get your bearings when you start back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, Jack,” acceded the lanky one,
always eager for any sort of service; “an’ by the
same token now I’ll tote my gun along—never
c’n tell what sorter game you’ll stack up against
on these here Texas plains, I’m told. I feel like
I could knock over a wolf er two, just to get my
blood to movin’ at a faster clip—how ’bout it,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suit yourself, Perk,” he was told, as Jack
climbed back into the cockpit so as to manipulate
the light he mentioned, and which would prove
sufficient to serve the wanderer as a beacon when
wishing to retrace his steps.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly Perk wandered off, having decided
as to the quarter where he had glimpsed
what looked like an old and lonely shack or
cabin, faintly seen in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>He came back in a short time, bubbling over
with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all right, Jack—just like I guessed, it
turned out to be an ownerless shack but the roof
looks like it might’ve shed the rain, an’ oh! boy!
heaps o’ dry wood inside, with a whoppin’ big
fireplace where you could slap on the biggest
log agoin’. Mebbe I ain’t glad you thought o’
this game. Come along, an’ we’ll fetch the stuff
for a warm snack—coffee, crackers, an’ bacon
in the bargain. Talk to me about luck, it’s comin’
to us in big chunks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! we’ve got to get used to that sort of
thing,” said Jack, in the most matter-of-fact tone
imaginable; “when you’re on such a wonderful
lay as this anything’s likely to happen, and all
kinds of surprises spring out at you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder,” was all Perk could say in reply;
but he lost no time in gathering together such
articles as aluminum coffeepot, skillet, cups, and
such other things as he knew would be needed to
complete their little midnight spread.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon it’s safe for us to leave our crate
off here,” remarked the cautious Jack, “but I’ll
fix things so no busybody can take-off while we’re
away,” which he did without any trouble; after
which they both set out to move along to the
deserted shack Perk had located, lying right
there, just as if a favoring Fate had designed it
for their especial benefit in an emergency, as
the grateful Perk told himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Arriving at the humble shack, that once may
have housed a happy family in days that were
gone, they made use of Jack’s electric torch in
order to gather some dry splinters of wood,
which, heaped above some paper on the open
hearth, soon blazed up, and afforded them an
opportunity to take a look around.</p>

<p class='c013'>Other fuel more lasting was hurriedly added
to the fire, and this done the two air adventurers
took stock of their surroundings. There was
nothing much to see, since the shack happened
to be entirely devoid of any kind of furniture,
even of the most primitive make; but the roof
had stood the ravages of time, and promised to
hold out for years still to come.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk held out his chilled hands to the blaze
but only for a few minutes; apparently the possibility
of brewing some “nectar” was an overpowering
temptation, for presently he started to
work.</p>

<p class='c013'>In short order he had the steam coming out
of the coffee pot spout, and a most delightful
odor permeated the interior of that ancient
shack. When the coffee was ready, Perk poured
some of the amber fluid in both aluminum cups,
and offered Jack one, together with a freshly
opened carton of tempting crackers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goes right to the spot,” the self-made <i>chef</i>
observed, rubbing a hand across his stomach, as
though experiencing the most blissful sensation
there; “best coffee I ever tasted, barrin’ none,
an’ say, I’ve tried it a good many places like
France and Germany, as well as in Turkey too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Same here,” Jack assured him, as he drained
his first cup. “By the way, didn’t you say you’d
fetched some bacon along over here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jest what I did, partner, an’ now I’ve had
my fust swaller o’ coffee I’ll get a move on an’
soon have some o’ the same asizzlin’ in the pan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He started to carry out his words, with the
interested Jack watching his efforts to try and
make the frying pan set evenly on the fire, a feat
that requires considerable knowledge of camp
tactics in order to be successful. After one near
spill, with Perk only saving an upset by quick
work, Jack modestly broke in to give a bit of
advice, not forgetting, however, that old saying
about “too many cooks spoil the broth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too hot to keep hold of the handle looks like,
partner; now if only we were outdoors we might
find stones enough to form some sort of foundation
on three sides of the fire, where you could
rest your pan. Hold on, here’s this old hearth
that was made of some kind of Mexican bricks—adobe
they call them and it looks to me like
some of ’em might be loose. Here, I’ll manage to
pry a few up for you, Perk, old man—just hold—your—horses
and——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did not finish his sentence, and the cook,
glancing up to see what ailed him, found his
pal holding the first adobe in an uplifted hand,
while he was himself staring hard into the cavity
from which it had come, as if he saw something
wonderfully fascinating there!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch19' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIX <br /> <br />FORTUNE KNOCKS AT THE DOOR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“I swan! what’s the matter, partner—my
sakes; is it a <i>rattler</i> you uncovered, I wanter
know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk on his part was already sharing the excitement
of his pal, although apparently from
an entirely different reason. He had already
started to scramble to his knees, being doubtless
bent on taking some aggressive action, when he
saw Jack reach forward and deliberately pluck
some object from the hole under the displaced
adobe fire brick, and hold it up to view.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he saw its nature Perk’s jaw dropped, and
he was the picture of abject astonishment—but
it was far from being any poisonous reptile that
Jack was thus exhibiting with such a grand
flourish; just as though he might be some necromancer
or magician, and drawing all manner of
amazing things out of an apparently empty
stove-pipe hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gosh-a-mighty! that looks like real money!
I swan!” burst from Perk’s lips, as he continued
to stare.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just what it’s supposed to be, Pal Perk,”
said Jack, trying to keep his own voice from
displaying a genuine tremolo—“a neat wad of
it, waiting here for us to drop in and pick it up.
Seems like things might be set up, like tenpins
in the alley, for two lucky dogs to knock down
with a couple of rolled balls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If that don’t beat anything I ever did see,”
continued the astounded Perk, now grinning, as
though the pleasant nature of their find was
commencing to appeal to him. “Jest think o’ a
pair o’ air tramps ahappenin’ along, runnin’
across this here deserted shack, an’ findin’ a fortune
askin’ to be taken care of—don’t it beat the
Dutch what c’n happen—Arabian Night’s adventures
can’t hold a candle to the real thing in
these modern days. Some ol’ miser musta hid
that boodle under the bricks, so’s to keep the
Mex raiders comin’ up over the international
border from gettin’ their itchin’ fingers on it—how
’bout that, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Off color, I’m afraid, Perk,” Jack told him,
after taking a quick look at his wonderful find
in the hearth <i>cache</i>; “that miser story might go
with some but it doesn’t wash with me worth
a red cent. In the first place if this money had
been hidden here by a miser, he’d have taken it
away with him when he cut stick. Then again
it would surely have been partly in hard cash,
like gold eagles, and such stuff—all hoards of
misers, you remember, are made up like that,
Perk, and when you give this the once-over
you’ll also notice how it’s all in bills, mostly
fresh ones at that, as if they hadn’t seen much
circulation, as you might say.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk drew in a long breath, and continued to
stare hard at the object Jack was holding out in
front of him; it might be that something in the
other’s words and manner suggested certain possibilities
that seemed almost too staggering for
poor Perk to digest offhand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gee whittiker jewsharps! Jack—what’s this
you’re hintin’ at, ol’ pal—give it to me easy-like,
so I c’n swaller it—all in bills—mostly
fresh ones at that—not seen much handlin’
around—say, are you tryin’ to tell me they’re
every one five dollar bills,—Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon that’s what they are, Perk, I’d say,
from taking a quick look at the same.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bad currency—counterfeits—bogus stuff, er—what?”
gasped the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look for yourself, and you’ll recognize them
as having been printed from the same plates as
the one we’re carrying with us as a sample of
Slippery Slim’s best work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Je-ru-salem crickets! I’m knocked silly for
a fact,” whimpered Perk; and then, as if mustering
up his vanishing stamina he went on to add:
“but however could they’ve got right there under
that brick—conjurer’s black magic, looks
like to me, partner, it sure does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nonsense! that part of it is easy enough to
figure out,” asserted Jack, as usual very matter-of-fact;
“the only thing that seems to border on
the miraculous is our running across this packet
of all the people in the Far West—it looks to
me as if some sort of Destiny might be handling
the cards—that all we have to do is to keep moving
and everything’s bound to come our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure does seem like a snap, and that’s a fact,”
agreed Perk, calming down a little as he began
to grow more accustomed to the great discovery
that had resulted from their deciding to drop
down, and have a sociable cup of hot coffee;
“but I’ll be danged if I c’n make head or tail
out o’ this happening—now, what under the sun
did anybody want to stick that wad o’ long green
under the same adobes, I’d like to know, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! there might be any number of answers
to that question, Perk; for instance didn’t we
learn that it was the habit of Slim, or one of his
busy bees, to jump across the border every little
while with a load of the flimsy, and dole the stuff
out to a number of agents he has working with
him in this section of the country, also all the
way over to Los Angeles and San Diego?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was the spiel they gave us, for a fact,
boss,” admitted Perk, wagging his head eagerly,
as though he felt certain clever Jack would be
able to figure things out, and hit on some sort of
explanation that would cover these mysterious
happenings.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, this, then, might be one of his hidden
<i>caches</i>—at certain times this unknown agent
hides some <i>real</i> money in such a hole as this, and
comes along another dark night it might be to
pick up the big wad that was left in exchange
for the small one he contributed. And that is
the way the game runs, so I was told.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“By gum! but what grand luck for us to come
in on this deal, Jack—pretty soft, I’d call it,
and neither of us had any hand in it either—just
hit on this little bank by sheer chance! Goin’
to crib the loot, are you, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack scratched his head as though certain
plans were flitting through it, and he must make
a choice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, we have to start somewhere, you understand,
Perk, and it looks like the finger of
Fate might be pointing right at this shack, and
telling us to get busy and pick up a strong clue
that, if followed up, would take us straight to
that hideout Slim’s got across in Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess I see what you mean now, brother,”
ventured Perk, his face lighting up with extreme
joy; for he felt they were already on the track,
and that from that hour there must be rapid
action continuously. “If so be that ’ere critter
that slams out these bills on greenhorns and
come-ons is gettin’ anxious to see what sorter
prize he’s drawn in the lottery, why, he might
jest come along any ol’ time now, since the
storm’s over an’ there’s nawthin’ to hold him up.
Got any idea he’s nigh due here, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shouldn’t be a bit surprised if he walked in
on us any time,” ventured Jack; and then, seeing
the puzzled look on his chum’s rugged face
he went on to add: “I didn’t mention the fact
but while we were making our way over from
the ship I felt certain I glimpsed several far-off
lights, as if they might be in windows of cabins
or houses of some sort. Then, too, I surely did
hear a big dog barking, and something like a
rooster crowing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I’ll be jiggered if you ain’t got sharper
ears than I c’n boast, Jack, ol’ hoss, which ain’t
no lie either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t you believe it, Perk; it just happened
that you were so wrapped up in thinking of that
coffee treat you didn’t pay as much attention to
outside things as I did. So it seems as if there
might be some kind of a village or prairie town
not more than two miles from this abandoned
old shack and if that’s so then the chances are
this agent who’s been working the public for
Slim probably lives there. Then again, like as
not he has a pretty good idea about when his
bunch of kale ought to be placed under that
brick—in fact he might have made his way out
here this very night only for the storm threatening.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, partner,” Perk hastened to say, brimful
of energy, “which, bein’ the case, it’s up to
us to lay a sweet little mantrap, so’s to trip him
by the heels if so be he knocks on our door.
How’ll we fetch it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“First of all we’ll finish our supper, and clean
up here,” came the ready explanation; “he may
smell the odor of coffee and bacon, but then you
might expect this shelter to be used once in a
while by Mexican tramps, or passing cowboys,
especially when a big storm threatens, so that
isn’t going to scare the Johnny. As for us, we’ll
fix things so as to give him a nice little surprise,
by hiding out, after making things all dark inside
here, with water thrown on the fire to
smother the hot coals, after which there’s nothing
to do but take things easy until he shows up—if
he does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sabbe, okay, partner; let’s get busy, for
the bacon’s done brown to a turn.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch20' class='c014'>CHAPTER XX <br /> <br />SPRINGING THE TRAP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There was much that must be done before they
could feel satisfied they had their mantrap arranged.
Jack realized that if the party who
played the part of local agent for the counterfeiter
gang had been kept from coming to secure
the fresh supply of bogus bills by the threatening
storm, he was likely to make his appearance
at almost any time, since all danger from the
electrical disturbance was now past.</p>

<p class='c013'>They finished their little supper without
wasting any more time, after which the matter
of hiding all traces of their presence was taken
up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See if you can find any water outdoors,
Perk,” Jack was saying, as he contemplated the
red embers of their late fire. “Seems to me I
stepped in some sort of a puddle while coming
up to the door. Here’s an old rusty can that
looks as if it’d hold a quantity—I want to dash
it on these coals so as to cool them off. That
done we’ll find some way to hide, and watch developments.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk sized up the situation cleverly enough,
and lost no time in setting about doing as his pal
suggested. When he came back he was carrying
the rusty can, which did leak a trifle, but
then that made no particular difference, so long
as enough water remained to put the fire out.</p>

<p class='c013'>It sizzled, and steamed a bit but Perk distributed
the fluid contents of his can with such
discretion that all this was speedily brought to
a finish, with the last red ember cooled off, leaving
a dead little pile of wood ashes as the only
reminder of their blaze.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now that’s settled, partner,” said the always
ready Perk, “what comes next on our program?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had his hand electric torch in use, for
otherwise they must have been left to grope
around, since the clouds continued to drift past
in clusters, shutting out most of the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We must gather up everything here that
might give us away, for like as not the fellow’ll
fetch some kind of a light along with him—lantern
it may turn out to be, because he knows its
apt to be pretty dark inside the old shack, and
he can’t do much just by fumbling around.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! that’s right, boss,” returned Perk,
commencing to gather up any and all their
scanty belongings, not forgetting that convenient
rifle of his. “But I say, how ’bout the bus—won’t
he lamp the thing settin’ there in the open
an’ ain’t it apt to give him a bad start?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had duly considered that very point in
making up his plans, and was ready to meet the
situation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Taken it all in all, buddy, there’s small danger
of that happening,” he went on to tell Perk.
“First, remember, the ship lies on that side of
the shack away from the spot where I glimpsed
those lights and if he comes along in a direct
line from the town there isn’t one chance in three
of him noticing it. Even if he does I reckon
he’ll feel dead certain only his own messenger’d
be flying in this region—he may never have seen
another crate besides the one sent out by Slippery
Slim.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She sounds good to me, Jack an’ I’m willin’
to take a shy at the target, if so be you guess it’s
straight goods, all wool’n a yard wide. Let’s
go!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly both passed out of the deserted
shack that had proved such a fortunate harbor
for them after the late storm. Jack knew what
they must do in following up the little plan he
had framed, with a view of giving the suspect
the shock of his life and without any further
preliminaries he set about carrying out the few
details.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a chink or two in this further wall,”
he went on to say, in a low voice, next door to a
whisper, “that will furnish us means for keeping
tabs on what’s going on inside. We’ll settle down
there, and just wait. As luck has it that side of
the shack is away from the moon, which is all in
our favor, in fact everything seems to be arranged
just to suit our plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bully set-up, boss, couldn’t be better for a
fact,” agreed the hopeful Perk, who firmly believed
in the element of Luck, and was immensely
gratified to discover how that little god
was working over-time in their favor—according
to his way of thinking it was always “better
to be born lucky than rich.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it?” whispered Jack, after they
had commenced to crouch down in the darkened
spot he had selected.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just great, that’s all,” Perk assured him,
“show me where one o’ them cracks c’n be located,
partner, an’ then I’ll be okay—all
fixed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack obliged by directing his chum’s hand to
an opening, through which it would be easy
enough to keep watch over any happening inside
the shack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Next we’ll creep over to this further corner,
and try to find out when he comes along,”
continued Jack. “From now on, Perk, keep
your tongue between your teeth—no talking, remember,
but if it does seem to be absolutely
necessary, put your lips close to my ear, and
whisper—get that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nuff sed, boss, I’m on,” came faintly from
the figure crouching at Jack’s side, after which
abject silence fell upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>A little later on Perk, now that his hearing
was strained so as to pick up any kind of sound,
however slight, caught the barking of a watchdog;
it seemed to be at a considerable distance
from the shack, and he judged there might be a
couple of miles lying between. This was not a
great amount of ground to cover, if only the inducement
were sufficiently urgent and that fat
packet of enticing bank bills, supposed to be
secreted under the adobes of the old hearth, must
represent an alluring prize, capable of drawing
a chap who was fond of “easy money” out of his
snug home at this unseasonable hour of the
night, and indulging in a little hike, for which
effort he would fancy himself well repaid.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some time passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>They lay there just back of the comer of the
dilapidated and abandoned shack, waiting, listening,
and frequently feeling a little thrill when
some soft sound came stealing to their ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Perk plainly heard what was surely a
low cough, such as might be caused by a sudden
tickling in the throat. Some one was undoubtedly
approaching the spot, and coming from the
west, where they understood the prairie hamlet,
or village, lay at the foot of a small ridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>He merely touched his companion’s right arm
to let Jack know something was in the wind.
The cough was repeated, so that Perk chuckled
softly to himself, as if more than ever convinced
that luck was bent on handing them out further
fat plums.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was already creeping back so as to reach
the spot where those convenient peepholes could
be found and of course Perk imitated his example.
Thus it came about they were in complete
readiness to make good use of their eyes
when a slight scratching sound came from
within, and a tiny flash announced that the newcomer
had struck a match.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk could see him there down on his knees,
and intent on applying his lighted match to the
wick of a lantern he had evidently fetched along
for this very purpose. If Perk could have analyzed
the feeling that possessed him just then he
must have compared it to the exultation of a cat
when about to make a jump upon a sparrow,
close up to which he had managed to hide, all
prepared for the finishing act of the ambush.</p>

<p class='c013'>No sooner had the man succeeded in lighting
his lantern than with eager hands he commenced
lifting the adobe under which Jack had again
artfully placed the bait in the shape of that
tempting packet of bogus notes.</p>

<p class='c013'>How eagerly he pounced on the contents of
his queer <i>cache</i>, all the avariciousness of a miser
handling his hoard was displayed and at the
same time he looked hurriedly from one side to
the other, as though his guilty soul, conscious of
having thus broken the law of his country, was
already seeing the long arm of Justice stretching
out menacingly toward him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack evidently had seen enough to satisfy him
the genuine criminal was in focus, and that there
could be no miscarriage of Justice in effecting
his capture with the goods upon him. He was
creeping toward the open door of the shack, evidently
bent on taking the slick partner of the
counterfeiter chief by surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk lost no time in crawling at his pal’s heels,
bent on having a hand in the closing scene of the
little drama—he wanted to see with his own
eyes just how such a slimy beast would take his
“bump” when he found the meshes of the net
closing around him.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon looking in at the open door.
The man still knelt there on the hard earthen
floor of the shack, and appeared to be nervously
fumbling the sheaf of bills, as though trying to
count them, and be assured that he had received
the full amount to which he was entitled—that
there had been no “holdout” attempted.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps one of them happened to make a
slight sound—either that, or else the man’s guilty
soul caused him to fancy he heard something
for he turned his head. It chanced that the
light of the lantern fell full upon his dark face,
and disclosed the distended eyes filled with terror,
as well as the expression so ghastly that
passed athwart his countenance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put ’em up!” commanded Jack, sharply, in
a voice that would brook no nonsense and as if
mechanically influenced to obey, the wretched
trapped distributor of bad notes raised both
hands, the packet falling to the floor as if his
nerveless fingers could no longer retain their
grip.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and Perk stepped blithely into the
lighted shack, the former with his ready automatic
covering the badly shaken rogue, Perk
trailing his rifle in a suggestive way, as if able
to back his boss up on the slightest provocation.</p>

<p class='c013'>First frisking the other, and removing a gun
from his back pocket, Jack made a motion with
his hand as he set Perk to work.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get the bracelets on him, partner, then we’ll
ask him a few leading questions before we make
up our minds what the next step’ll be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But—hold on, Mister,” whined the poor
devil, all aquiver as he groveled there on his
knees; “I ain’t done nawthin’—this hear ain’t
my stuff—I jest suspicioned Jud he must a had
somethin’ hid out this way, ’case he kep’ comin’
an’ agoin’, so I kim tuh see what it mout be. Now
I knows he must a robbed thet bank over in
Tucson when he went off with a gang he runs
with.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stow that gab,” said the disgusted Perk,
“that’s all too flimsy to wash. We got you to
rights an’ where the hair’s short, an’ you’ll have
a chanct to see what the inside o’ the pen at Atlanta’s
like. This here’s counterfeit long-green,
an’ you knows it, mister,” with which cutting
remark he snapped a pair of steel handcuffs
upon the other’s wrists with the skill only one
accustomed to handling such “safety-first” contraptions
could display, proving that for one of
Slippery Slim’s active lieutenants the show was
indeed over.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch21' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXI <br /> <br />PICKING UP CLUES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>By this time the man whom Uncle Sam’s two
clever sky detectives had trapped, showed signs
of being almost in a state of collapse. Too late
did he realize what a terrible mistake he had
made when yielding to the blandishments of
Slippery Slim Garrabrant, and acting under the
belief that he could defy the law and get away
with it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the big idea, partner,” Perk was asking
after he and Jack had fixed things so there
was no possible chance for their prisoner to
break away, and give them the laugh. “Do we
jump off right now, or wait till mornin’, I’d like
to know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No hurry at all,” was the calm reply, “I
want to go over our crate once more before we
start that hop across to the California border,
I’ve good reason to believe things are okay but
a second overhauling will satisfy me better.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I kinder guess you won’t want me to slip
over to this here town, an’ pick up a few fresh
eggs, eh, boss?” and Perk’s voice actually took
on a wheedling vein as he made this remark
for if there was anything he dearly loved along
the line of “eats” it was those same “fresh eggs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack shook his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hardly think it would be wise,” he observed;
“we don’t know the lay of the land for one thing—it
might be this party has some backing among
his neighbors, and we’d find ourselves in a hornets’
nest before we knew what was what. No,
we can stick it out here the balance of the night,
which is pretty well gone right now, and be off
about sunrise.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a lot more stuff around in here that’d
burn right well,” insinuated Perk; “how ’bout
another bit o’ fire—this night air feels some cool
to me an’ ’sides, we’d have a blaze ready so’s to
boil more coffee ’fore we kick off, eh, what,
partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Please yourself so far as that goes, Perk, I
reckon it wouldn’t feel at all bad to have some
fire, as we must hang out here several hours.
But don’t make any noise if you can help it.
Besides, we ought to keep an eye out for trouble,
no telling what this slick chap might work off
on us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! we’ll one o’ us keep watch off’n on,”
promised Perk, starting without any further delay
to gather some fuel, and get a blaze going.</p>

<p class='c013'>While he was thus engaged Jack took their
prisoner in hand, and commenced to grill him.
There was nothing of the dreaded “third degree”
rough-house measures in what Jack attempted
but he tried to show the man where his best interests
lay.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re in a bad fix, my friend,” Jack told
him: “and unless you come clean, so as to help
us round up the balance of your outfit, you’ll
be certain to get the full penalty the law lays
down. We know a whole lot about Slippery
Slim and his ways, and are dead certain we’re
bound to end up his graft before many more
days pass by. So when you’re answering my
questions don’t try to lie to me, for like as not
I’ll be already acquainted with the facts and
know you’re trying to beat around the bush.
Dangerous business, let me tell you; far better
for you to hold your tongue than deceive me.
Come clean, and I promise you I’ll do everything
in my power to have you let off easy, besides no
one need know you’ve turned State’s evidence.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he started in to put pointed questions,
concerning certain points that were vital to his
plans. Once he caught the man squirming under
the lash, and giving an answer that he very well
knew was like “beating around the bush.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know better than that, my friend,” he
told him sharply, “that’s only half a truth you’ve
given me. Don’t try it again if you know what’s
good for your health, or it’ll be a matter of possibly
ten years before you see your family again.
Stick to the truth, and it may be only a question
of six months you’ll spend at Atlanta behind the
bars. Now tell me again what I wanted to know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He had managed to impress his strong personality
upon the writhing wretch, who was
ready to throw himself unreservedly upon his
mercy and so the answers were given without
hesitation, although in some instances the man
declared he did not know, as he had only once
been across the line and visited Slippery Slim
in his hideout among the Mexican mountains.</p>

<p class='c013'>When Jack realized that he had really pumped
the other dry, he felt he had profited in many
ways and that their sudden determination to
make, a night landing, so as to recover after their
buffeting by the storm, had been a most fortunate
happening indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>For one thing he had learned that the name
of their frightened prisoner was Simeon Hawkins,
and that he had a wife and several children
living in the little prairie town only a few miles
distant—a fact that seemed to give him great
distress, now he found his avaricious dreams
wrecked, and himself in the hands of a couple
of those very same Secret Service detectives
whom the “big boss” had undoubtedly referred
to so contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had been “listening in,” and chuckling
happily whenever he realized his mate had made
some sort of a “ten-strike,” picking up valuable
information that was destined to ultimately
serve their ends wonderfully, and help to “pot
their game.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They sat there for some time, talking in low
tones. The man who lay close by helpless was
silent as a rule, although several times he uttered
a dismal groan, when his feelings overpowered
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess I’ll step out, partner,” remarked Perk
at one time, “an’ slip over to the ship, I’d sure
hate to have some critter do us a bad turn by
meddlin’ with any o’ them dials an’ gadgets.
What I wouldn’t do to <i>him</i> would be a caution,
that’s right.”</p>

<p class='c013'>From the fact that Perk carried his rifle along
with him his meaning was not difficult to understand
and Jack felt sorry for the chap who was
at the other end of the gun sights when his pal
pulled the trigger.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk cautiously approached the grounded
ship, and started when discovering some moving
object just in its shadow. The moon was shining
brightly now, so that it was an easy matter to see
for quite some little distance, although so deceptive
was the light that even sharp-eyed Perk
could hardly have told whether some dark object
seen fifty feet off was a stump or a black dog
sitting there and watching him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Waiting until the object moved again, he discovered
he had been wise to hold his fire, for by
then he had made it out to be some species of
animal. He took several forward steps, whereupon
the beast started to move off, uttering a
little nasty snarl while doing so.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks, on’y a stinkin’ kiote after all, skulkin’
’round to see if he c’n stir up a little grub o’ any
kind. Get out, you varmint!” and he waved his
gun above his head while starting to run forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>This completely demoralized the cowardly
prairie marauder, so that he took to his heels,
and quickly vanished in the near distance. Perk
found everything all right when he gave the
stranded plane “the once over”; and being satisfied
that there was nothing to be feared from a
coyote prowling around in search of a supper or
breakfast, he returned to the shack to report all
well.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was busily engaged making certain notes,
and reading others connected with their present
business, as jotted down in his memorandum
book in a peculiar brand of short-hand all his
own, but which would appear as so much Greek
or Choctaw to any one else.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Better turn in, and get a few winks of sleep,
brother,” he told Perk, who had yawned once or
twice as he sat before the fire. “I’ll wake you up
in about an hour or so when you can take your
turn playing sentinel, until the dawn shows up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just as you say, old hoss,” came the ready
reply; “fact is, I’m a bit drowsy, an’ could get
away with a few winks; but don’t forget to wake
me when the hour’s up, remember.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s all right, partner,” Jack told him,
laughingly; “we’re in this game thirty-thirty,
and you’ll have your turn, depend on it. Now
get busy, and don’t you dare snore above a whisper
either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I do jest gimme a poke, Jack—tryin’ to
break myself o’ that nasty habit but I got to
have help, you know—no feller ain’t wholly responsible
fur what he does when he’s asleep.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In due time Jack aroused the other, and himself
sought a brief period of forgetfulness in
sleep. So the balance of the night passed, and
morning came with a clear sky, and a promise of
decent weather for the continuance of their
flight.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch22' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXII <br /> <br />OVER ARIZONA DESERTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Perk must have dreamed about that hot coffee
treat he had been promising himself, for when
Jack opened his eyes he found his comrade already
watching the bubbling pot, from which
delightful odors were commencing to escape in
the way of steam.</p>

<p class='c013'>They enjoyed quite a decent little breakfast,
what with the ambrosia contained in their aluminum
cups together with some crackers and jam,
after the crisp bacon had been disposed of. Jack
offered some to their prisoner, but the man sadly
shook his head, as if to say he had no appetite
whatever.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was not a bad looking fellow, only with a
weak sort of chin, and evidently built along a
line that could be easily tempted to go wrong if
the inducement were only gilded enough. Jack
felt sorry for him, especially since he had learned
about his family; and was determined to do what
he could so as to get Simeon off, should his information
prove of any value to their cause.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once breakfast was disposed of they all went
over to where the ship lay. By this time Simeon
had found that they really planned to carry him
off with them, a startling fact that added to his
alarm, for apparently he had never been up in
a plane, and a species of stage-fright made him
shake as if he had the ague.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there was no other way to work things,
for should they set him free the chances were
the man, forgetting his promise, would try to
send out some kind of warning to Slippery Slim,
and in the end he and Perk were apt to pay dearly
for their slip-up, perhaps even with their own
lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>When playing such a desperate game with so
canny a lawbreaker it would be the height of
folly to let the dictates of tender hearts turn
them from the path of “safety first,” and Simeon
must continue to “take his medicine,” even
though the innocent ones at home suffered for
his misdeeds—he had never considered others
whom his evil actions had doubtless harmed,
when they found themselves arrested for passing
worthless bills, and how could he expect these
sworn officers of the law to go easy with him
when caught in the act?</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk now began to wonder just how they
would be able to “tote” a third party in the limited
accommodations afforded by the double
cockpit of their ship. It was bound to prove a
tight squeeze, and not so comfortable but then
why grumble on account of a trifle like that,
when Fortune was giving them such a glad hand
all the while?</p>

<p class='c013'>He began to shift things around some while
Jack was busy checking the motor, struts, undergear,
and propeller, with the design of condensing,
and making more room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Funny how you c’n jam things into such a
small compass when you really an’ truly try,”
he told Jack, when he had finished his task. “I
kinder guess I’ll be able to fix him okay, ’cause
he’s no great shakes at size, an’, seems like to
me, he’s shrinkin’ right afore my eyes, he’s that
shaky. Then it’s only for the day, I figger; how
’bout that, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve planned all that out, partner,” he was
told. “As soon as we get over to the California
border we’ll give him in charge of some sheriff
to keep in the hoosgow till we’ve made our killing,
and are ready to deliver the whole batch to
Uncle Sam’s nearest U. S. District Attorney,
at Los Angeles or San Diego. That clear to you,
Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say it was, boss, an’ here’s hopin’ we’ll
get there with both feet when the end shows up,
our prisoners hobbled, an’ with nice new steel
bracelets decoratin’ their wrists. Now to get
the gent aboard the boat, an’ stowed away.
Shucks! he acts like he might be scared out o’ a
year’s growth—some sillies get that way ’bout
goin’ up in a skyscraper the fust time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>His scorn for such a weakling showed in his
face as he helped Simeon to clamber into the
cockpit. The man was as white as a sheet, and
trembling as if expecting to meet with some dire
end in short order, once he left the firm ground
and took to the boundless air. His groans were
heartrending, and Jack felt sorry for the wretch
but for once Perk displayed no signs of sympathy,
it was all so silly in his opinion.</p>

<p class='c013'>He proceeded to take precautions by fastening
the greenhorn in by means of a stout strap which
would prevent his falling out should conditions
necessitate a sudden banking on the part of the
pilot, or a fierce gust of wind cause the ship to
give a unannounced plunge.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All ready, Jack,” announced Perk, after
completing these arrangements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll be with you inside of three minutes,” he
was told, and as the ground ahead had been examined,
and found to be fairly good for the
wheels to trundle over, there seemed to be nothing
more that could be done, only put things to
the test.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was “some rough,” as Perk told himself,
when violently shaken once or twice but they
managed to get up sufficient speed to admit of
Jack lifting her when the right time arrived.
Then they were off, rising like a bird, and almost
immediately opening up the village that nestled
there two miles off, at the foot of the low ridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack headed straight into the west, for that
was their route “as the crow flew.” He cared
not at all that they would pass directly over the
settlement, for few of the people were apt to be
abroad at such an early hour, nor would they
be any the wiser for seeing a plane pass overhead
at such a low altitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, looking down, found himself wondering
which of the modest cottages in line of his vision
chanced to be the home Simeon had spoken of
with such a catch in his voice. The man had
temporarily forgotten about his fears concerning
his own safety, while being carried so high above
the surface of the earth—he was stretching his
neck, and eagerly focussing his staring eyes on
one spot, which evidently held all that he held
dear. Perk ignored his recent sensation of scorn,
and actually felt sorry for the man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor guy,” he was saying under his breath,
though the other could not have heard him had
he shouted at the top of his lungs, on account of
the racket being kicked up by combined motor
and propeller, “he feels right bad ’cause he’s
goin’ off without a chanct to say goodbye. Well,
I on’y hope this will be a lesson to Simeon, an’
he’ll quit playin’ with a buzz-saw, which is the
long arm o’ our Uncle Samuel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon tried his best to keep tabs of the lonely
little hamlet until it was no longer possible to
distinguish objects, owing to the several miles
of distance the speeding plane had covered; then
he fell back in his seat, and let his head drop
on his chest, while his body shook with emotion.
In that dreadful moment he would undoubtedly
have only too gladly given all he had in the wide
world for a chance to undo the wrongs he had
committed in his haste to get rich.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! he orter thought o’ that before, while
the goin’ was good!” was Perk’s comment, who
had seen just such short-sighted men more than
once before in his eventful life, and had a philosophical
mind concerning all such late repentances.
“But I’m sure sorry for them that are
agoin’ to suffer the most—he deserves all he’ll
get, but they’re the innocent ducks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The plane soared along its set course, and as
they were not at more than something like five
thousand feet altitude, Perk could see very well,
when he adjusted the binoculars they carried of
necessity, so as to be able to spy out conditions
before trusting themselves to land, being naturally
a bit suspicious while thus drawing steadily
nearer to what might well be called enemy land.</p>

<p class='c013'>From time to time he found himself gazing
down with considerable curiosity upon scenes
which were mostly foreign to his eyes—he had
only too often scrutinized pictures where uncounted
troops belonging to the enemy were encamped,
or on the march, with monster guns
making the very air quiver with the tumult of
their discharges; where rival pilots came up in
answer to his insulting challenge, to engage him
in deadly combat—he had seen many an unlucky
or less skillful airman go down with his whirling,
blazing coffin, yielding up his life as a tribute
to what he called patriotism—all these and a
multitude of similar thrilling spectacles could
be unrolled in memory as he thus sailed the
azure sky, and saw Jack meet and conquer successive
air pockets lying in wait to give him battle;
and yet this was actually the first time Perk
had ever focussed his gaze upon a genuine cattle
ranch, and saw stock being driven to market,
or it might be mavericks branded; so that he
found himself entranced with the panorama
spread before him as they glided over the prairies
of New Mexico.</p>

<p class='c013'>There cropped up other and like interesting
sights when the wilder sector of country was
reached, with its deep gullies, its bare-topped
mountain peaks—perhaps stretches of desolate
desert where nothing could be seen save billowy
sandy wastes, except possibly patches of yucca,
sage, greasewood, and prickly pear cactus.</p>

<p class='c013'>When, his interest increasing, Perk begged
his comrade to drop down so as to give him a
nearer view of these strange sights, he was able
to increase his knowledge concerning the myriad
of strange sights to be picked up when touring
by air in new territories—now he could make
out the fantastic Joshua trees that seemed to be
engaged in a shimmering dance in the blazing
sunlight; moving shadows that sometimes crossed
the line of his vision he made out to be buzzards
on the wing, circling in search of their carrion
meal; while others on the ground he recognized
as coyotes skulking along, frightened by the sight
and noise coming from far over their heads, and
trying to reach their secret dens in some rocky
canyon or defile.</p>

<p class='c013'>Noon came in due time, with the ship keeping
up its steady grind, and having left hundreds of
miles in its wake.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk began to realize that he had eaten his
breakfast at an unearthly hour, and concluding
that a bite of something, together with a swig of
water from their jug, might go well, he mentioned
the interesting fact that the usual lunch
hour had come, at which Jack nodded his head,
as if to leave all that sort of thing to the discretion
of his trusted pard.</p>

<p class='c013'>So they had a pick-up snack, which was quite
acceptable to the two airmen, able to enjoy their
meals even while cutting capers up among the
clouds. It was another thing to the novice
Simeon, whose appetite had not come back,
though he did manage to swallow a few bites,
and have a drink of cold water to wash things
down. By slow degrees he was getting the upper
hand of his dreadful fears, for while familiarity
could not be said to bring contempt, nevertheless
he was becoming accustomed to the conditions,
and could even display a trace of curiosity
when looking down on some unusually interesting
spectacle to which Perk was pointing so
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>If things continued to exist as they had been
doing all morning it was likely—Jack at one time
told his co-pilot in answer to a question—that
they would be close to the California border by
sunset, or shortly afterwards; since even then
they were well along across Arizona, with fair
skies still beckoning them on their way.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch23' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIII <br /> <br />ON TO THE COLORADO</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Listen, Perk, I’ve got something you should
know—something that hinges on a change of
plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was saying this at a time when, relieved
from the controls he could enter into one of the
little confabs that their use of the ear-phones
allowed. All Perk had to do was to lean forward
and while still handling the stick drink
in whatever his co-pilot chose to say.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! spit it out then, partner,” was his familiar
way of inviting confidence and which
meant so much with those who knew Perk’s peculiar
sayings best.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be sure Simeon Hawkins was sitting close
beside Perk, and what Jack meant to confide in
his running mate could never be intended for
his ears but despite this elbow to elbow touch
there was not the slightest risk of his being able
to pick up a single word, owing to the clamor
kicked up by motor exhaust and propeller.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re going on a bit further than was arranged,”
said Jack, concisely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! meanin’ we don’t pull up when we
strike the border, eh, what, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just that, brother—the going is good, and
we might as well keep moving till we drop down
on the Metropolitan Airport grounds.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whoopee! you mean at Los Angeles, don’t
you, old hoss?” demanded Perk, apparently considerably
surprised by his pal’s bald statement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Righto, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How come, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get this fixed in your noodle,” said the resting
chief pilot—“circumstances often alter cases,
they tell us; well, when we figured on halting at
or near the border, close to the Gila River,
things hadn’t happened such as have hit us since
then.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Meanin’ the storm, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was one thing,” admitted the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Knockin’ us out o’ our reckonin’, like, an’
makin’ us take a forced landin’ on the open
prairie where we run across that flimsy ol’ shack—does
that cover what you mean, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“After a fashion it does,” the other told him,
adding: “like the play of Hamlet, with Hamlet
left out, it falls flat. You omitted the chief reason
for my making this change in plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess you must mean Simeon here, eh
boy?” asked Perk, as if suddenly waking up to
the fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing—what are we going to do with
<i>him</i>, tell me, Perk? It’d be impossible for us
to lug him everywhere we mean to go, flying
across into Mexico, and baiting the wolf in his
own lair, as you might say. He’d be a constant
hindrance to our being free to act besides, we’d
run a fat chance of having him give us away,
just when we thought it was all over but the
shouting.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, Jack—it means you don’t trust his
promises to lend us a helpin’ hand, and goin’
back on his pals—ain’t that the idea?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it,” replied Jack, never bothering
to drop his voice a particle, knowing as he did
that without the aid of those valuable ear-phones
Simeon, humped up against the side of Perk,
could not have caught what was said even
though it had been shouted at the top of his
voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what then, partner?” continued Perk,
apparently still groping in the dark.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing to hinder our tripping right along
till we fetch up at Angeles, when we can find a
way to hand him over to the Federal agents located
there. He’s connected with the big gang
against which Uncle Sam’s declared war to the
knife; and as a material witness, ready to turn
State’s evidence, they’ll be only too well pleased
to hold him <i>incommunicado</i>, so he can’t do a
thing to warn the bunch the big push is on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Okay, Jack. Sounds mighty good to me,
you bet. I’d never a cudgeled my brains enough
to hatch up an idea like that; takes you to think
o’ clever dodges, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then we’ll consider it settled, eh, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just what we will,” came the confident reply.
“’Bout when ought we raise the last beacon
on the road to Angeles, an’ lamp the field
lights at that same Metropolitan Airport?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! if everything goes well, you might call
it along toward midnight,” Jack assured him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got aplenty o’ gas to carry on that far, I’d
guess?” hazarded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s to be hoped so,” said Jack; “because
there’s some mighty tough stretches of country
between the Colorado and the big Pacific city.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! so I understand, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And it would be a bad job for us if we had
to hit the ground where you couldn’t scrape up
a decent landing place with a fine-tooth comb.
When I take the stick again, Perk, maybe you’d
better have a look in, so’s to get tabs on our fuel
tank, and tell me how it stands. From the dial
finger yonder I figure we’ll have a lot more than
enough to see us through.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s right, boss,” affirmed Perk, after casting
a hasty glance at the tell-tale figures so
plainly marked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That settles it then,” with which remark
Jack showed by his actions that further conversation
was needless.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Simeon sat there through it all, never
once dreaming how his fate was being so calmly
settled; doubtless he imagined the consultation
had been about something connected with the
running of the cloud-chaser, and covered facts
such as would have been all Greek to him, even
had he been able to listen in.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was not at all bothered by this change
of plans on the part of the head pilot—it mattered
little when they managed to drop down at
the airport—chances were the ground lights
were kept on full through the whole of each
night, since air mail planes would be apt to
come and go, some of them having been thrown
out of their regular schedules by dense mountain
fogs, or head winds that cut down the customary
speed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, also, was well acquainted with the
courtesy to be encountered at all such well conducted
flying fields, where every one would be
eager to do whatever was possible for the comfort
of those who chose to visit such ports, and
show little or no undo curiosity connected with
the reason for their coming.</p>

<p class='c013'>True, they might turn out to be a bit short
with the “eats;” but Perk, who knew the ways
of his pal so well, felt certain Jack would see to
it they had a chance to “fill up” as soon as they
could strike an open restaurant, of which there
should be no lack in such a wide-open city as
Los Angeles, with its sporty crowds at Hollywood.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was moving on apace, and
there cropped up fresh thrilling sights every little
while, for Perk to stare at through his useful
glasses. They were following the course of
the famous Gila River toward its confluence
with the still better known Colorado, which
hundreds of miles further north passed through
the Grand Canyon country, most majestic in a
panorama sense of any region on the face of the
globe.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along about nightfall they might expect to
pass over Yuma, located close to the junction of
the two rivers. Perk wondered once or twice
why his pal had not decided to land there, and
turn the prisoner over to some one in authority;
but he felt certain Jack had good reasons for
not attempting this.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe, now,” Perk told himself, with Jack
again running the ship, while he attended to
some of his own manifold duties; “he
guessed there might be a bad crowd at Yuma—fellers
apt to be in cahoots with the same
gang o’ daredevils Simeon here was connected
with; and who might even try to effect his escape,
so as to shut his trap—even go so far as to
knife the poor skunk to make sure he didn’t
peach. Oh! yeah, that’s the way Jack looked
at it, bet your boots it must be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Soon afterwards the sun gave notice that it
was about to withdraw behind the line of mountains
lying toward the west. Jack had his bearings,
and expected to be able to pick up the flash
beacons arranged for the convenience of the air
mail corps in their night flights to and from Los
Angeles. So thoroughly has this all been
mapped out, with the signals to be found about
every ten miles, that a pilot can see as many as
three ahead at one time, depending on the altitude
at which he may be flying.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such wise precautions had been taken that
would make night flying just as safe and easy as
during the daytime one thing only cropping up
from time to time to raise trouble, and cause delay
was the presence of the fogs that were apt
to rise from the deep canyons, to blot out those
friendly gleams of flashing light marking the
air mail course from start to finish.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch24' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIV <br /> <br />SIMEON GROWS DESPERATE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was commencing to grow dusk when they
sighted the lights of Yuma, that town on the railroad
leading to Los Angeles. Such a thing as a
plane flying overhead was so common these modern
days as to hardly excite any comment—they
came and went, with seldom anything out of the
usual taking place although not so very far
away, among the mountains, one of the most
dreadful of all air tragedies known to the annals
of flying had taken place, when the great
liner <i>City of San Francisco</i>, lost in a storm,
struck head-on against a rocky cliff, shattering
the ship and causing the death of every one of
those aboard, some seven souls in all.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now they had left Yuma far in their rear, and
Jack was watching to pick up the first flash beacon
on the way to the Coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>The weather continued to favor them, the
heavens being almost devoid of any semblance of
clouds, and the air quite cool at the height they
maintained while heading into the beckoning
west.</p>

<p class='c013'>Over deserts and mountainous stretches they
kept swinging along, to the constant accompaniment
of the customary chorus of a bustling plane
threading the mighty air lanes of the skies. The
silvery stars came out in battalions to sprinkle
the azure heavens like innumerable bright lanterns,
such as could be seen in Old Japan during
carnival times.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was the life, Perk told himself again and
again, sitting there after he had munched his
scanty portion of their meagre supper, Simeon
having again declined to share with them—what
air pilot who has tasted of the joys of such hours
could ever dream of forsaking his vocation, so
long as Fortune allowed him to retain his vision,
hearing, and the faculty for guiding an onrushing
ship through the realms of unlimited space—not
he for one, Perk assured himself, drawing in
huge draughts of the clear air, and watching the
wonderful beacons as they passed them by,
threading the pathway of the stars as it were,
straight toward their distant goal.</p>

<p class='c013'>The night wore on, with the voyagers making
splendid progress.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had made no miscalculation when saying
he believed they would fetch up at their destination
somewhere about the midnight hour; for
it still lacked more or less of that time when in
the near distance they glimpsed lights telling
that the city, and its nearby aviation field, must
be close at hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they found themselves circling over the
port, which, just as Jack had fancied would be
the case, was lighted most brilliantly. Even as
they sighted the field they noted a ship settling
down, evidently an air mail plane that had
been held up by some dense fog belt which they
had fortunately missed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Soft snap I’d call it, droppin’ down with all
them field lights to show the ground, so a feller
c’n see a rock the size o’ a baseball,” was what
the tickled Perk was telling himself while Jack
was proceeding to make the terminal drop, with
several ground attendants hurrying up so as to
lend any assistance needed.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had received his instructions from Jack,
and removed the handcuffs from the wrists of
the prisoner. There was no necessity for letting
everybody know the facts and the sight of a
man wearing steel bracelets, and gripped by an
attendant never fails to excite keen curiosity with
most people and especially would this be the
case if he had just come by the air route from
some unknown and therefore mysterious quarter.</p>

<p class='c013'>He would keep his arm through that of
Simeon, and inform him in a forcible whisper
that should he attempt any “funny business” it
would be at the risk of being shot down without
further warning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack would attend to everything necessary,
such as having their crate stowed away in some
convenient hangar, where it could be recovered
at any time, by paying such charges as were
customary.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be sure Perk was questioned by several of
the men while Jack saw that the ship was being
taken care of but when he chose, Perk could keep
a still tongue in his head and since he paid no
attention to what was said, and never opened his
mouth in the least, possibly they concluded he
must be both deaf and dumb.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk may have chuckled deep down in his
throat when he heard a few of the disgusted
remarks some of the men exchanged concerning
his lack of speech and hearing but
he kept his own counsel; and in the end Jack
came up saying he had secured a taxi to carry
them to a small hotel down in the heart of the
city, recommended by one of the hostlers who
seemed to know what he was talking about.</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon had looked a bit anxious, as though
wondering how their arrival at Los Angeles
would affect his wretched fortunes but he made
no attempt to appeal to the crowd for help.
Undoubtedly he was firmly convinced that the
grim Perk must be a man of his word, and that
any attempt on his part to break away would
prove a most serious matter indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah!” Perk was telling himself under his
breath when he took note of this humble disposition
on the part of Simeon, “Guess now he feels
it’s a heap better to be a live fool than a dead
hero; an’ by jinks I don’t blame the beggar for
thinkin’ thataways either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon all three safely lodged in the
taxi—which fortunately had remained up to this
late hour, the driver hoping to pick up a fare—and
heading for the nearby city.</p>

<p class='c013'>Later on they entered the small hotel, and
found it all the obliging ground attache at the
port had said. Jack registered the party, all of
them under fictitious names, since it paid to exercise
due caution when on the track of big game
just as it would for the big game hunter to make
no sound when advancing upon an enormous
tusker or “rogue” elephant whose spoor he had
been trailing through forest and jungle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Would it be possible for us to have some
supper sent up to our room?” Jack asked the
night clerk who shrugged his shoulders as if
dubious concerning his ability to accommodate
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kindly try to have it done, if double price
will have any effect,” continued Jack, using his
most gracious smile that usually accomplished
his purpose and at that the clerk responded by
saying he would do his best but it was of course
most unusual, and he hoped they would not make
any complaint if the variety was not all they
might wish.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quantity is the chief thing that interests
us,” said Jack; “you see, we have come
by air, and fell short of food while on our way,
so that my two pals here are very near being
starved; so whatever you send make it a fairly
bountiful spread, please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they were shown to their room, which
contained a double bed and a cot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I kinder guess now, partner,” said Perk, after
flashing a glance around the apartment, fronting
on a back lot, though up in the third story of the
building, “you an’ me better share the bed, while
Simeon gets his little nap on the sofy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That goes, Perk,” his comrade told him
“and after we’ve had supper we’ll hit the hay.
After such a broken night as we had back a ways
some sleep ought to be welcome, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! hope we don’t have to wait too tarnel
long for the grub,” Perk was saying, dismally
rubbing his stomach, as if to show how flat it
seemed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack engaged him in conversation of a general
character, just to keep his mind from dwelling
on the subject of eating for once Perk let himself
believe he was in danger of famishing and
he just could not subside but must commence
to marshal all the known dishes of which he was
especially fond, and keep on taunting and tantalizing
himself by stringing them off as might a
glib-tongued waiter in any restaurant.</p>

<p class='c013'>After quite a tiresome wait there was a knock
at the door, which Perk hastened to answer.
Two waiters strode in, bearing trays laden
with a pretty substantial assortment of food—quite
a satisfactory display, Jack thought, considering
the late hour, and that probably the regular
kitchen force must have long ago turned in
or else gone home.</p>

<p class='c013'>The table fairly groaned under the assortment—Perk
pertinently mentioned the fact,
adding that he guessed he’d do his share of
groaning <i>after</i> he had finished his supper which
Jack did not doubt in the least, having a knowledge
concerning the other’s vast appetite, and
unbridled disposition to make a pig of himself
at such times when food was plentiful.</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon Hawkins was coaxed to sit down with
them and as his state of mind seemed to have
improved quite a little, he also partook of food
of which he most certainly was much in need,
having fasted so long and abstemiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>When this ceremony had been carried through
to a finish, the supply of visible victuals had been
wonderfully reduced; and even Perk was heard
to declare he could not eat another bite, which
meant he was like a stuffed turkey, fit for the
Thanksgiving table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before turning in, Perk took occasion to “talk
like a Dutch uncle,” as he termed it, to Simeon,
assuring him he need not be in too upset a state
of mind concerning his future, since Jack had
said he was bound to do all he could to have him
let go, because of what he had confided to them,
and such assistance he would be able to lend the
Government in convicting the head men of the
lawless conspiracy along the counterfeiting line.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other nodded his head as though he
understood that, having embarked in the game
of throwing down Slippery Slim, he realized
there was nothing else for him to do but go
through to the windup.</p>

<p class='c013'>So confiding Perk, thinking things would run
smoothly, took off some of his outer garments,
and rolled into bed, as it afterwards turned out,
happily choosing that side of the same nearest
to the windows of their room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack soon followed, and the last thing he noticed
ere snapping off the light was the humbled
Simeon wrapped in a blanket, and lying there
flat on his back, as though meaning to get what
sleep he could during that fragment of the night
still remaining.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was, so far as appearances went, sound
asleep; but then sometimes things are not just
what they seem. To tell the truth, Perk had
made up his mind ere lying down that he would
“sleep with one eye open,” as he called it, meaning
it was his intention to keep on the alert, ready
to jump out of bed at the least sign of trouble.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps when he thus decided it was with a
hazy idea they might have some sort of unwelcome
visitor during the night; he could not just
decide how this could be but then those unprincipled
agents of the counterfeiter king—like
the fellow who had rifled the belongings of
Scotty, the air mail pilot in Atlanta—were liable
to turn up anywhere, everywhere, when least expected,
and try to manipulate their bold games.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hearing some sort of sound as of a person
moving, Perk suddenly sat straight up in bed,
to see their prisoner in the act of crawling over
the sill of the nearby window, evidently bent on
giving them the slip!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch25' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXV <br /> <br />THE STAGE SET FOR BATTLE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Hey! you, lay off that stuff!” was the way
Perk exploded, even as he made a wild dash
across the floor, and clutched the reckless Simeon
by the arm, dragging him back into the room
by sheer strength.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other struggled but feebly perhaps he
was really horrified at the desperate chances he
had been about to take.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, you must be goofy, Hawkins, to try that
sort o’ game!” Perk went on scornfully,
as the wretched man writhed on the floor where
he had flung him. “Don’t you know it’s two
stories down to the roof o’ that extension; an’
chances are you’d a got a broken neck, or leg,
in the drop. Better make up your mind to take
the medicine an’ stand it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack of course had been aroused at the first
movement of his chum, and sat up in bed watching
the actions of the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Trying to take leg bail, was he, Perk?” he
remarked. “You can hardly blame the poor
dick, come to think of it because he’s rubbing
up against a tough proposition. Better put the
bracelets on him again, and tie his ankles together
he might get loco, and try to jump out
of a window, just to end it all and that would
be too bad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon, utterly cowed and silent, made no resistance
when Perk followed out his pal’s advice.
There were several hours of the night still remaining,
and they might as well secure such
sleep as lay in their power, since no one could
predict what sort of strenuous activity awaited
them in the near future.</p>

<p class='c013'>Came morning, and the two air detectives
were stirring.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another right fine mornin’ for us,” Perk remarked,
blithely, as he looked out of the window,
and made a grimace at seeing what a nasty
drop had awaited the desperate prisoner had he
succeeded in carrying out his plan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! that’s the usual program, I understand,
out here on the Coast,” Jack told him. “Hardly
ever see any rain in this blessed country; that’s
why they have to depend on irrigation for their
crops.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Plenty to keep us hoppin’ today, I kinder
guess, partner, eh, what?” volunteered Perk, as
he started dressing, after removing the stout
cords that had been wrapped about the lower
limbs of the Federal prisoner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never said truer words, boy,” Jack
added “got to settle about this business of having
our friend here held until the gate’s been
crashed, and our scoop put through. Then I
mean to have a good talk with several people in
the Government offices, who can give us a few
points that so far we’ve been missing. You can’t
pick up too much information when aiming to
stack up against smart lads like this Slippery
Slim. He’s got so many eyes on the watch the
chap who expects to corral <i>him</i> must get up right
early in the morning, and pull the wires in a
dozen different directions. I’d a heap rather
overdo the matter of taking precautions than to
let just one ragged end get loose, for a game like
this is only as strong as its weakest link.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do we eat here, or look up a restaurant?”
asked Perk, quite naturally, since it was the
easiest thing in the world for his thoughts to
turn toward the subject of catering to the loud
demands of his stomach, when the usual time
for meals came around.</p>

<p class='c013'>“On the whole I reckon it’d be as well for us
to stick around, and have breakfast fetched up
here,” suggested jack. “I’ll step down presently,
and see if it can be managed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just as you say, partner,” Perk told him,
grinning, to add: “Make her two fried eggs and
a rasher o’ bacon for me; also a big cup o’ coffee
with a stack o’ wheats done brown. Say, you
might add some toast, and an orange, seein’ that
this is California, an’ a feller ought to patronize
the fruit industry when happenin’ to visit the
Coast country. Guess that ought to fill a vacuum
okay, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Leave it to me, Perk, and you’ll never starve
to death I’m a good provider, and Uncle Sam
foots the chuck wagon bill.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When later on two waiters appeared laden
down with a mass of dishes, Perk grinned some
more, and looked quite joyous; for the odor of
coffee and bacon always pleased his sense of smell
as nothing else could.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Simeon had apparently about decided to
make the best of a bad bargain, for he began
sniffing as though the idea of breakfast appealed
to him—he certainly needed something to brace
him up.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along about ten o’clock they prepared to set
out for the offices of the Federal forces in Los
Angeles. Simeon had finally given his word not
to make any further attempt at escape. Jack had
been talking seriously with the fellow ever since
breakfast, trying to squeeze further information
from him, and holding out hope that if he “came
clean” he might yet be allowed to go back to his
family after the Government had made use of
him to send the leaders in the wide flung conspiracy
to prison for long terms.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again a convenient taxi was called upon to
convey the trio to their intended destination.
Both Jack and Perk evinced considerable curiosity
concerning the unfamiliar sights on the
streets. They asked numerous questions of the
driver, who chanced to be a communicative sort
of fellow, and filled them up with information
about the sunny queen city of the Coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not long before Jack’s magical passport,
sanctioned by the Big Boss at Washington,
brought them in contact with several high officials
who apparently had been secretly apprized
of their presence in the West, and had
also been requested to afford the two daring sky
detectives all the assistance possible in carrying
out their plan of campaign.</p>

<p class='c013'>So it came about that Simeon was taken off
their hands, after the story of his capture had
been told. Jack secured a promise that the man
would be lightly dealt with because of the valuable
aid he had already afforded the sleuth-hounds
of the air branch of the Law.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both of them shook hands with the pitiful
looking chap as he was taken away by a marshal
who had been summoned and who would see
that he was kept aloof from all other prisoners
until his testimony was wanted in court.</p>

<p class='c013'>After that they fell into a general talk, Jack
telling the deeply interested officials about the
stirring adventures befalling himself and Perk
since they first struck Atlanta, where the drive
really had its beginning.</p>

<p class='c013'>In return he was given such information as
had been gathered in connection with more recent
happenings along the line of Slippery Slim’s
operations and the fact of the matter was there
always seemed to be fresh outbreaks of the bogus
money disease in this or that part of the whole
Southwest, as new agents started to work virgin
territory until by this time the greatest unrest
and uneasiness existed among all Government
ranks.</p>

<p class='c013'>The balance of that day the two pals put in
taking a look around the city, visiting Hollywood,
and seeing a number of movie stars whom
they recognized from familiarity with their faces
on the silver screen at various times.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack paid another visit to Federal Headquarters
on the succeeding day, to gather up all
loose ends, and decide on his plans while Perk
took himself off to look up some old friend, who,
he understood, was making good in one of the
new big pictures.</p>

<p class='c013'>They met again late in the afternoon, with
Perk displaying signs of nervous tension for
almost the first thing he said to his chum was in
the shape of a leading question, which Jack undoubtedly
anticipated, knowing Perk’s headlong
nature as he did, and the habit of the other for
seeking speedy action.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wal, what’s the good word, old hoss—when
do we skip out from here, if so be it’s all set?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No more hanging fire, brother,” Jack assured
him, smilingly “we’re loaded for bear this time,
sure pop. I’ve been out at the airport, and had
a full tank of gas put aboard the crate as well
as all that stuff you sent over so’s to keep us from,
starving to death.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bully boy!” crowed the delighted Perk; “jest
can’t come any too soon to please me. I’m only
cravin’ a chanct for a set-to with the head o’ this
flim-flam bunch, who’s laughed at the Government
boys just once too often. Is it tonight,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Midnight ought to see us several hundred
miles on our way, if all goes well,” Jack told
him, not displaying any outward signs of jubilation
himself, although he undoubtedly must be
thrilled by the thought of how they were now
about to put everything to the test, and match
their wits against that astute schemer, for whom
the Federal prison doors were yawning so widely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never gimme sweeter words, old pal!”
Perk was saying, backed up by one of his most
hideous grins.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch26' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVI <br /> <br />ON THE FACE OF THE MOON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Jack proved as good as his word, for they were
off shortly after nightfall, and headed almost
due east. No one at the aviation field had the
remotest idea as to who they were, what their
destination might be, and whence they came.
But then this particular port was becoming a
very important link in the trans-continental
chain, with lines of great passenger and freight
airships going and coming not to mention the
several speedy air mail boats that covered their
hundreds of miles day or night and as a rule on a
schedule that seemed as perfect as that of any
train time table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was unusually silent, at least for him.
Perhaps he was realizing at last the serious
nature of the job they had undertaken—that it
was rather a weighty proposition, such as was
bound to require all their united reserve force
to put across.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still, he had absolute confidence in Jack’s
ability to swing the undertaking, and also refused
to allow anything like doubt to assail him
with regard to their united courage.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was by this time well understood that the
climax, when it came, would occur on Mexican
soil for now that all accounts from every quarter
were in hand, they knew absolutely that the den
of the counterfeiting gang was in a secret cave
among the mountains of Sonora also that the
sagacious Slim had bought protection from certain
local Mexican officials, who were suspected
of secretly plotting a new revolution, and took
this means for obtaining the money needed to
purchase arms in the States.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was even said that Slim never flew back to
his headquarters without loading his swift plane
with a dead weight of guns and ammunition as
the price he had to pay for being allowed to operate
undisturbed on foreign soil.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A pretty kettle of fish, I’d call that sort o’
game,” Perk had indignantly asserted, when he
learned of this see-saw method of currying favor
with the plotting generals who hoped to once
again turn the country upside-down and kick
the present rulers out of office, as well as seize
the city banks with their rich booty.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so it was, but Jack realized how it accounted
for the long spell of immunity Slim had
enjoyed while he lined his pockets, and spread
that financial panic throughout the Southwestern
States. There never had been his equal as a skillful
worker and bold lawbreaker; one who knew
how to set neighbor against neighbor, and make
every one work so that he could rake off a heavy
dividend from each separate deal.</p>

<p class='c013'>So he had for a long time been coming and
going, crossing the border, as a rule by the air
route, carrying his cargoes of deceitful bank bills
to various distributing points—like the one Jack
and Perk had struck by sheer accident—gathering
the genuine stuff contributed by his numerous
dupes, and leaving bulky packages of the wonderfully
executed spurious notes in exchange.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a veritable Golconda for the industrious
worker, who, safe from interference, had kept
as busy as the proverbial bee, that stores honey
day after day.</p>

<p class='c013'>They followed the line of swirling beacons
the air mail boys were in the habit of trailing,
since by this means they could pass some of the
numerous danger spots on their route. In good
time Jack expected to turn his back on these
friendly flashing lights and head due south, to
cross the border, and fly over foreign territory.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had been placed in possession of certain
secret documents issued by the Mexican government,
which proved how they knew of the unholy
alliance made between Slim, the counterfeiter
king, and those traitorous generals who yearned
for fresh outbreaks so as to pamper their own
personal fortunes, just then at low ebb.</p>

<p class='c013'>There existed something of an arrangement,
whereby the Mexican government agreed to
stand back of any effort made by the Department
at Washington to capture Slim, smash his gang
that was widening its powers every day, and
clean out the mess of near-bandits with whom he
had allied himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>If it were necessary all arrangements had been
made whereby Colonel Jose Morales, with a
crack regiment of hard fighting regulars who
had seen much bloody service in bringing the
defiant Yaqui Indians to terms by invading their
mountain fastnesses, and meeting them hand-to-hand—was
stationed within a day’s ride of the
ravine where Slim had his plant and could be
summoned by means of certain smoke signals.
No sooner would these “talking smokes” be detected
than the order would be given “boots and
saddles,” with the mounted regiment in full
swing for the debatable ground where Slim had
his nefarious nest.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, too, had a secret arrangement been effected
with the old leader of the now defunct Texas
Rangers, most of whom were in the service of the
Government connected with the border patrol
and orders had been given the former gallant
hero that if a certain message were received, no
matter by what method, he was to gather a squad
of his old fighters, and cross the border, sure of
being warmly received by the loyal Mexican
troops who would welcome his assistance in wiping
out the sore spot that had been so long a blot
on their country’s honor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus it would seem that everything possible
had been done toward striking a telling blow.
It only remained for Jack Ralston to start the
ball rolling, when it must gain fresh impetus
with every revolution.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk acted as though decidedly pleased when
later on he discovered that they no longer followed
the flashing beacon trail—Jack had gone
as far as was judicious along that line and now
headed straight into the mysterious south, toward
the border of the neighboring republic where
disorder still held sway, and disgruntled chiefs
continued to plot against the rule of the recently
elected president.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every mile traversed now was bringing them
closer to their goal, and Perk found more or less
joy in picturing the thrilling climax, when they
would give Slippery Slim the surprise of his
life—if only no leak concerning their clever plan
had come about.</p>

<p class='c013'>The moon had risen, and was hanging there
in the east, a silvery shield with one edge clipped
off telling that the queen of the night was already
well past her “full” stage and running for
a fall.</p>

<p class='c013'>All at once Perk had an electric shock.</p>

<p class='c013'>He leaned convulsively forward and gripped
his mate by the shoulder, at the same time pointing
toward the southeast and shouting through
the head phones:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look, oh look—see what’s passing across the
moon, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then just as suddenly did he release his clutch,
to fall back in his seat, and exclaim most dramatically,
with a touch of disgust in his voice:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! It’s slipped past, dang the luck!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But I got it all right, Perk,” the pilot assured
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it <i>was</i> a ship, an’ my lamps didn’t fool
me, partner?” Perk cried in renewed excitement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As sure as you’re born, that’s what it was,
brother,” Jack added.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Headin’ south, same as we’re doin’ right now,
eh, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, buddy—just what the crate was
doing, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the answer—could it a been <i>him</i>, on
his way back home with a load o’ machine guns,
life they say he carries every time he crosses the
border, after takin’ out a freshly printed batch
o’ his flimsy stuff to soak on the honest folks back
home?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s something we can only make a stab
at,” replied Jack. “Chances lean that, way, I
must say; but just the same it might have been
some mail plane that’s got blown off its regular
course, and is beating it for the home port. Then
again I understand the border patrol are handling
a few ships in their line of intercepting flyers
making a business of smuggling Chinese aliens
across the line night-times.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d give a heap to know the answer to that
puzzle,” continued Perk, who disliked enigmas,
and all that sort of thing calculated to make a
fellow lie awake nights, bothering his poor
brains. He never had been fitted by Nature for
the job of being a real detective.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll never know,” his pal told him, “unless
it happens we run afoul of the other crate when
our courses draw closer together and if it’s Slim
whose fingers grip that stick we’d rather be excused
for having that happen—our job is to fetch
him back <i>alive</i>, and not make him lose his life
in a crash.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me, I ain’t peticular just what <i>does</i> happen
to the slick guy,” Perk wound up the little talkfest
by saying. “Only, when it comes to a real
showdown either Slim or us got to go to the
wall—dead or alive, the thing’s goin’ to be settled
for keeps!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch27' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVII <br /> <br />THE SIERRA MADRE CHAIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Another thing Perk noticed—this was the fact
that Jack seemed to have changed his mind with
regard to making haste for the ship was racing
along at top-notch speed, as though engaged
in a race with some unseen rival.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hey! what’s the big idea, Jack?” he called
out, when this thing had been going on for some
time, and his burning curiosity could no longer
be held in leash. “Why doin’ the sprintin’ act,
I’m awonderin’?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Less chance for us to run foul of that other
boat if we forge well ahead, don’t you see, partner?”
exclaimed the pilot, sententiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! that’s a fact,” returned the enlightened
Perk. “An’ then mebbe it’d be jest as well for us
to get there ahead o’ the boss in the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m aiming to do that,” he was told.
“It happens that we can’t keep on in the boat till
we strike close to his hideout—the racket would
stir the whole bunch up like a hornet’s nest you’ve
kicked when going through the brush, with the
mad critters swarming out to tackle you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you now, Big Boss—never did think
o’ that before. Then I kinder guess we’ll
have to hike some little way,” and there was a
vein of chagrin in the speaker’s voice as he mentioned
this fact, since walking and Perk never
did seem to agree very well—like most flyers he
had been spoiled for all manner of pedestrianism
by his ability to cover such vast distances
without moving his pedal extremities an iota.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s our sure enough program,” Jack told
him, doubtless thinking that the delayed knowledge
might allow his pal to make up his mind
about swallowing the bitter medicine without a
single grimace.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not long after this little break when
Jack again spoke:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve a good idea we’re across the line now,
partner,” was the information he passed along.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sounds good to me, okay,” commented Perk,
with a tinge of solid satisfaction visible in his
voice as though having a possible rough-house
job to handle, the sooner he got busy the sooner
it was likely to be over.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And making more than an even hundred
miles to the hour in the bargain, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some punkins about comin’ in swell on the
last lap, this crate sure is, I’d say, partner.
Licketty split she humps along like a reg’lar
witch. I guess now she’d make rings around
that ol’ boat Slim’s got hold o’ though it
answers his purpose seems like. But see here,
Jack, you never did tell me jest how you got word
to that same Colonel Morales down here in
Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was given my instructions, and sent a telegram
to him at Hermosilla, in care of Padre
Lopez, giving him the order he was expecting—during
the last hour we were in Los Angeles.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! then the sojers must be in the saddle
right now!” burst out Perk, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If the arrangement went through without a
miss that’s like enough a fact,” admitted Jack;
“the way my plan’s arranged everything must go
off with the regularity of machine work, each
separate part dovetailing, so as to work in full
sympathy. If anything lags, and goes amiss, it’s
apt to throw the whole scheme out of gear, you
understand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! I grab what you mean, partner,” said
the astounded Perk; “but I got to hand it to you
when it comes to hatchin’ up big things—it’s jest
wonderful how you manage. An’ I sure do hope
everything’ll slide along like greased lightnin’,
once it gets started.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had planned to drop down in some isolated
spot where with the coming of dawn, with
the aid of the strong glasses they could pick up
the rocky Sierra Madre range with its canyons
and valleys, where, unless all his leads have been
false clues, those whom they sought would have
their secret den and stronghold.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk got to thinking these matters over, and of
course he was bound to run across some things
that still seemed a bit hazy in his mind. Accordingly
he sought for information at headquarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, now, d’ye know I’m jest beginnin’ to get
on to why you had the wings an’ fuselage o’ this
here ship painted the color o’ sand—took a pattern
from the way they striped the steamers on
the Atlantic durin’ the big war, an’ colored batteries
on the battle front, so flyers couldn’t pick
’em out to drop their bombs down on—camouflage,
ain’t that the right word, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Slow to get on to my little schemes, partner;
but in the end you make a smart stab—yes, that
was what I had in mind, for I knew we’d have
to park the old bus somewhere in the open; and
I didn’t want any hostile eye to glimpse her from
a soaring plane, or a mountain crag—for you see
I reckoned Slim was too smart a lad not to have
binoculars handy so as to watch for trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>More than ever was Perk impressed with an
overwhelming admiration for the ability of his
pal to lay plans capable of covering every possible
necessity that could arise in carrying out
the job they had tackled.</p>

<p class='c013'>He asked no more questions, confident that
everything was bound to move along smoothly,
when the casting of the play was in such capable
hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Anyway,” he told himself as he thus pondered,
“we ain’t seen anything more o’ that moon
ship, which makes it certain we’ve knocked her
outen the runnin’. Wonder now if that was really
an’ truly ol’ Slim, totin’ a swell bunch o’ machine
guns, so’s to bolster up the new revolution
they say is bein’ fostered an’ nursed in this corner
o’ poor ol’ Mexico. Queer what international
jingles a feller c’n get mixed up in, when he runs
in harness with Uncle Sam’s revenue boys; but
it’s all pie to me, just the same, ’cause they allers
did say my middle name was Scrap.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was now starting to make use of the binoculars,
which were fitted with lens capable of
making them useful during the night-time, at
least when there was a certain amount of moonlight.
In a general way Perk could decide where
to turn his attention, for it went without saying
that the mountain chain lay toward the southeast
for had he not studied the lay of the land
upon the small but accurate map with which
Jack had armed himself before leaving Washington
to take up this hazardous adventure?</p>

<p class='c013'>When he felt assured that he could make out
the distant ridges he announced his pleasing discovery
to his mate and then at the other’s request
took over the controls so that Jack in turn might
use the glasses and thus make assurance doubly
safe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bank, and head more into the east,” Perk
heard the other saying, after a steady look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it’s the Sierra Madre okay, partner, I
opine?” suggested the one at the stick, as he
obeyed orders.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question about it,” Jack assured him “but
I knew it was time for us to sight the ridge. I’ve
pored over the map of this section, and charted
it all out in blocks, so I can tell just what the lay
of the land is, and how long it’s apt to take the
colonel to get here with his galloping company.
We’re going to drop down presently, and find
shelter where we can lie low until the hour comes
for making our ten strike.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How long might that be, boss?” asked Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It all depends on certain happenings. We
can creep up close to the place, and watch how
things move figuring out how to act when you
get your first glimpse of a dust cloud away off
toward where Hermosilla lies. I give the cavalry
two days to reach here, if everything moves along
smoothly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Two long days—an’ say, we gotter eat all that
time, don’t we, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We surely can’t live on air, Perk; but I’ve
provided for that—even should we run out of
grub you laid in I’ve a little deposit of dried
meat, real pemmican in fact, that will keep us
from famishing. Water we can secure somewhere
among the mountain trails, since never a
drop would we be apt to find on the open desert.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! I’m leavin’ it all to you, Big Boss,”
Perk told him, again lost in wonder and near
awe as he realized how Jack seemed to have
thought of everything—what a mind the boy had
for grasping details, and weaving them into the
net with which they expected to enmesh the slippery
one.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now Jack slowed down their speed more or
less, although of course it was not possible to
soften the clamor accompanying their flight
through space. But Perk noticed that, so far as
he could tell, the night wind was coming from
ahead, and this assured him it would not be apt
to carry those telltale sounds toward the range
lying in the east, and so warn the enemy of their
coming.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch28' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVIII <br /> <br />CLOSE TO THE TIGER’S LAIR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“We’re about due for a landing, Perk,” finally
announced the pilot, after he had used the glasses
for a spell, and again took over the stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! some hike that’s agoin’ to be, I’d say,
old hoss,” grunted Perk; “but I guess it can’t
be helped—got to take the bitter with the sweet
lots o’ times—the way o’ the world, seems like.
Go to it then, boss; if anybody c’n make a safe
landin’ by moonlight it’s jest you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>His confidence was not misplaced, as Jack
proved when he brought the ship down in as
perfect a three-point drop as the best of aces
could have carried out.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’ll have to lie here till we need her again,”
he observed, on climbing out of his confined
quarters, and stretching his cramped legs after
the manner of air mail pilots in from a long and
irksome run.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk stared around him—they were on the
sandy desert without a doubt, and off toward the
east could be seen the dim crests of the high and
ragged peaks comprising the main ridges of the
Sierra Madres—old-time home of the fierce
Yaqui Indians, whom the soldiers of Mexico had
for so many years labored so hard and in vain
to conquer; nor was it until the day the airplane
came along that they were able to accomplish
this much to be desired end.</p>

<p class='c013'>But now other equally annoying thorns in the
flesh had made a hideout of those same
inaccessible mountains—defeated aspirants for
the presidency of the Republic, always generals,
took to gathering groups of malcontents and mercenary
adventurers in these mountain depths,
defying the troops sent to rout them out, and
proving the latest source of trouble in the political
problems of the authorities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack soon completed his preparations for
abandoning their ship. He looked it all over, to
satisfy himself its camouflage would prevent it
from being sighted by any air pilot chancing to
pass overhead at a reasonable altitude then he
gathered a few articles, the possession of which
might turn out to be of value when it came to
closing the mouth of the bag and finally announced
himself as ready to make a move.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got all you wanted, Perk?” he inquired, incidentally,
for he had reason to feel certain such
was the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! from the binoculars an’ my rifle, down
to what’s left o’ the eats,” the other assured him.
“Guess we’ll get along somehow or other.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! don’t bother your head about the grub
part, comrade; I’m carrying a small packet with
me that holds enough to keep two men alive for
a whole week—all we’ll have to do is to run
across some sort of spring, where we can get all
the drinking water we’ll need, while we wait for
the wagon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! in this case you’re meanin’ a <i>hearse</i>,
’cause mebbe we’ll have to shoot him up afore he
calls quits,” and Perk grinned horribly at his
own wit.</p>

<p class='c013'>So they left the ship stranded there, sprawled
out like a gigantic dragon-fly or a monstrous
toad. If Fortune proved kind they might yet
live to make good use of it again when the time
came to fly back to God’s country on the other
side of the border where defeated candidates
are in the habit of accepting the dictum of the
voters, and retiring from the field of battle await
the next call to arms, with ballots instead of
bullets as their method of settling elections.</p>

<p class='c013'>Side by side they set forth, like a pair of adventurers
starting out in search of Fortune’s
smiles, and careless alike as to whether they met
with success or not, so long as the excitement
they craved came their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk managed to conceal the chagrin with
which he buckled down to his unwelcome task,
walking always gave him a pain, mental rather
than physical but on the whole he was a good
scout, and could follow the beckoning finger of
duty, even though he loathed the conditions attached
to the performance of his role.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sand was far from compact, and allowed
them to sink in somewhat, so this made the going
more difficult in contrast to that on the seashore
which being beaten down by incoming waves is
often as hard as concrete and a pleasure to walk
over; whereas this of the desert was dry and
sifted at the least puff of wind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk having had some previous experience
with deserts, felt no love for the uninviting waste
places of the earth only such useless vegetation
as sage, greasewood, cactus and yucca would
grow between the sand dunes amidst the blistering
fangs of the infernal heat and always vowed
he disliked such arid regions with a violence too
deep for mere words.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet he kept his own counsel and plodded away
alongside his pal as if he had no personal feelings
in the matter whatsoever. Far off in front
of them they could see the line of peaks studded
against the sky once or twice Perk felt certain
he had caught a fluttering light aloft such as
might spring from a passing plane but in every
instance he finally decided it must be some shooting
star, ducking behind the mountain range,
leaving a trailing wake behind that but reflected
its passing glory.</p>

<p class='c013'>One hour, two, and then a third dragged along
before Jack thought fit to call a halt. Never did
poor weary footsore Perk, almost used up, listen
to more welcome and delightful words than
when Jack as he drew to a halt went on to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Time to rest, partner, you know—I’d like to
find a bunch of shady trees that would afford us
a decent shelter from the blazing sun, should we
be so unfortunate as to get adrift after leaving
all landmarks behind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! bless you for sayin’ that, buddy,” Perk
was saying hoarsely, for his throat seemed as dry
as tinder, the fine sand even affecting his vocal
cords so that he would not have recognized his
own voice. “By your leave I guess I’ll lie down
and get the kinks outen my legs. Wow! that
must abeen fi’ miles if she was one—my shoes
are full o’ sand, an’ altogether I don’t feel half
the man I was on startin’ out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There are some trees over yonder, you may
notice, Perk; so after we’ve caught our second
wind we’ll take chances, and cut across to where
they lie, perhaps when morning comes tripping
along, we may climb up the face of the mountain
and get a look-in at the printing establishment
that’s set itself up in opposition to the U. S.
Treasury Department, and the Federal Bank.
Come on then, a little further where we can drop
down, and rest our weary feet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards the pair had crept in
among the sheltering trees, where Jack called a
rest, although under the impression that they
should get along further before break of day.</p>

<p class='c013'>He talked matters over with his partner, speaking
almost in whispers, since in this enemy country
no one could take anything for granted and
for all they knew hostile ears might chance to
be close by, ready to listen in.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Perk himself who proposed to move
along while the going was good.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like we might be a heap better off, old
hoss, if on’y we located up thar on the side o’ the
mountain, where we could see without our bein’
watched. I’m okay now, an’ ready for b’ar.”</p>

<p class='c013'>That was the spirit Jack liked in his mate—a
readiness to take hold and reach a decision. They
moved along toward the base of the forbidding
height, keeping a watchful eye on the eastern
sky lest dawn come and surprise them in the
open, where it would not be easy to find a hiding
place during the entire day.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fortune favored them, for they managed to
get under cover before the first gray streaks appeared
in the east. It was bound to be a strenuous
task climbing that formidable mountain side
but Jack had prepared for even this part of the
adventure.</p>

<p class='c013'>From various sources he had learned how there
were three separate means for subduing that
grim pyramid of rocks and trees and tangled
growth—in order to lessen the chances of discovery,
with unpleasant consequences, Jack had
decided to try and negotiate the most difficult
of these mountain trails in the belief that it
would offer a safer passage since evidently none
of the seething revolutionists, or their allies, the
bad men from across the border, would be likely
to follow that canyon trail when others less difficult
could be utilized.</p>

<p class='c013'>Down there hidden by the bushes and spurs
of outlying rock they employed their time in
munching what must serve as their breakfast.
Then quenching their thirst at a convenient
pool they proceeded to climb the face of
the steep elevation, making for the quaint hollow
in the crater of a long dead volcano and which
had once been a Yaqui fort.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch29' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIX <br /> <br />NEARING THE GOAL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>They had now reached that most thrilling
point in their bold venture, where they would
have to “watch their steps” most carefully, lest
an incautious act precipitate a calamity that must
end all their hopes as well as snuff out their
lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>This breeding place for inflammatory embers
of Mexican revolutionary disappointed political
generals, and their immediate retainers, was
about as safe for the two sky detectives as a cage
of Bengal tigers would have been once let their
presence be suspected, and the entire neighborhood
would be scratched over as with a fine-tooth
comb in the endeavor to discover their
hiding place and should they be rounded up it
needed no magician to prophesy what their fate
must be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack led the way, with Perk following at his
heels, every sense on the alert. The native cougar
of that historical group of mountains could
hardly have crept along with greater care than
did the two human sleuth hounds of the law.
Every advance was attempted only after a careful
survey of the entire neighborhood—at the
sound of some faint bird-call Jack would sink
down and flatten himself upon the ground, his
example being imitated by his shadow.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this caused their progress to be exceedingly
slow but time did not enter into their calculations
so much as security—many hours must
pass ere Jack could figure on the arrival of those
upon whom everything depended and they
might as well make use of the entire morning in
climbing higher and higher toward their ultimate
goal.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once when they chanced to be resting their
tired limbs, snug in a sheltered nook behind a
mass of brushwood, Jack turned and looked back.
The site was especially fine for looking out on
the level stretch toward the spot where they had
landed during the preceding night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, watching the actions of his comrade,
could easily give a close guess as to what Jack
had in mind. This opinion was made more convincing
when he saw the other get out the useful
binoculars, and apply them to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Keenly he kept tabs on the others and was
finally thrilled to note the pleased nod Jack gave
as if wholly satisfied.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk touched him on the arm, and as Jack
turned made motions with his head, while his
eyebrows went up, his expression without a single
word being spoken signifying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How come?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take a look for yourself, and tell me if you
can get the first glimpse of our old crate” suggested
Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ doin,” whispered Perk, after a most
diligent search; “an’ if we can’t get a whiff o’
the boat, with these glasses, I kinder guess
nobody ain’t agoin’ to locate it with their naked
eyes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which same lets us out from any danger in
that quarter,” came softly from Jack, whose face
for the moment lost some of the strained look it
had borne during the last few hours.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never saw a better sample o’ camouflage
when I was across the big pond alistenin’ to the
smash o’ the rip-roarin’ German guns,” asserted
Perk; and then “dried up” when he saw the
other press a finger on his lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>Higher they climbed, like monkeys, taking all
manner of desperate chances when necessity
arose but so cautious was Jack in leading the
way that nothing amiss came about, every obstacle
being successfully surmounted until
shortly before the noon hour they found themselves
in a position to spy upon the camp of their
intended prey.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was intensely interested in what he now
visioned. The old crater, resembling an immense
football bowl, as adopted by some Eastern
colleges, looked as though it might have proven
well nigh impregnable as a fortress where the
fighting Yaquis were able to hold an army at
bay—which feat history records as an actual fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>Scattered about the depression were scores of
rude dwellings, some built of rocks, while others
more modern had walls composed of sun-baked
bricks, known throughout all Mexico as <i>adobes</i>.
Men and women, also children, could be seen
moving about, preparing the noonday meal or
partaking of their customary frijoles, hot tamales,
or it might be maize cakes cooked in the
hot ashes of fires, and with black coffee as a
beverage.</p>

<p class='c013'>The picture appealed to Perk, who delighted
in novel scenes nor did it seem to lose any of
its thrill from the fact that, as he very well knew,
the men he was staring at so eagerly were most
likely as tough a brand of desperadoes and villains
as could be grouped together anywhere on
earth—ready to fight, hold up trains, or commit
all manner of pillage at the drop of a hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>He marveled at the sagacity shown by Slippery
Slim in deciding to join forces with these
firebrands of the back country, with the idea of
thus securing the greatest safety for his own
lawless operations.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this while Jack had been keeping close
watch, in hopes of being able to pick out the
figure of the man he had been deputized to bring
back to the States so he might be prosecuted for
his crimes, and sent to Atlanta. There he would
possibly end his days in seclusion, with a large
portion of the Southwest breathing more freely
since they need no longer fear the avalanche of
counterfeit currency that had been demoralizing
business for such a long spell.</p>

<p class='c013'>After all it was Perk who made the discovery,
he chancing to be carefully handling the binoculars
at the time. He handed the glasses over to
his mate, and told Jack just where to look, using
as few words as possible, and keeping his voice
very low.</p>

<p class='c013'>Long and earnestly did Jack follow the movements
of the remarkable character who had been
described in his hearing so many times. What
satisfaction it afforded him to know he was actually
in sight of the big game and if only his
plans carried through his hour of triumph was
steadily drawing closer and closer. In imagination,
as he continued to watch the moving figure,
he could vision the pleasure it would afford him
when he could turn in his report to his Chief,
and mark it as completed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon drifted along, and night approached.
Nothing could be done to hasten the
crisis; they must wait patiently, and continue to
shape their plans until the expected smoke signal
told them Morales and his rough riders had
reached the foot of the Sierra Madres ten miles
further south and when assured by means of a
counter signal that everything was working well,
start to cover the last lap of their long ride, leave
their mounts at a safe distance, and complete the
journey on foot.</p>

<p class='c013'>When darkness fell the picture was even more
fascinating to Perk than before, with a number
of fires lighting up the huge bowl, the sound of
women chattering in Spanish, and children playing
just as all youngsters might do while from
time to time he could catch strains of music, telling
that some amorous swain might be practicing
on his guitar, as all who have a drop of Spanish
blood in their veins invariably love to do when
at leisure.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk doubtless made many a grimace while
partaking of the light refreshment afforded by
the tough pemmican Jack had produced, as their
sole means for staying their empty stomachs for
when the evening breeze wafted some of the
odors from the cooking fires down below it almost
set him wild with a desire to partake of hot
food. But he knew what he was up against, and
sternly repressed the inclination to groan his
protest.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was one of the longest nights Perk ever
knew. The mountain air, too, was cold, especially
along toward the last few hours and since
they were debarred from the joy of indulging
in a campfire, Perk could only lie there and
shiver. He never was so glad to see the pink
sky in the east as on that occasion.</p>

<p class='c013'>The day was but a repetition of their former
afternoon with their sole recreation being the
chance it gave them to watch Slippery Slim’s
movements whenever he appeared coming out of
what seemed to be a cavern of some sort from
which at several times when the racket from many
tongues died down Perk could catch a strange
rumbling sound, accompanied by what seemed
to be a blow, and which he could easily believe
must be the working of the printing press that
had been carried all the way from the States in
order to be able to produce those wonderfully
clever notes that had deceived many shrewd
bank tellers by their deceptive qualities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then at last Jack discovered, just as night had
begun to fall, three columns of smoke rising toward
the heavens from far down the wild Sierra,
telling how that Morales and his troop had arrived,
and that the curtain was about to rise on
the last scene of the international drama.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch30' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXX <br /> <br />JACK GETS HIS MAN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Immediately on discovering the welcome signal,
Jack dispatched Perk to put a match to the
heap of brush they had arranged well out of sight
from the depression where the skeleton revolutionary
army was slowly assembling its pitiful
force of the dissatisfied generals who had been
counted out in the last national election.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk understood what was expected of him,
and managed to send up a single smoke signal,
allowing it to have but a brief life and then hastening
to smother the fire. As Morales was expected
to be on the watch for just such a sign,
he would lose little time in starting to carry out
his part in the attack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In three hours they will be climbing the
mountain by way of the old Yaqui trail we followed,”
Jack was telling his chum, when the
other returned to his side, flushed with the success
of his labors. “It is time for us to make a
forward move, so that we may be ready to strike
as soon as the camp quiets down and corral our
man, leaving it to Morales to carry the fort itself
by storm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This they set about doing without any further
delay. Dodging from rock to rock, taking advantage
of every outlying spur, as well as patches
of hardy bushes, and other objects that were
likely to conceal their movements from any
watchful eyes but always creeping downward,
they crawled along like two great lizards such,
as Perk could remember seeing when in the
Philippines.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the time they were ready to slip into the
underground pressroom of the lawless printing
company’s plant, Jack figured the three hours
had just about expired, and that it was now up to
them to make the first hostile move that would
precipitate the assault.</p>

<p class='c013'>In thus deciding to make a start he was influenced
by seeing an agreed upon signal from
the same hiding place he and Perk had held for
so many hours, and which told him the troopers
had finally succeeded in climbing to the position
assigned to them when plans for action were
formed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Flattening themselves out against the dark
wall of a small cliff Jack and Perk glided along
until they arrived at that aperture in the solid
rock they knew to be the entrance to the wonderful
underground retreat that had been described
by Simeon at the time when in his desperation
he gave his confederates away and from which
they had watched Slippery Slim come and go
during those long hours of their espionage.</p>

<p class='c013'>Slipping inside, they found themselves in a
corridor that led into the body of the mountain
with a gleam of light beckoning them to advance.
In this fashion they kept moving, gliding from
one point to another, until eventually they had a
clear view of the little machine that was working
so industriously in turning out the bogus
money, hour after hour, as though the demand
were without limit.</p>

<p class='c013'>How Perk did stare, and hold his breath when
realizing that they were upon the verge of accomplishing
their great undertaking. Slippery
Slim was doing no actual manual labor himself,
but he kept close watch over the two men who
ran the press, closely scrutinizing the printed
bills as if to detect the slightest inaccuracy, and
correct it without delay.</p>

<p class='c013'>No wonder, Jack told himself, the product of
his skill had startled the financial world by its
genuine appearance, when such a master in his
particular line took such personal pains to see
that the work was carried out in its most minute
details.</p>

<p class='c013'>In whispers Jack informed his backer what his
duty would be when the roar of guns and hoarse
shouts from without announced that the picked
troopers had actually launched their long deferred
assault. Jack had taken it upon himself
to close in on the chief worker in that little
coterie, and have the glory of capturing Slippery
Slim unaided but meanwhile Perk might find
plenty of action in holding up those two others
who were second in importance only to the leading
figure.</p>

<p class='c013'>The tension had become almost unendurable
when suddenly there broke out a frightful uproar—women
were shrieking, children’s high
pitched voices told of intense alarm; men gave
tongue, and above it all guns began to sound with
deadly import, until the basin rocked with the
dreadful clamor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack waited no longer, but giving Perk a kick
on the shins to tell him to get busy he rushed
headlong toward Slippery Slim, holding his automatic
ready for instant service, knowing as he
did that such a desperate bad man as Slim
was reckoned from all accounts, would not be
apt to surrender so long as there remained the
slightest chance for a getaway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nor was he mistaken in judging the character
of the man who had so long defied the shrewdest
detectives of the United States Secret Service
for when Slim found his way to the open air
barred by such a determined looking figure, he
snatched out his handy gat and made as if to open
fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>For once he was just a trifle too slow with his
service gun, for Jack, clever lad that he was
along the line of firing off-hand, managed to send
a bullet through Slim’s right shoulder that crippled
him, so that his own weapon went rattling
to the stone under his feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put ’em up!” Jack was saying, covering his
man as he spoke and having no desire to commit
suicide, Slippery Slim obeyed the call; and
instantly afterwards suffering the painful ignominy
of having his wrists encircled by a pair
of nice new steel bracelets.</p>

<p class='c013'>So far so good, with Jack, his own share of the
capture an accomplished fact, able to turn in
order to lend Perk a helping hand. It was not
needed, for Perk had descended on those two
muscular chaps like a thunderbolt, knocking one
down with a terrific jolt under the chin and
causing the other to look along the short barrel
of his blued automatic, he having discarded the
repeating rifle for the time being in favor of
the easier handled pocket gun.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the trio of discomfited rogues were all
handcuffed, Jack and his reliable partner turned
and faced the other way, so as to be ready for a
rush, should some of those valorous generals
decide to take advantage of the defensive security
of the rock cave, and bolt into its gaping mouth.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being actually attempted they met with
a demoralizing surprise when they found themselves
the objects of a hot fire, that brought about
a complete right-about face movement and
presently forced their ignominious surrender to
the gallant Colonel Morales and his fierce fighters,
who had once before gone through an interesting
campaign in that same old extinct volcano
vent, with warlike redskins as their opponents.</p>

<p class='c013'>The end was not long in coming, with many
of the would-be revolutionists holding up their
hands in complete surrender others escaping
by losing themselves along the scraggly sides of
the mountains and not a few either slain outright,
or seriously wounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and his chum had a chance to meet the
doughty Colonel Morales, pride of the Mexican
army, and be congratulated on their clever work
of rounding up such a jack-o’-lantern, fly-by-night
as Slim Garrabrant. Of course the two
comrades were eager to start back to the other
side of the border, since complications might
come up over their legal warrant to arrest a criminal
so badly wanted by the Washington authorities,
but who had made his headquarters south
of the international line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly they handed over Slim’s two lieutenants,
who would have to answer to a charge
of being hand-in-glove with those plotting generals,
and doubtless find themselves incarcerated
in a Mexican dungeon for some years, a fate that
made Perk shudder to contemplate.</p>

<p class='c013'>While he stood guard over their prisoner, Jack
sent Perk off at dawn, mounted on one of the
cavalry horses, and accompanied by a soldier
who would fetch back both animals, Perk’s duty
being to get the stranded ship off the ground,
and drop down at a more convenient spot closer
to the former mountain stronghold of the tiger-like
Yaquis.</p>

<p class='c013'>By nightfall they were hundreds of miles on
their way over Arizona and New Mexico, Jack
having decided to carry his prisoner, whose
wound did not prove to be very serious, though
painful enough—all the way to Washington, and
present him to his superior, with his customary
air of not realizing that he had done anything
extraordinary.</p>

<p class='c013'>That this thrilling feat was only a common
occurrence in the lives of such intrepid manhunters
as serve the Government through the
agency of the Secret Service and that from time
to time Jack and Perk might with reason be
expected to duplicate such adventurous feats can
be set down as certain; indeed, the title of the
next number in the Sky Detective Series, “<i>Eagles
of the Sky; or With Jack Ralston Along the Air
Lanes</i>,” a tale of the smugglers of the Florida
Coast, will grip the reader from start to finish,
and prove to be one of the most thrilling stories
ever written for lovers of action and valor.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project

<div>
  <h2 id='ch01' class='c011'>CHAPTER I <br /> <br />READY FOR THE TAKE-OFF</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>It was a day in the late Fall when Jack
Ralston, accompanied by his best pal, Gabe
Perkiser, known simply as “Perk” by all his
friends, found themselves climbing out of a
hired taxi that had halted on the border of
Candler Flying Field just a short distance out
of Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! reg’lar mob out here today, seems
like,” observed Perk, as he took note of the
triple line of cars parked around the field, with
its numerous up-to-date hangars, and with ships
coming and going every few minutes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, you see Perk, it happens to be a big day
at stunt flying, with fat prizes for the winners.
All the better for us, I’d say, since our take-off
will hardly make a ripple in the pond, with all
this confusion going on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing, my boy,” continued Perk, with
one of his humorous grins that betokened a good-natured
chap; “and privacy’s just what we crave.
I guess now that might be the mail comin’ from
down East an’ New York?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A rotten guess then, Perk,” chortled the
other; “Eastern mail boat was due here at six-ten
this morning; the Pitcairn Aviation concern
handle that route, as well as the run between
Atlanta and Miami down in Florida; and I’m
telling you for a fact the boys holding the stick
with <i>that</i> corporation are nearly always on time
to the dot, come storm, come fog as thick as
pea-soup. The schedule I glimpsed at the Atlanta
post office gave the time of the East Coast
ship as seven-thirty P. M.; that from New Orleans
at six-thirty P. M.; and the one from
Chicago about the same time. So you see it
couldn’t be a mail crate dropping down right
now, unless they’d had to make a forced landing,
and lost time in making repairs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, come to think of it I sure did hear a
bus passin’ over just at peep o’ day,” admitted
Perk. “Let’s have a look-in while we’re here,
and see what a bag o’ tricks these stunt flyers
are holdin’ up their sleeves, so’s to give this
crowd a row o’ thrills.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suits me, Perk; no great hurry about our
jumping off, so long as we pull the gun before
dark sets in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! little difference it makes on a patch
as well lighted as this Candler Field o’ your
home city, old boy; and with a flashlight beacon
set every ten miles all the way down to Orleans,
to keep us on our course. Look at that guy
fairly burning the air like hot cakes—he must
be tryin’ to beat the speed record, I guess, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hardly a day comes without some record
going by the board,” remarked Jack, who had
a reputation as a safe and sane pilot, although
on occasion he had been known to put through
some tricks so death-defying as to make the
hearts of the spectators seem to jump up in
their throats with the thrill.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was quite correct when he stated that
Atlanta was the home city of his close friend
and chum; although Jack’s family had moved
away years back, and become fruit raisers in
far-off California. Still, having spent some
years in the Georgia capital Jack always liked
to drop in and renew a limited number of old
friendships when opportunity offered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack Ralston had begun his aviation work
starting at the lowest round, that of a Gypsy
pilot, flying an ancient boat at County Fairs and
Harvest Home gatherings; doing aerial stunts,
and “bailing out” by means of a parachute while
another pilot ran the ship; also taking up air
minded “sand-bags” as passengers at so much
each person.</p>

<p class='c013'>From this modest beginning he had finally
accepted a position with an aircraft corporation
having contracts with the Post Office Department
at Washington for carrying the mails, and
later on express matter as well; and last of all
working for Uncle Sam through joining the
Secret Service corps of skillful detectives, whose
activities covered every part of the Nation, and
even to adjacent countries as well.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the Government wearied of the bold
doings of one “Slippery Slim” Garrabrant, and
decided to “clip the wings” of that audacious
freebooter and bogus-money crook, it was only
natural they should pick Jack for this service.
The reasons for doing so were many, but what
counted most was Jack’s well known cleverness
as an all-round air pilot; for it happened that
the slick rogue who had been giving the revenue
men such a wild-goose chase, with his thumb
held up to his nose, so to speak, was himself a
remarkable master of the air lanes, he having
been an ace as a flying pilot over with the army
on the Argonne front in France.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since as a rule this troublesome offender carried
on his bold enterprises by means of a handy
plane—frequently with a single assistant, who
helped handle both ship and cargo—the man
thus selected to put a crimp in his activities was
likewise given full permission to engage a helper
from the same arm of the Government forces,
one who must of course know something about
the handling of a plane, so that in case of necessity
he could serve as co-pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack lost no time in picking Gabe Perkiser,
otherwise known simply as “Perk”—a man who
had supped with adventure since he was “knee
high to a duck”—a half Yankee—half Canuck,
drifting into the army, and serving with the
sausage observation balloon corps over in
France; from which patriotic occupation he
later on became a champion light-weight boxer.
Leaving the ring while as yet undefeated he
served for several years with the Canadian
Mounted Police. Here his smartness in usually
fetching back his man, no matter what the difficulties
that had to be surmounted, attracted
the attention of a gentleman connected with
Uncle Sam’s Secret Service, just then moose
hunting over the northern border, who finally
influenced Perk to join up with his force.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and the other had met under peculiar
conditions when both were tracking a bunch of
check raisers floating across the country and
leaving a wide swath of victims in their path.
They had become more than friends, although
meeting but seldom; then, when the opportunity
came for Jack to call upon Perk to join him in
the new job that had been turned over to his
charge, the latter had responded with alacrity.</p>

<p class='c013'>So here they were, on the threshold of an
affair that promised to engage their united talents
in running down the leader of the most
troublesome gang of counterfeit currency makers
known to the Government agents in the last
ten years.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every clue possessed at Headquarters had
been turned over to Jack at the time he was
given authority to carry on as the situation demanded;
although this information was a bit
limited, and much was left to the shrewdness
of the two trail hounds themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no hurry at all, and Jack had
always been one of those cautious workers who
meant to provide for all sorts of emergencies.
Only too well did he know how many a splendid
undertaking went on the rocks from lack of
foreseeing the next move on the part of the
astute criminals whose apprehension meant so
much to the Government, as well as the folks
they were victimizing.</p>

<p class='c013'>But by now he had decided everything was
arranged so far as human means would permit,
and that it was high time they started on their
long chase. Their boat, a Stinson Detroiter, a
monoplane with a Wright Whirlwind motor,
and reckoned to be an unusually swift craft, was
already loaded, and ready for immediate departure.
It had been stored in one of the big
hangars connected with the Candler Flying
Field but could be taxied into position when
Jack felt ready to skip off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their flying togs were also contained in a
locker in the same hangar, and could be donned
in a jiffy, even to the ’chute harness that was
so familiar to Jack, and a constant reminder of
early experiences when he was accustomed to
carry out his daily program of “quitting the
ship” with as much <i>sang froid</i> as though the
jump into space from a five thousand foot ceiling
were absolutely next to nothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>But plainly Perk was becoming a bit restless,
as though eager to be on his way; which fact
doubtless influenced Jack to eventually give the
word that took them to their hangar. Here
they commenced preparing for a night flight
that was expected to land them in New Orleans,
where Jack was to interview a certain representative
of the Government service, from whom
he anticipated receiving a few valuable tips that
would give them something tangible and serve
as a beginning of their arduous chase.</p>

<p class='c013'>While they were thus engaged someone
hailed them with a boisterous greeting, at which
Perk grinned, and made a suitable reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hey, Scotty, this your night off, is it—got
in from your route okay, and stepped out to see
the boys cut a few figger-eights in the sky—just
can’t keep away from the game, even when you
got a lay-off? What’s new, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They told me at the house you expected to
step off tonight, boys—is that a fact, or did they
slip an easy one over me, I want to know?” demanded
the other, who was apparently a mail
pilot friend of theirs—in fact, having the adjoining
room at the small hotel where they were
stopping.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” Jack told him, secretive as usual,
“we’re going further, and boosting the Stinson
Detroiter ship by showing what it has to set it
above most other boats. Plans not fully arranged
as yet, but we’re on our way; so it’s good-bye,
and good luck to you, Scotty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about that news, Scotty?” the insistent
Perk went on to demand, being by nature one of
those stubborn chaps who can never be happy
until they get what they are after, no matter
how trivial it may seem.</p>

<p class='c013'>The air mail pilot scratched his head, and
then with a grin answered Perk’s question.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much along the line of aviation;
but something queer happened to me—say, did
you boys sleep at home last night while I was
on the road?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We sure did,” Perk told him, and then
added: “What makes you ask that, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Didn’t hear any sort of racket in my den
did you, fellows?” continued the other; at which
Perk, after exchanging a look of bewilderment
with his pal, hastened to answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a thing, Scotty; but then you know I
sleep like a log; and it’d have to be a thunderclap
to wake me up; what’s been going on?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You got me guessing, Perk,” said the other,
with a look of disgust; “only when I got in this
morning I found my room looking like a hurricane
had struck it, my things tossed out of drawers,
my trunk broken open, and say, you never
saw such a dirty mess. Course I asked the boss
what it meant; but he was as much surprised
as I was—talked with every servant from the
cook down to Mary the chamber maid; but
nobody could tell a darned thing about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again Jack and Perk exchanged a swift
glance, as though the same idea had struck both
of them. Scotty did not appear to notice this,
being too worked up with the mystery that had
so suddenly gripped his fortunes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did you lose anything worth while, Scotty?”
Jack asked, in a voice that suggested sympathy;
but to his surprise the other shook his head in
the negative, and even grinned as he lifted his
heavy eyebrows to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s the funny part of it, boys; whoever
the sneak thief was, he didn’t even dent me a
little bit—so far as I c’n see not a blessed thing
is missing—fact is, I’m even better off than before
he paid that queer visit, ’cause he left this
old pocketbook mixed up with my traps; and
it ain’t mine for a fact, though I’m meaning to
spend the little wad of dough it holds. Like
manna coming down to the children of Israel
in the Wilderness, wouldn’t you say, boys?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lucky old hoss you are, Scotty,” remarked
Perk, enviously; while Jack nodded his head as
though to echo the sentiment.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c014'>CHAPTER II <br /> <br />THE LUCK OF SCOTTY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Happen to have that pocketbook along with
you, Scotty?” asked Jack, in a matter of fact
tone; just as though he might be possessed of
ordinary curiosity concerning so amazing a
visit; since never before had he heard of a night
prowler leaving his own money behind him,
when his intention had been to rob his victim.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing, Jack,” promptly replied the air
mail pilot; “here, take a squint at my Christmas
present, dropped in by old Santa Claus
a bit before the reg’lar holiday season,” and with
a laugh he chucked the object in question into
the hand of the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Old, just as you remarked, Scotty,” observed
Jack, “and used a long time. It must have
slipped out of his pocket when he worked your
stuff over to mix it up like the devil.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Open it up and see what the blessed chump
left me in place of his card,” the other continued,
looking exceedingly proud over his lucky
find.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did that with alacrity; in fact it
was what he intended doing, for reasons of his
own; something more than curiosity influencing
him, it would appear.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gee whiz! a neat little bunch of the needful,
I’d say, Scotty, old hoss!” burst out the envious
Perk, his eyes fixed full upon the contents of
the much worn pocketbook, which Jack was
holding in his hand and apparently interested
in counting, for there were a number of bank
notes for various amounts, and among them just
three five-dollar bills, seemingly quite fresh,
though a bit soiled, as though they had been in
circulation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nineteen smackers in all,” announced Perk,
showing that he had also been keeping tabs on
the count. “Well, wouldn’t that knock you cold
though? Huh? that same caller must’ve been
looking for <i>me</i>, and just missed connections by
striking the next door. Well, here’s wishing you
the same old luck every time a sneak thief pays
you a visit, Scotty boy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack on his part was feeling of the three five-dollar
bills, and holding them up to the light
from the western sun that managed to come
into the hangar by way of the open doors.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What ails you, Jack?” demanded the recipient
of Fortune’s smiles, as he noticed these
strange actions on the part of his new friend.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much,” he was told, “only I’m going
to give you a bit of advice, partner, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to it, boy; always willing to take it
when it seems sound!” snapped the mail carrier,
briskly enough, still more than curious.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you’re wise, Scotty,” went on Jack, smilingly,
“you’ll not try to pass any one of these
five-dollar bills until you’ve asked the opinion
of some bank teller—it might get you into
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Zowie! what’s that you’re saying, Jack—don’t
tell me they’re off-color bills, counterfeits
in fact. Wouldn’t that be a rotten deal to hand
out, and me figgering how I’d spend them? Is
<i>that</i> what you mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon it’s so, Scotty, much as I hate to
knock your good luck,” Jack told him, with a
shake of his head. “I happened to have a little
experience in a small bank some years ago and
they did say I showed signs of being a clever
detector of bad money. That’s a clever job all
right; but I’m afraid it won’t stand the wash
worth a cent. Go slow, and don’t count your
chickens before they’re hatched. Also I’d advise
you not to go around telling about your windfall
until you’ve shown this stuff to some friendly
bank official, whose advice you’d be willing to
take. If he says it’s good stuff why forget what
I’m saying, and go the limit. But we’d better
be finishing our own job, Perk, and get off on
our jump.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Scotty hung around for a short time, looking
puzzled, as though he hardly knew how much
to believe. What Jack had said in his friendly
fashion had doubtless cast quite a damper on
certain bright dreams in which he had been indulging.
However, he finally decided to take
himself off, evidently eager to know whether
the laugh was on him or not, for he called out:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goodbye, Jack, Perk; and be sure to look me
up when next you drop in at Candler Field Airport;
like as not I’ll still be on my old job here,
unless they decide to transfer me somewhere else.
And say, Jack, I’m meaning to take your advice,
and get an opinion on this here stuff ’fore I try
to pass it out on any old duffer. So-long boys
and luck!”</p>

<p class='c013'>When the two comrades, adventure bound,
found themselves alone they looked at each other
in silence for almost a full minute, when a grin
started to travel over Perk’s well bronzed face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, wouldn’t it jar you though, to have such
luck knock at your door, and then give you a sly
kick?” he demanded of his companion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To tell the honest truth, Perk, I’m not thinking
about Scotty and his queer windfall; it’s
our own great good luck that’s making me suspect
we’re bound to carry this job through with
flying colors.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Eh? now what d’ye mean by saying that?”
asked the other hastily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right in the beginning, Perk, we seem to
have stumbled on a nice little plum in the shape
of a clue—flung directly at our heads, you might
say in the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! do you mean to tell me those bogus
notes were off the same plates we’ve been
hearing so much about lately that I’ve been
dreamin’ I was tied hand an’ foot, an’ poked
under a dozen bales of them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just that, as sure as you live, partner,” said
Jack, composedly; but if he could take it so
coolly, not so his right bower who showed signs
of extreme excitement and satisfaction, for he
thrust out his hand, that had so often been an
object of vast respect on the part of some welter
weight boxer, and insisted that Jack accept a
gentle shake.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re sure Fortune’s favorites,” Perk was
saying, striking an attitude as he thus proudly
spoke; “an’ with such luck hoverin’ over our
heads I vow all the Lower Regions with its devils
can’t prevail against us. But see here, old hoss,
there’s more than chance in this break o’ the
party who broke through Scotty’s door, and
panned all his traps—I guess now he must have
missed a cylinder, an’ jest passed us by in a
ground loop.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was accustomed to the other’s quaint way
of expressing himself, for he lost no time in
adding:</p>

<p class='c013'>“About that way, I take it, Perk. And if
what we suspect turns out to be true, it stands to
reason there’s some sort of big combine back of
it all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“With this same Slippery Slim Garrabrant
pulling the wires for the whole bunch, is that
what you mean, Jack?” demanded the other flyer
quickly; for when once set on the right track
Perk’s mind could travel speedily enough.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s certainly his brain that’s built up this
wide flim-flam trade in the make believe green
stuff that’s been fooling a whole lot of bank tellers,
it’s so near the genuine article. To
smash the combine we’ve got to check up on
Slim; after he’s caged the entire arrangement’s
bound to fall through.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, partner; and them’s my sentiments
every time,” admitted the eager Perk. “And
here, when we’re starting out to pull off our
fresh stunt, I’m wishing all the luck that’s going
to our little game. Meaning to give her a last
checking over, eh, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s a habit of mine, as you know, Perk; and
you might amuse yourself stowing the cargo
we’ve taken aboard, so’s to let us have room for
our feet when we take off. From the looks of
the junk you picked up anybody’d reckon we
planned to go into camp for a week or two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, mebbe that’s what’ll happen to us before
we strike pay dirt in this ticklish job,”
asserted Perk, stoutly. “You know we figgered
things out, and made up our minds this same
slick article of a Slim might have his hangout
over the line in Old Mexico, where he prints
his bad bills, and then comes across the line with
a big bunch in his ship, so’s to scatter the stuff
around to his agents in Texas and Arizona, or
it might be all through Southern California. If
that guess turns out to be a bullseye we might
be away off the line of travel for days at a stretch,
and a grub stake’d turn the trick okay, I’m thinking,
boss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack made no reply, for he was already busily
engaged in looking over his crate. This was, as
he had mentioned, an old habit, contracted in
the early days of his career as an aviator of sorts;
and most likely such extreme caution had saved
his life more than once.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he too worked close by, Perk was thinking
more or less about something that had caught
his ever watchful eye just before they entered
the hangar to make these last preparations for
their southern flight. As usual he was unable
to keep his speculations entirely to himself, since
he always liked to compare notes, and find out
whether his companion’s views coincided with
his own.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, Jack, did you happen to notice that
Ryan ship they’d just taken out of the shed before
ours?” he demanded, while still lifting
packages of various supplies, and stowing them
away in a shipshape fashion; so they would not
be likely to shift, and thus imperil the safety
of himself and comrade, should they chance to
encounter rough weather later on.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not particularly,” came the answer. “I was
too busy over my own affairs to bother with anything
that didn’t concern me in the least. What
of it, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much, old hoss, only it was a next
to new bus, and hadn’t been flown more’n a few
thousand air miles, I’d guess. Couple of fellers
seemed to be the crew, one of ’em lookin’ like
he might be a pilot; and the other a chap that
was out to have a jolly good time sportin’ for
sport. I saw him handlin’ some sort of gun,
which made me guess he was down South for
the shootin’ season—mebbe after bear in the
Louisiana canebrakes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack laughed as if amused, for he had noted
the way in which the other made this stab at
what might be the designs of the unknown
parties.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Feel a bit envious I take it, Perk,” he observed,
laconically. “Always did yearn for the
day to come when you’d have a ship of your
own, and could spend all your spare time jumping
about the country, enjoying yourself with
rod and gun. Cheer up, old sport, you may live
to see that day yet, if things break right for us
in a few big games like this one we’re running
down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thanks for your good luck wishes, Jack,” the
other was saying; “I c’n just picture the bully
times that pair’ll like enough have sitting by
their camp-fire, living on game they’ve knocked
over, and not caring a darn whether school
keeps or not. Oh! well, if I live long enough
mebbe I may have a whiff of that kind of life
before I kick off for keeps; they say everything
comes to the man who waits, and that’s me.
There, that finishes my job, with everything
stowed away as slick as you please. When you’re
ready, Jack, we’ll be on our way.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c014'>CHAPTER III <br /> <br />HEADED SOUTH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Apparently Jack had completed his task
about the same time, for he was adjusting his
’chute harness, without which he seldom made a
long distance flight. This was only second nature
to him, because of the long experience he
had had in barnstorming, and doing stunts for
a living in years gone by.</p>

<p class='c013'>This accomplished, he stepped outside the
hangar, and beckoned to a couple of ground
workers who chanced to be close by, possibly
in anticipation of their services being required,
with a tip in prospect.</p>

<p class='c013'>Between them the ship was moved to the open,
and after that it would be a simple thing for
Jack to taxi across the strip of ground adjoining
the big Pitcairn hangar, so as to face such
wind as was stirring.</p>

<p class='c013'>With what Perk had said concerning the new
Ryan monoplane and its crew still fresh in his
mind, Jack did give a brief glance in that quarter.
He could only see that both men were fully
equipped with dungarees, helmets, and even
chutes fastened to their backs; which combination
was an effectual disguise, since their best
friends might have failed to recognize either
of them offhand.</p>

<p class='c013'>The one who was garbed in what seemed to
be fresh clean overalls, and who must be the
employer, seemed to feel a mild interest in their
movements, for he was looking that way through
his goggles, that had been pulled down as if in
preparation for some species of flight. The
other was busying himself adjusting something,
and from his greasy dungarees it was evident
he must be the working pilot of the Ryan craft.</p>

<p class='c013'>With all the bustle that was going on covering
the stunt flying and speed races, Jack did
not bother taking a second look; he failed to
have the same interest in the possible sporting
excursion of the unknown pair that had gripped
Perk and hence failed to let the matter occupy
any more of his limited time.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon both settled down in their respective
places in the double cockpit of the ship,
Jack of course occupying the front seat, since
he had been placed in command, with the other
acting as co-pilot and observer.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a very decent crate taken in all, that
had been secured for their work on this special
occasion, for Uncle Sam is never stingy in supplying
his agents of the Secret Service with
whatever they need, from means for swift travel
to the customary “grub” necessary to their upkeep
when “on the road.” These air detectives
in whom we are particularly interested just now,
as a rule were angling for big fish, and it was
absolutely necessary they should be given a free
hand when making their demands for proper
backing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it’s goodbye to Candler Field for us
right now,” remarked Perk, as he shot a general
look around, being more or less interested in
the exciting events being pulled off in the air
circus. “Playtime’s past, and now we’ve just
got to put in our best licks along the line of
business. Huh! seems like them two guys are
meaning to pull out right on our heels, from the
lively way that greasy lad is jumping around—keeps
an eye on us in the bargain, as if it mattered
a lick whether we did get going before
he was ready to follow suit. Some folks never
do like anybody to show ’em their dust, even
when it don’t matter a pinch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then Jack waved his hand toward the two
hostlers whom he had generously tipped, and
pulled the gun in his accustomed careful fashion;
after which they started along the level
field for the takeoff, there being small necessity
for a runway on such a generous fairway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Faster and faster they flew along the ground,
and then with their wheels parting contact with
the earth up they started at an easy incline.
The roar of the motor already drowned most of
the clamor from the surging crowd, while the
racket of the whizzing propeller added to the
chorus so joyous to the ears of all real air pilots,
since nothing pleases them more than to feel they
are masters of a ship that is in “apple-pie” condition
for battling whatever lies ahead, be it
storm, fog or whatnot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Somehow Perk was twisting his head around
as if curious to ascertain whether that Ryan
crate had succeeded in imitating their example,
and was already making the preliminary dash
across the field—which luckily enough had
chanced to be fairly clear of maneuvering
planes, either descending, taking off, or being
taxied into position for the next stunt on the
program.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was getting well along by this
time, and already the first dim shadows of approaching
night were to be seen slipping
out from certain patches of pine trees ahead.
But the higher they climbed, now that a start
had been accomplished, the lighter it would become,
what with a lower horizon, and the sun
still hanging in plain sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once free from any possibility of any contact
with the wheeling and ducking planes—some of
which were doing the barrel roll, and others
making successive somersaults, with the daring
pilots proceeding while in an inverted position—Jack
could start spiraling, and climbing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rapidly was Candler Field fading from view
behind them since Jack had swung toward the
south, as if to lay his course directly for New
Orleans. Perk seemed to find a subtle attraction
back where they had just come from, since he
was again turning his head with nothing else to
do save gratify his innocent curiosity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! ’pears like they might be meaning to
strike for the Louisiana canebrake country, and
black bear diggings, just like I said,” he was
telling himself, with a chuckle of amusement
over his shrewd guess. “And say, that little
Ryan crate’s no slouch ’bout making speed, I’d
mention. Come along you sportin’ crowd—plenty
of room in the ceiling overhead, an’ nixey
a chance to bring about a collision. Take your
choice, and cut out for all you’re worth, boys.
If you get there before we do, just tell ’em we’re
acomin’ too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk continued to amuse himself in watching
the antics of the rival ship, and indulging in
all kinds of wild speculations as to what the real
object of those two sporty looking occupants
might prove to be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently thus far not the slightest suspicion
had entered his mind that the taking to the air
of the shining Ryan boat had the first thing to
do with their own skipping out, and heading
toward the Crescent City.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like as not when it gets real dark after a
bit,” Perk continued to say, being addicted to
talking to himself more or less, “we’ll soon lose
her, and have the field all to ourselves. Only
moving thing I c’n sight back there, ’cept them
circlin’ buzzards huntin’ for a carrion supper.
Guess everything’s going along first class
and we’re in for a comfortable night run down
over the corn and sugarcane country. This is
the life for little Perk, you hear me saying,
everybody—it’s got the boxin’ game, and even
that outdoor life up with the Mounties in Canada,
beat to a frazzle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk busied himself with his duties for
some time, and presently became aware of the
fact that evening was actually at hand; for the
sun had dropped out of sight over in the far
west, and looking down he found it absolutely
impossible to distinguish what lay beneath them
some two thousand feet more or less earthward—there
might be forests, farms, hills or swales
following each other in rapid succession; but all
masked by the sable curtains of night. When
the moon rose later on, its light would not afford
them any opportunity for marking any peculiarities
of the ground down there, since it must
simply present the appearance of a swiftly moving
panorama.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, moved once more by his old curiosity
concerning the ship that had started off immediately
after their own jump, again twisted his
head so as to take another backward look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hanged if she ain’t keeping on our tail right
along,” he told himself, as if a bit surprised,
though not in the least troubled, since there
could be no possible connection between this
Ryan monoplane and their own old bus, bent
on reeling off so many miles per hour, and aiming
to make the airport at New Orleans by early
dawn or before, according to how the weather
treated them, and the speed Jack could coax
from his aerial steed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Further inspection convinced Perk that the
rival ship was neither gaining nor losing as the
two sped along their way; a fact that began to
make him “sit up and take notice,” and then
express himself confidentially:</p>

<p class='c013'>“By jinks! it looks to me like that clever little
Ryan bus could make circles around our tub
’less Jack c’n squeeze a lot more snap from our
Whirlwind motor. Now what game c’n that
pair of sports be playin’ right now, I want to
know—must be they’re so used to bettin’ on
anything an’ everything they’re meanin’ to keep
right on our tail all night long, just to make us
hump along, and get the laugh on us poor
guys.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c014'>CHAPTER IV <br /> <br />THE GRIM PURSUER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>As the minutes crept along Perk’s uneasiness
commenced to make itself more manifest, finally
reaching such a condition that he felt it would
ease his mind if only he could get the opinion
of his companion on the subject.</p>

<p class='c013'>To do this it would be necessary that they
should make use of the head earphones that had
been taken along for this particular purpose.
Accordingly he quickly adjusted his own, and
then proceeded to advise Jack as to what he
wished to do. Since these useful adjuncts of the
pilot’s outfit were so arranged that they could
be slipped on and off with little loss of time,
it was an easy matter for Perk to apply them,
after which he went on to speak.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, seems like that pesky little Ryan insect’s
been tailing us right along, though mebbe
now you didn’t notice it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know it, Perk—fact is I proved that fact
to my own satisfaction, for twice now I’ve
changed our course, once into the west, and
again heading into the southwest, even if it
didn’t catch your attention.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You did that same; and say, what happened,
Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a blessed thing,” came the immediate
answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They still hung on our tail, do you mean,
old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like they did—queer how two pilots,
strangers both, would take a notion to change
their course, not once but twice running,” commented
Jack in his non-committal fashion that
always had Perk guessing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Strikes me as something more than a happy
chance,” asserted Perk, beginning to throw off
that comfortable feeling with which he had
wrapped himself as he contemplated a steady
going night run, with never a reason for anything
gripping them by way of excitement;
“ev’ry little movement of that Ryan two-seater’s
got a meanin’ of its own. Now what ails the
ducks I want to know—how c’n our movements
have a mite to do with what they’re planning
to carry out—got any idea along them lines, old
hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing definite as yet,” answered Jack; “I
was starting to figure it out just when you barged
in, and opened this talk fest up with your question.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, come to think of it, what did you make
out of that stiff yarn Scotty put over on us a
while ago?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was raw stuff for a fact; but I don’t question
anything he told us, remember, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whoever his mysterious visitor was he must
have been hunting for something, that’s dead
sure!” declared Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Something he didn’t find, either,” continued
Jack’s assistant pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Scotty was ready to swear to that fact, and
he ought to know.” Jack countered by saying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“But see here, old hoss, you’ve got some sorter
idea what the game might abeen, haven’t you
for a fact?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon I know why the sneak thief failed
to carry away the thing he was looking for, if
that’s what you mean, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As what, boss—I’m all worked up wantin’
to know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perhaps the reason might have been because
the object of his search happened at that very
time to be safe and snug in the inside pocket
of this same coat I’m wearing under my overalls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At hearing this startling announcement Perk
gave a quick look into his pal’s face, there being
just enough light remaining in the western sky
to allow this searching glance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! now I’m beginning to get somewhere,
and ready to quit this gropin’ around,
like a man in a London fog—that letter you had
this very morning from Headquarters—somehow
’r other some of the gang had wind of your
gettin’ it, and they guessed it’d be kept
safe under lock and key in your room at the
hotel; and then they got balled up about the
number on the door, so they broke into the wrong
room. Jack, am I on the right track?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems that’s so, according to my notion,
Perk; unless I miss my guess that’s the way
things stand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A disgusted grunt from Perk told that he did
not feel very happy over certain facts in the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gosh-a-mighty!” he burst out, explosively,
“if that’s right, then the tricky crowd know you’n
me are on this case—that even right now we’re
starting out to pluck their tail feathers, and
fetch that master-crook to the bar!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! I expected that would happen,” said
Jack, indifferently. “Having been told by several
of the best men in the service that Slim was
the smartest all-round dopester known in all the
land, I anticipated that he’d have means for
finding out that fact long ago—that there might
be a leak around Headquarters; for spies can
worm in almost anywhere, given an opportunity,
and the backing of a big bunch of jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yet that fact don’t seem to rattle you worth
a red cent, old hoss,” continued the puzzled
Perk, who ofttimes found the actions of his cool
partner a mystery he could not solve, because of
his own more impetuous ways.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope not,” was all Jack said in reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thunder and lightning!” ejaculated the co-pilot,
as if an illuminating idea had suddenly
flashed through his brain—“that Ryan bus,
Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what of it?” demanded the one at the
stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What if that sporty guy I told you about
should turn out to be the critter who broke into
Scotty’s room, and made it a complete wreck?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It could happen that way, Perk; seems like
you’re working on a warm scent right now. Pity
we didn’t get a good look at the gentleman before
he hid his face behind that helmet and goggles;
then at least we’d know him if ever we happened
to run across his trail.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The other was almost frothing at the mouth
through disgust and anger combined; but he
managed to say, with a select few hard words
interlarded as a vent to his outraged feelings:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Give me half a chance and I’ll mark him so
there’s be no difficulty in locating the sneak when
we meet him again—I’d put a bit of lead
through his arm that’d keep him out of the scrap
for a week of Sundays; or else clip off one of
his ears, to stamp him as a low-down crook.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack knew full well that this was no idle threat
on the part of his running mate; for Perk had a
reputation as a pistol shot second to none in the
entire service, being a natural born marksman.</p>

<p class='c013'>He lapsed into a spell of silence after making
that vicious remark; but from the way he
glanced back again and again it looked as
though Perk meant to keep close tabs on the
craft that was dogging their own ship so
steadily.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were roaring on their way, and it would
seem as if they must be showing a clean pair of
heels to anything in their rear; but just the same,
Perk, with the vision of an air-minded individual,
could readily understand how the speedy
Ryan plane was slowly but insidiously picking
up on them continuously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blamed nuisance,” he was muttering to himself
when this important fact became a positive
truth; “guess now that rip-snorter could make
circles round us, if so be he wanted to. Shucks!
what’s left to us I want to know; an’ just what
does he ’spect to accomplish with all this chasin’
us? Might as well get out my little old
six-shot bear gun, so’s to be ready in case
there’s any sort o’ ruction aheadin’ our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The idea seemed to afford him a strange sort
of grim satisfaction, for bending down he ran
his hand under the coaming of the cockpit; to
almost immediately withdraw a very decent
looking sporting repeating rifle, evidently his
working tool whenever he felt disposed to spend
a week in the wilds, either alone, or with some
boon companions also yearning for wild game
and the much desired campfire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold tight, Perk,” Jack was saying just
then; “going into a nose dive, and see if that
will upset his calculations; for he’s got me buffaloed
all right as to what’s in the wind!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Almost immediately they turned the nose of
their craft earthward, and went down on a
swift slant. Perk kept his head turned even as
this maneuvre was being executed, and what he
saw was something calculated to almost take
his breath away; for where the pursuing Ryan
ship loomed up as a shadowy form, vivid
splashes, as of fire, were coming in quick succession—he
could even imagine he heard the pulsating
staccato reports following each other in
succession, just as in those never-to-be-forgotten
days when he would have a covey of
devil-may-care German air fighters stepping on
the tail of his old-fashioned boat, and peppering
him from their rapid-firing guns!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c014'>CHAPTER V <br /> <br />THE DUEL IN THE AIR</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The significant flashes abruptly ceased; but
Perk realized this was only because the expert
pilot handling that same Ryan wasp was also
ducking down in an exact copy of their own
game.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the moment Perk lost sight of the shadowy
pursuing craft; then Jack changed his tactics,
and once again brought his boat on an even
keel. Perk strained his eyesight in an endeavor
to pick up the other ship after it too had swung
into a direct course.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Devil take that guy at the stick,” he stormed
to himself, although Jack caught almost every
word, since the earphones were still in operation,
“he’s seen our move, an’ gone us one better.
No slouch o’ a pilot, either, I’ll admit. When
that gent who goes by the name o’ Slippery Slim
picks his gang he knows how to pull trumps
out of the pack all right. Give him another
shoot, Jack, old hoss; mebbe he wont be so lucky
next time. He’s got some kind o’ a rapid-fire
shooter aboard, and had started to send a hail
o’ lead ’bout our ears just as you turned the trick
on him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was apparently quite willing to give a
repeat, for hardly had the other ceased shouting
than they again shot down in a dizzy dive
that seemed likely to lower their altitude by
something like five hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was keeping a close watch, and knew
that once more the grim pursuer had copied
their daring maneuvre.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s a good one, or I’ll eat my hat!” he burst
out, as they were “cutting a blue streak” once
more through the growing darkness, and he
could see those suggestive flashes again punctuating
the gloom in their track. “Jack, he’s
started that racket again, don’t you know; and
any second we may get a slug in our belly, bustin’
things all to flinders. Try a razzle-dazzle on
the boob, old broncho!”</p>

<p class='c013'>So making a bank, Jack changed his course,
running at right angles, and if anything at a
faster pace than ever. Perk had the situation
“sized up to a fraction,” as he himself would
have called it; he realized that it was only
through the greatest of good luck they had escaped
being hit by one of those flying missiles;
and that so long as the mysterious enemy kept
using their ship for a flying target they were in
constant peril. Despite all this ducking and
dodging on Jack’s part he did not seem successful
in throwing the pursuing craft off the track.
To be sure the darkness was gradually growing
thicker with every passing minute, and this
seemed to be their only hope of crawling out of
a “hot hole,” according to Perk’s calculations.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk afterwards frankly admitted that he was
frothing at the mouth on account of finding himself
up against a situation where the cards
seemed stacked against him—where his hands
were tied as it were, and that reckless pilot, chasing
after them hell-bent, held all the trumps.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No use tryin’ that game any longer, Jack,
boy!” he yelled suddenly. “See the glim all
’round us, partner—sure as you live they’ve
even got some kind o’ a searchlight aboard, just
like they’d planned all this thing out beforehand.
Guess now it’s up to Little Perk to put
a plug into their game. Hold her steady a bit,
boss; I’m meaning to make ’em sit up an’ take
notice they can’t hog <i>all</i> the fun going. Watch
my smoke, Jack, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a delicate situation without any doubt;
for if those aboard that little Ryan plane, taking
advantage of the halo of light covering the craft
they followed, continued to make use of their
rapidfire gun, the danger of a hit had vastly increased;
but Perk must have some sort of scheme
in mind it was evident, or he would never have
asked his chum to steady the badly wobbling
boat when such action only doubled their peril.</p>

<p class='c013'>Calmly and deliberately, as though simply
bent on fetching down a deer he wanted for
his next camp supper, steady old Perk had his
faithful gun up to his shoulder, and was sighting
that piercing glare of light that marked the bow
of the pursuing aircraft, betraying the presence
of a searchlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Possibly owing to the clamor of their own
working motor Jack could not tell when his
companion unloosed a fusilade of shots; but he
did know that something suddenly changed the
situation, and to their advantage; for as though
a blanket had been tossed over the piercing
ray the illumination abruptly ceased, leaving
them to continue their wild flight shrouded in
encompassing darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, too, the sound of Perk’s exulting yell
was quite enough to tell the story of his success
in finding a glowing target for one of his several
missiles—the old sharpshooter had evidently
lost none of his cunning by reason of a lapse in
action.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Set ’em up in the other alley, boys—give your
Dutch uncle a chance to show an old trick or
two! Now <i>will</i> you be good, or must I give
you another smash in the jaw—better haul off
while the haulin’s good, fellers—I’d sure hate to
make you crack up, and fade out!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Even though his clever shot had doubtless
utterly smashed the searchlight, and put it out
of business, that bothersome rapidfire gun was
still in working order, as Perk discovered when
once more those insistent flashes, following closely
upon each others’ heels, announced a fresh
barrage, with the unseen, unheard hissing bullets
doubtless whizzing all around them.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was adding insult to injury, Perk was
doubtless telling himself, as he realized that his
lucky shot had after all failed to daunt that
stubborn pair in the speedy Ryan ship.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You <i>will</i> have it, seems like,” he growled
to himself; for since he had discarded his earphone
harness just previous to starting his late
“shooting spree,” Perk could no longer hold
intercourse with his fellow flyer; “all right then,
I’ll try some more o’ the same sorter medicine;
what’s good for the goose orter be fine for the
gander. Mind your eye now, boys, and keep
a tight grip on your chutes if anything happens
not down in your gamble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again did the continual flash of spitting fire
from the gun afford the sharpshooter in the
chased ship abundant opportunities for focussing
his aim; although instinct may have
taken the place of vision on Perk’s part.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fortunately Jack must have been expecting
something along those lines, knowing his companion
so well, and how he was always eager
to “repeat” when things were coming his way;
for he kept the flying boat wonderfully steady
just then, even though realizing how such action
doubled their own chances of being hit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was now shooting on general principles,
in hopes of being fortunate enough to find a
billet for one of his random bullets. He went
at the business with all the <i>sang froid</i> of a veteran
fighter, accustomed to meeting hostile
craft up in the wide air spaces, or even above
the clouds—all the fierce delight of matching
his skill and life against a foeman worthy of his
steel had once more gripped the old flying warrior;
and it may be for the moment he deluded
himself with the belief that this was but a reincarnation
of those never-to-be-forgotten days
when all Europe was held fast in the throes of
the grisly war-god.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly Perk ceased firing, nor was this
caused by the magazine of his repeating rifle
being empty—he had seen that the discharges
back yonder were no longer in full blast, showing
that something must have happened to cause
such a sudden cessation to hostilities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before he could attempt to analyze what this
might mean it was all flashed before his questioning
mind—a burst of flames came from the
spot where last he had seen the shadowy shape
of their persistent pursuer clipping through
space like a blazing meteor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk sat there doubled up, his mouth half
open, staring with might and main, as some
object began to drop toward the earth with ever
increasing speed—something which he knew
full well must of necessity be the beautiful little
Ryan plane, which he had admired so much
when at Candler Field at close of the late day,
and before this wild dash into the darkness of
night began.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently one of his missiles (fired with such
grim determination when he “took the bit in
his teeth,” and struck back) had found its mark,
and unleashed the dangerous contents of the
gasoline reservoir, with the splashing fluid instantly
catching fire from the exploding spark
of the running motor.</p>

<p class='c013'>No flyer ever saw his enemy going down in a
flaming coffin without feeling compassion gripping
him; that one moment had changed his
heart from bitter hatred to a sense of pity; knowing
as he must have done that the day might
be near at hand when he too would share in a
similar dreadful fate.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so Perk found himself all in a nervous
tremble as, laying down his gun, he managed
once more to adjust the head harness, so as to
be able to again hold communication with his
fellow adventurer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c014'>CHAPTER VI <br /> <br />PARACHUTE JUMPERS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Just then Jack hurriedly banked, and swung
around as though to double back on their late
course. This of course told Perk the pilot must
be already aware of the terrible tragedy that
was being enacted close at hand, and meant to
see its finish with his own eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the abrupt change in their course he
was in time to catch a glimpse of the flaming
object still spiraling earthwards, a billow of fire
that glowed suggestively in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then far below it seemed to strike the ground—they
heard no sound whatever, but the fire
became stationary; although increasing in fury,
since the wind created by its passage no longer
whipped the devouring flames. Evidently by
the time the conflagration stopped for want of
further material on which to feed, nothing inflammable
would be left of the once haughty
little Ryan masterpiece save the engine, and
other metal parts.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the big idea, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk asked this as a leader, wishing to get a
better grip on his own nerves, since they had
been dreadfully shocked at the dire result of his
random shot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Going to circle around a few times, and drop
down a bit,” came the illuminating reply;
“though I reckon it’s no use, since nothing could
live in all that awful blast.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe not, Jack,” remarked Perk, a bit
cheerily; “but there’s a fair chance neither o’
them guys got snagged in the flash o’ that gas.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Perk, have you some foundation
for saying that?” demanded the other, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure—they jumped all right, boss,” Perk
told him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You saw them do it then, did you, boy?”
continued Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They bailed out okay—I saw two take the
jump right after the first flash came—went down
like plummets in the bargain—smart lads those
guys are, I’m tellin’ you, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>No doubt Jack was glad to hear this bit of
news, for it had filled him with horror to realize
that in order to escape they had been compelled
to ruthlessly take human life. He was
much younger than Perk, veteran of the World
War, who had grown more or less hardened
to such happenings when staking his own life
against that of a tricky German air pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Still goin’ down, are you?” asked Perk shortly
afterwards, on finding that they were still
swinging around in a wide circle, that burning
pyre far below being the hub of the wheel of
which their boat was the outer tire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Might as well,” came the ready answer,
showing that Jack had made up his mind
hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess now they’ll get down somehow, boss;
a whole lot depends on what kind o’ landin’
they’ll be able to make—if its rocks, or trees,
they got to strike it’s apt to be some hard sleddin’
for the boys. Say, ’taint possible now you’re
fixin’ to try an’ lend ’em a helpin’ hand? I’d
hate to know they’d been wiped off the map in
that hot fire; but somehow I don’t feel like
playin’ the part o’ the Good Samaritan to such
man devils as them two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No danger of my trying to make a landing
where the chances are ten to one it just <i>can’t</i> be
done,” explained Jack, seeing that his companion
was almost ready to mutiny if any such mad
proceeding were contemplated. “I’d just feel
better if I knew they’d reached ground okay;
then we could keep on our way, and it’d be up
to them to get out of the scrape.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! I get you, partner,” grunted the relieved
Perk. “Don’t think I’m bitter about the
thing, ’cause they’re sure hot stuff all right; but
I’m a bit slow to accept that forgive and forget
stuff, specially after any guy’s tried his level
best to gimme a dirty deal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll try the thing out while on the job,”
Jack announced. “Our own wonderful escape
from meeting just that same kind of fate makes
me kind of soft. Perhaps we’ll not be able to
learn a single thing; you know how it often is
when you’ve finally struck ground after quitting
the ship by the chute route—all out of breath—sometimes
knocked up a bit, if you escape broken
bones—not any shape to shout, or do anything
but just lie there, and suck in the air in big
gasps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, that’s right for you, old hoss,” Perk
readily agreed. “Me, I once got a collar bone
smashed that way. No harm in our makin’ a
few swings around these diggin’s ’fore we put
out for Orleans. That fire keeps burnin’ like
things they got sprinkled right well with the
juice when the tank blew up. Go to it, Jack,
just as you please, never mindin’ a few squeals
from a hard-boiled guy like Perk Perkiser.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m going to shut down on the engine, and
take a little glide, so we can pick up anything
like a yell,” announced the pilot a minute later.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to it—duck then, boy!” snapped Perk,
as he temporarily relieved himself of his ear-phones
in order to catch anything bordering on
a shout from the ground below.</p>

<p class='c013'>The simple expedient was carried out successfully,
and when once again they leveled out,
to continue circling, Jack asked eagerly:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get anything, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a bleat, partner,” replied the other, who
had hurriedly held his earphones in position so
as to cover the emergency.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sorry for that, but we’ll try a couple more
times before calling it all off,” suggested Jack,
who could be more or less persistent when the
occasion arose for such action, though never
carrying it so far as to be reckless.</p>

<p class='c013'>So a dozen seconds or so afterwards he again
gave warning that it was time for another drop
of a few hundred feet—not that they meant to
take any chances by getting too close to the unknown
terrain lying in the pitch blackness under
the flying ship; but simply to be able to listen
with the horrid clamor of the bustling engine
momentarily stilled.</p>

<p class='c013'>No better success followed this second maneuvre—all
was deathly silent around, above,
below, as though never a solitary living human
being existed within miles of the spot where
the destruction of the Ryan monoplane had
taken place.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll give a third and last try,” was Jack’s
announced decision, to which Perk added:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Three times, and batter’s out—by then I rather
guess we’ll be down close enough to the solid
ground to make another drop dangerous. Either
way I’m satisfied we’ve done the right thing,
old hoss. Suit yourself when you see fit to
coast,” whereupon he once more denuded his
ears of the exceedingly useful and really indispensable
phone harness, to await the occasion
of the last try in the line of an aviator’s
duty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it, Perk?—get a whisper?”</p>

<p class='c013'>They had completed the glide, and were once
more on a level course, with Jack even turning
the nose of the ship a bit heavenward; since
neither of them knew what the nature of the
ground below must be—whether some hill lay
directly ahead, against which they might smash
for a complete wipeout.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! a heap more’n that, partner!” came
the triumphant reply. “Heard a shout, an’ then
another some distance off—struck me both
jumpers had lit okay, and were tryin’ to communicate,
so’s to get together again. Guess
things ain’t so bad after all with them guys, an’
we c’n be movin’ on our way without botherin’
any more ’bout their safety. Some two-legged
varmints seem to be watched over by Old Satan
hisself, they bein’ that venomous, and evil-minded.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack made no rejoinder to this remark, tinged
with bitterness as it was, only pointed the nose
of his craft upward, and started to spiral for
altitude. Undoubtedly he was feeling greatly
relieved because of their having escaped so
miraculously from the hovering peril; and best
of all managed to turn the tables on those who
would have encompassed their destruction just
in order to defend the lawless game in which
they were engaged in connection with Slippery
Slim.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk must have been doing a little hard thinking
as the time passed and they raced on their
way, for later on he started to speak; and as
usual his line of chatter told that he was seeking
information, trying to find a solution of
certain exasperating puzzles that were “twisting
his intellects,” as he himself described
matters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Things kind o’ got me goofy, partner, an’
I’d like you to raise the curtain some, if so be
you feel so bent. First place I guess it goes
without questionin’ that these huskies must be
in cohunks with that there big gun, Slippery
Slim Garrabrant?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! that’s a dead certainty—who else would
have any reason for waylaying us in Atlanta,
and setting up this trap for us to fall into?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! then it stands to reason, boss, he’s
got means for findin’ out what the Secret Service
aims to do; an’ so has been able to play the boys
for suckers every time they set out to lay him
by the heels, eh, Jack, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s past history, Perk; even the Big Boss
got wise to it, and tried everything possible to
learn where the great leak happened; but our
experience proves they haven’t discovered it so
far. I’m making up my mind that the closer
we draw to the headquarters of this rotten clique
of crime, where they make the bogus long-green
that’s been flooding the whole West for a year
and more, why, the harder our job is bound
to be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which tickles me a heap, boy—I’m just
yearnin’ for comin’ to grips with that gazaboo
o’ a Slim; and now we’re on to the job I’ll never
be happy ’till he’s on his way to that big Government
pen we glimpsed in Atlanta, where
some other lads we helped to pinch are doin’
time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if you keep on as you’ve started, Perk,
we’ll flatten the whole gang like pancakes—they’ve
stacked up against a new sort of revenue
dog when they started a shooter of your calibre
on the trail. First you smashed their searchlight,
and then sent a chuck of lead into the
gas tank that broke up the game. That’s the
kind of a pinch hitter you are, partner; and
right now I want to congratulate you on such
dandy marksmanship.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lay off that stuff, Jack—nothin’ but great
luck fetched the bacon home for this lad. But
me, I’m shakin’ hands with myself ’cause I
had that hunch a bear gun mightn’t be such a
bad thing to tote along on a trip that’s goin’ to
carry us across the border, an’ into Old Mex,
like as not; where the greasers are sometimes
tough nuts an’ hard to handle they tell me.
’Spose we’ll run across them two hill billies
again, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wouldn’t surprise me a bit if we did,” replied
the pilot, leveling off at a three thousand
foot ceiling, and still heading due southwest.
“Like as not they’ve got plenty of ready cash
along; and after having been so cleverly upset in
their calculations, due to your beating them silly
with a barrage of hot lead, they’ll be hot to wipe
out their disgrace. Oh! yes, we’re going to run
up against that foxey pair again before the book
is closed for keeps.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c014'>CHAPTER VII <br /> <br />STRIKING THE FOG BELT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>With the stars shining brightly above them,
and a moon just past its full climbing the eastern
heavens, having dissipated the darkness of the
earlier part of the night, Jack and his fellow
voyager continued plunging along in a very
satisfactory fashion, having no reason for feeling
further concern regarding the peril to
which they had been so lately subjected.</p>

<p class='c013'>But things were not destined to continue so
comfortably for the two adventurers, it seemed.
Perk was just congratulating himself for about
the fourth time at having such a comfortable
flight, when he sat up and took notice of the
fact that those heavenly bodies were beginning
to look exceedingly hazy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Danged shame, that’s what, to spoil such a
dandy night!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What ails you now?” demanded Jack, on
hearing the other make this little remark that
bespoke exasperation at least; “another boat on
our tail?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I guess not just now,” replied Perk,
scoffingly; “one was more’n enough for a single
jump. But we’re agoin’ to run into a pesky
fog belt, sure as you’re born, old hoss!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That all?” laughed the other, who apparently
saw nothing of particular consequence
about such a common happening; “it may perhaps
manage to slow us down more or less; but
what does that matter, when we’ve got time to
burn. The Big Boss told us, remember, not to
hurry things at all—plenty of time, oodles of
money, and any backing we chose to call for in
the way of a new boat, or more helpers. We
should worry, old scout!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Tain’t that in peticular Jack,” complained
the other; “but of all things a sky detective’s got
to run smack up against, fog’s the one I despise
most. It’s got me in bad more’n a few times, so
I’ve grown to look on the peasoup stuff like it
was my—er, what-dye-call it—Nebraska, no, I
mean Nemesis.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, now you mention it, Perk, I remember
you telling me something about that strange feeling
you have creep over you. No need for you
to apologize—in my knocking around among airmen
I’ve found that often even the most daring
and reckless in the bunch had some kind of a
weakness, if only you looked far enough under
the surface; just as sometimes you’ll find a boasting
bully actually afraid of his little wife at
home, who’s smacked him with her handy rolling
pin many a time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! wasn’t I a canvas man ’long with a
travelin’ circus a wheen o’ years ago, an’ didn’t
I see the biggest elephant in captivity rear up
on his hind legs, lift his trunk sky-high in the
air, an’ squeal like fun just when a little half
grown mouse happened to run along near his
alley. Well, I’m the tusker, an’ fog is the
mouse, as you might say—we never do get on
well as a combine. Hope it hugs the ground,
an’ leaves us a clear track up among the clouds
I c’n see creepin’ up ahead yonder.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Doesn’t bother me a whit, partner; don’t
forget we’ve got that new radio beacon aboard
to try out; and if it’s as clever as I’ve heard tell
it’ll carry us along our route to Orleans through
the thickest nest of fog anybody ever stacked up
against. Naturally we can’t expect to get the
full benefit of its capacity to hold a speeding
plane on its true course; because the invention’s
hardly more than half baked up to now; but I
set it according to directions, and if at any time
we begin to slide off our course the light that
springs up is bound to give warning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A bully good layout I’d say, if it c’n do what
they claim,” ventured Perk, who undoubtedly
had read certain things concerning the new invention,
and was eager to learn just how it would
pan out. “You showed a level head, partner,
when you decided to take the offer o’ that gent
in Atlanta, and try the thing out. Guess, then,
I needn’t bother my head ’bout gettin’ astray;
if things keep bein’ invented it ain’t goin’ to be
very long till a pilot’ll get slapped good an’
hard if he misses runnin’ on a straight line, or
even veers from his proper course in a great big
blow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re living in a machine age, Perk, and
every day things are heading that way on the
run—electric helps in kitchen, factory, and even
aboard our air cruisers. While the brainwork
and strain grow harder the actual manual labor
is lessened all the time. But as you say it’s getting
a bit hazy, and chances are we’re in for a
spell of blue fog.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Ten minutes afterwards there could not be
the least doubt concerning that fact, for by degrees
even the stars vanished from view, ditto
the gorgeous round moon. Still, since the sky
remained brighter in the east, it was not at all
difficult to tell where the fair mistress of the
Southern night had hidden her face behind the
opaque veil.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was now flying by instruments alone,
since never a thing could be seen by the keenest
eye above, below—they seemed to be hung in
unlimited space; but pushing along with considerable
speed just the same, bound for the distant
city on the vast Mississippi, situated not so
very far from its delta.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus passed a full hour.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly Perk saw a small light spring into
view on one side of the plane, and it certainly
electrified him considerably.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hi! there, partner, we’re off our track—shifted
to the east, seems like, unless I’m away
wrong in sizin’ things up ’cordin’ to Hoyle.
Got to swing her to the larboard-watch side, I
kinder guess—how ’bout that, boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You hit it that time, Perk, and here she goes
to climb back to our true course. Worked just
as we figured it would, and put us wise to a fact
we’d hardly have picked up in any other way.
I reckon now this same radio beacon’s bound to
turn out a great help to the poor badgered air
pilot, flying blind when fog hides the ground
beacons, and he gets no aid from the heavens
above.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll say it’s the best thing I’ve struck for a
long time,” affirmed the delighted Perk.
“There she goes—the glim I mean—closed shop,
havin’ ’complished the business set for her;
showing we must have struck our real course
again.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Easy money,” laughed Jack, just as well satisfied.
“Makes a fellow sit up and try to guess
what the next big idea connected with aviation
will prove to be; doesn’t seem to be any limit to
the dazzling discoveries these scientific chaps’ll
turn out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, partner—like that big chute they’re
trying out, which they claim will keep any
plane from crashing—if the engine goes dead
all you got to do is to press a little button, and
when the drop comes open goes the monster umbrella,
able to hold you and the crate suspended
in the air, to gradually fall to the earth like the
colored balls from a bursted skyrocket. Great
stunt that, an’ I’m livin’ in hopes it’ll be my
luck to some day find myself aboard a ship that’s
equipped with such a giant chute, an’ have the
glorious experience of seeing the thing work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack seemed to consider it the part of wisdom
to pull up more or less, as they were in no hurry,
and could drop down on the aviation field at
New Orleans by dawn, even though they concluded
to just “loaf along.” Disliking anything
pertaining to fog Perk naturally said nothing
to hint at a desire for further speed; besides
his own good sense told him that what his mate
had just said with regard to no necessity existing
for haste, was sound logic, and a due regard
for “safety first.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So the time slipped away, with midnight finding
them past the meridian of their projected
flight. Perk had long since subsided and
seemed content to sit there in the double cockpit,
letting his thoughts roam back to the exciting
developments of the earlier night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Years had elapsed since last he watched a
doomed plane writhing and twisting in its death
agonies, with the flames wrapping it in an envelope—a
blazing coffin speeding headlong to a
final crash; and here, strange to say, after all
that time intervening he had again passed
through a similar experience. Now that he had
an opportunity to calmly review the happening,
Perk admitted he was pleased to know the two
occupants of the Ryan cockpit had apparently
escaped a miserable fate that must have been
laid at his door.</p>

<p class='c013'>Two A. M. and all’s well!</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk figured that when a few more times
sixty minutes had passed it would be time for
them to catch a first glimpse of the great rolling
turgid stream that could, when the heavy rains
united with the melting snows up in the mountains
of the Far West, create vast floods that
placed much of the low country along the river
under many feet of water. It had been a long
time since last Perk had set eyes on the Mississippi,
and hence he was considerably worked
up over the prospect of soon glimpsing the
mighty flood.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c014'>CHAPTER VIII <br /> <br />NEW ORLEANS—FIRST STOP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“There she rolls, Jack, old boy—the greatest
stream in the whole U.S.A.—I swan if she
don’t look just as fine as when I glimpsed her
for the first time many years ago!”</p>

<p class='c013'>That was Perk’s tribute on beholding the
Lower Mississippi perhaps thirty miles above
New Orleans; he displayed almost as much enthusiasm
as those early discoverers did centuries
back, when their distended eyes took in the
mighty sweep of the flood rolling down toward
its junction with the Mexican Gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was early dawn, and the fog bank had been
dissipated by a fresh breeze acting as advance
courier to the rising of the sun. Jack, looking
toward the southwest could also see the object
of his companion’s exultation, and undoubtedly
felt some of the same pleasure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When it gets a bit lighter we’ll have a far distant
view of the city, with its smoke cloud hovering
over it,” he remarked, knowing that soft coal
and southern pine as used for fuel in the Fall
and Winter seasons always caused something of
a pall to mark the site of the river metropolis.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk reached around, and drew forth a case
that on being opened disclosed a pair of pretty
decent binoculars, with which they had been
fitted out by the Washington authorities before
starting on this particular man-hunt, with an
idea that they might prove most useful sooner
or later.</p>

<p class='c013'>After clapping these to his eyes Perk announced
that he could easily pick up the goal
of their flight from Candler Field; although the
smoke did act as a screen, through which it was
not possible to see with certainty.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was now bringing out all the reserve
speed of their ship—it was of some consequence
that they make a landing as early as possible,
since he had no desire to attract undue attention,
and possibly have inquisitive newspaper reporters
to be asking pertinent questions as to
whence they came, what their identities might
be when at home, and also concerning the object
of their coming to New Orleans. Secrecy
was the foundation on which they meant to
build their plans; and from their previous experience
with those dare devils in the employ of
Slippery Slim, too much care could not be employed
in order to mask their batteries.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, too, as they approached the city Jack was
dropping down to lower levels; while on his part
Perk skimmed the whole scene, looking for the
airport they knew to be somewhere within reach
of their vision.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being presently located he called his
chum’s attention to the open field, and in almost
no time they were circling it, looking for the
best place to land.</p>

<p class='c013'>Early though it was there were moving figures
circulating around, while some sort of ship
was coming in from over the river—possibly one
of the air mail carriers from a distant station, it
might be many hundred miles away, fetching
Uncle Sam’s important letter sacks, and worthwhile
express matter, at treble the speed that the
fastest train could muster.</p>

<p class='c013'>The landing was effected without the slightest
difficulty, and hardly had their boat come
to a stop than a number of persons, most of them
connected with the ground force of mechanicians
and hostlers, surrounded the incoming
craft, paying but scant attention to the air mail,
which dropped down almost at the same moment—that
was a daily happening, a following
out of a regular schedule, to which they had
become accustomed; while the arrival of a mysterious
plane might stand for almost anything.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold fast, Perk!” said Jack, as he took off
his headphones, and raising his voice to almost
a shout, so deaf did he appear after a whole
night’s run; “don’t tumble out yet; and keep a
muffler on your gab, for we’ve got to let ’em
take it out in guessing. I’ll soon see if the
party we’re expecting to meet is on hand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He still kept his helmet and goggles in position
as he thrust his head out of the cockpit, and
raising his right hand with two fingers extended,
made a species of salute. A stout man,
with a very red face, and an air of importance,
immediately pushed through the gathering
crowd, and answered Jack’s signal with a similar
sweep of his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s okay, Perk—that’s our party, and he’s
been watching for us, showing he had my wire
last evening. Get a move on, and we’ll soon be
doubling our legs under a breakfast table.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! but that will be a joy to me,
old hoss!” Perk exclaimed; “’cause I’m as
hungry as a wolf, an’ the smell o’ coffee is apt
to set me wild. Go to it, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was paying no attention to these vaporings,
since it was a common occurrence to have
old Perk declare the bottom of his stomach was
in danger of falling out—he had met the red-faced
gentleman and they were shaking hands
as they exchanged a few words.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all fixed, comrade,” he said to Perk over
his shoulder, mentioning no names lest suspicious
ears catch them, and thus have a clue as
to their identity; “we’ll get a few of these boys
to run our boat into a hangar close by, which is
waiting for us, and then cut out for the city—and grub.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This being speedily carried out, with the
doors fastened securely, and the two flyers began
to hastily divest themselves of their working
“duds.” Before ten minutes had passed
they were on their way in a taxi the gentleman
friend had brought out, with Jack and their
host talking at a great rate; while as for Perk
he was looking out, and finding more or less enjoyment
in seeing new and novel sights along
the road.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk having been well coached as to the
necessity for caution, made it a practice to snatch
an occasional glance in their rear, looking for
any signs to indicate that their car was being
trailed; but nothing at all suspicious came to
his attention.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meantime Jack had learned that their new
friend (whose name he already knew to be Mr.
Adkins) was connected with the Administration
forces of the United States District Attorney,
having offices in the Government building—that
he had been secretly advised of their coming
days before receiving Jack’s wire; and was
ready to give them all the information possible
concerning what had been learned in connection
with the wholesale operations of the man they
had been sent out to cage, so as to effectually
remove the greatest menace that had threatened
business men of the Southwest in a decade.</p>

<p class='c013'>In due time he would post them regarding
all these important facts; meanwhile they
could take things easy, for there was no hurry,
and the game was of too much importance to
allow lax methods. When they got good and
ready they could make a start, and after that
everything must depend on their ability to beat
Slippery Slim at his favorite game of “dog eat
dog.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He steered his guests to a certain restaurant
where he knew they could be well taken care
of, and which turned out to be close to the hotel
at which they booked under fictitious names.
Here Perk was given the privilege of ordering
just what he desired along the line of rashers of
bacon and fried eggs; cornbread with syrup;
several cups of coffee taken black; and to top off
with, a Havana cigar such as he was not accustomed
to smoking, being addicted to the more
friendly pipe habit.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no talk of shop while they partook
of breakfast; such business as they had to transact
was of too delicate a nature to be discussed
in a public place, where strangers would be
coming and going, and spying eyes might be on
them every minute of the time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Later they gathered in the room at the hotel
where, behind closed and locked doors they felt
free to confer in lowered tones.</p>

<p class='c013'>Much had to be told, and numerous thrilling
accounts brought out connected with adventures
experienced by other Secret Service men in their
efforts to round up the notorious gang—all of
which had resulted in absolute defeat for the
Government agents.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shrewd men some of these parties undoubtedly
were, with a record of numerous famous
cases successfully carried through; but somehow
when they found themselves up against
Slippery Slim Garrabrant they sooner or later
fell down on the job, and had to be recalled.</p>

<p class='c013'>In fact, it was disclosed to Jack and his pal,
two different agents were never again heard
from, after secret code messages had been received
from them to the effect that they were
even then getting very close to a great discovery
that must end in the arrest of the malefactor—a
dead silence that had never been broken
seemed to signify that they must have fallen into
some sort of fiendish trap, possibly meeting with
a gruesome fate that would be forever shrouded
in blank mystery.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins, watching closely as he narrated
these uncomfortable facts, was pleased to see
that neither of his interested auditors displayed
the least sign of being disturbed, showing that
they had long since discounted everything along
this line.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c014'>CHAPTER IX <br /> <br />COACHING PERK</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Of course it was in keeping with this exchange
of confidences that Jack should relate all that
had happened to them since their arrival in
Atlanta to secure the ship awaiting them, load
it to capacity for a long voyage, and finally start
off from Candler Field.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins listened eagerly to this modest
account of what had already happened to them
as a starter in the hunt they had undertaken;
and he was visibly thrilled at hearing of the
bitter night chase, the desperate tactics undertaken
by the pair of human wolves aboard the
Ryan monoplane; and particularly when Jack
finally described in vivid language the astounding
act of Perk in first shattering the bothersome
searchlight, to follow this with his lucky
random shot that bore into the gas tank of the
pursuing craft and brought about an explosion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Possibly the urbane gentleman had never in
all his life listened to so ghastly a true story as
the graphic one thus modestly related by one
of the two participants; looking at them, with
Jack so calm and modest, giving all the credit
to his grinning accomplice, he must have decided
in his astute mind that at last Slippery
Slim was going to have a pair of human bloodhounds
on his trail such as all his ingenuity and
vindictiveness combined could not throw into
the discard.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me have,” he went on to say to Jack, “as
good a description as possible of those same
bills your friend Scotty found in that pocketbook
dropped among his clothing by the unknown
party whom you believe was looking for
your letter of instructions from Washington.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When Jack complied with this request the
other nodded his head approvingly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question but what they were of the same
stripe as all the others that have been brought to
our attention,” he told Jack. “You must know
it’s been a mooted question as to whether the
plates from which these notes are being printed
in vast quantities (that make it a gold mine for
the gang) are counterfeits engraved by some
master in the art or stolen property, which have
somehow never been missed by the plant where
much of the printing is done for the Treasury
Department—the bills are so perfect that cashiers
and tellers are all at sea over the facts, so
that something of a near panic has resulted in
banking circles as a result of this unknown quantity.
Remember these are the old type of banknotes,
and not the new abbreviated form of currency,
so that it is more difficult to discover the
actual facts.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will all come out in the wash, sir,” remarked
Perk, sagaciously, with a sly wink at
his pal.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, Perk,” observed the gentlemanly official,
smilingly; “but I’m more concerned about
your plan of campaign than anything else right
now. During the time you stop over here in
Orleans I mean to keep you posted with regard
to any fresh news that comes in to Headquarters
for there is hardly a day when we do not learn
of additional discoveries connected with this deluge
of phony money that’s been dumped on the
whole Southwest by this hard working gang.
I am telling you everything that’s known or suspected,
so that you can figure out your best line
of action.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We understand that, Mr. Adkins,” said Jack,
nodding, “and you can rest assured we appreciate
your kindness more than I can tell you.
Before we jump off you will know what we’ve
decided to do, so as to pick up a warm trail;
and after that, sir, don’t be worried if you fail
to hear a single word from us for days, weeks,
or even months; but depend upon it we’ll be
working on the job every minute.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And never forget, I beg of you, that this
man is a devil for cruelty and craftiness—I’m
sure you’ll not delude yourselves that his arrest
will be an easy task; for as good men as were
ever on the roll of our Secret Service Department
have fallen down on the job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you again, sir, for your warning; but
we’re not meaning to feel anything like over-confidence,
so as to let the bars down. I understand
from my having been picked to take up
this case, that the knowledge of myself and my
assistant here along the line of aviation cut a big
figure in the appointment, since it has been
learned that Slim himself makes use of a flying
boat possibly to cross over from the wilds of
Mexico, it being suspected he has his plant
hidden away somewhere among the mountains,
where he doubtless keeps peace with the authorities
by paying tribute that insures his being left
undisturbed. We hope to change all that sooner
or later, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I admire your modesty, Jack,” continued the
Government official, who had warmed toward
the pair during the short time he had known
them, and seemed to take a personal interest in
their fortunes. “Remember to keep in touch
with Headquarters while in the city, so as to
notify me in case you need any assistance—I can
later on place a posse of oldtime Texas Rangers
at your service, if the occasion arises for a necessity
to show force—they are now working for
the Government as border patrols, and as you
can understand, are the same rough-riding, fearless
type that played such a leading figure in
the early history of the Lone Star State; for we
have authority that covers such matters. And
I’ll be one of the first to extend you my hearty
congratulations should you win out, and bring
in your man; as I’ve no doubt your good pal
here used to do when, as you’ve told me, he used
to work with the Canadian Mounted Police
force, in years gone by.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It won’t be our fault, sir, if we make a flop
o’ the job,” asserted Perk, who believed he ought
to get in an occasional word; although there
were a good many things he did not wholly
understand, and which he would depend on
Jack to further explain when opportunity arose.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins shook them both cordially by the
hand, and took his departure, leaving them to
digest all the startling facts he had placed in
their possession. By slow degrees they would
figure things out, and sketch their plan of operation;
then would come the hour when once more
they must depend on their wings to carry them
many hundreds of miles toward the scene of
action, where the air would be surcharged with
dynamite, while deadly enemies might be lying
in ambush, ready to take them by surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk started to spring his questions, and Jack
was only too glad to make the necessary explanations;
for it was necessary that they work in
complete harmony if they hoped to be successful.</p>

<p class='c013'>As far as they had gone, things looked hopeful
to Jack, as he marshalled the facts that had
lately been placed in their possession. He was
satisfied that when every item had been arranged
in its rightful sequence they could fashion a
plan of campaign that would at least have a
better chance for winning out than any of those
utilized by former detectives, who had not possessed
the essential wings so as to meet Slippery
Slim on his own chosen ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No tellin’ just how long we’ll stick it out in
this burgh, I guess, buddy?” suggested Perk,
some time later, as they continued to take things
easy, resting up after a hard night’s flight, and
meaning to get around the city after noon and
lunch time had come and passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Couldn’t say as yet, Perk; we’ve got to comb
out the stuff as handed over by our new friend,
Mr. Adkins, and discard everything that doesn’t
pan out as being worth while. Then there were
a few leaders he dropped that, if followed up,
might turn out to be leading clues, the possession
of which would possibly turn the tide of battle.
I’m meaning not to let anything make me show
undue speed—Rome wasn’t built in a day, we’ve
got to recollect, and so shape things from the
standpoint of ‘safety first’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! that’s the boy!” gurgled the pleased
Perk; “me, don’t I remember that story o’ the
hare an’ the tortoise runnin’ a race, which the
turtle won ’cause he never even stopped to rest
up; while the rabbit, thinkin’ he could run loops
around such a plodder, lay down to take a nap,
overslept himself, and when he got to the goal
there was Old Leatherback awaitin’ to turn the
big laugh on him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk wound up with one of his rollicking
laughs; everything seemed to create merriment
in his soul just now, after that royal breakfast;
though perhaps he was running away ahead of
the dry facts, and counting his chickens before
they were hatched out of the shell. But Perk
was confident the sly fox of a Slim would find
himself snagged in the net one of these days,
and the clever guy who handled things would
turn out to be an aviator and sky detective named
Jack Ralston.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack some time afterwards, had just aroused
from a short nap, when Perk, who had been
pondering and grumbling to himself, tossed out
another question, as if to disclose what was
troubling him:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it, old hoss, do you b’lieve them
dicks we left behind after they’d floated down
from a high ceilin’ with their chutes, got outen
the scrape, so they could a hiked to some nearby
village or town, an’ took the first train headed
for Orleans, reckonin’ we must a’been on the
jump thisaways?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say the chances all point that way, Perk,”
Jack told him, without the slightest hesitation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jumpin’ crickets! if that’s a fact why, a feller
might run acrost the slick pair any old minute—meet
’em right face to face!” Perk went on to
say, as if the fact gave him more or less concern.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose then you’d recognize the chappies
with just one look, eh, what about that, partner?”
asked Jack, laughingly; at which the other
grinned a bit foolishly, to admit he had serious
doubts on that score.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! didn’t either o’ us get a peep-in at
their monikers, worse luck—had them helmets
and goggles in place right away, like they didn’t
mean to give us a single look-in. S’pose now
they got the high sign on us boys?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“On a venture I’d say that was always possible,”
replied Jack, soberly; for this very point
had occurred to him, and was as yet unsettled
in his mind. “Nobody knows how long they may
have been in Atlanta—Mr. Adkins assured us
Slim seemed to have all sorts of strings out, so
as to learn in advance of any bunch of Government
agents taking the field against his giant
bogus money monopoly; and for all we can tell
those two may have been spying on us most
of the time we were around Candler Field, getting
our ship ready to take to the air.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rotten luck, I’m sayin’, and too much one-sided
to suit me,” growled Perk, frowning savagely.
“Here we got to do our work in the
dark; while that smart cuss holds all the high
cards in the pack, an’ c’n trump our ace any
time he takes a notion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No need to worry about that, comrade,” said
Jack, soothingly. “You must remember that
when we move along we mean to disappear as
if heading into the thickest belt of pea soup fog
ever seen—in that way they’ll lose all trace of
us, and we can play our cards as we choose, making
up for a different breed of sky travelers, so
as to dope the cleverest kind of spies he can send
out. While they’re left guessing what’s become
of us we’ll be doing our little tracking job, and
hour by hour, day after day, keep on creeping
closer to their secret stronghold, wherever that
may prove to be. Those are some of the things
we figured on doing, Perk, don’t forget.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The one addressed made no reply, but as he
let his head fall back, as if he meant to pick up
a few winks of sleep, there came a look of rapt
admiration on his weather-beaten face that bespoke
the utmost confidence in his best pal.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c014'>CHAPTER X <br /> <br />LAYING PLANS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>After a noonday lunch Jack and his partner
spent most of the afternoon in carrying out the
various duties that were seemingly on their program.
Among other things Jack visited the
Federal building, and was closeted for more
than an hour with Mr. Adkins.</p>

<p class='c013'>The latter official had conceived a great fancy
for young Ralston, and went to no end of trouble
so as to post him with regard to what he was
likely to run up against while endeavoring to
close in on Slippery Slim. With his accustomed
sagacity Jack made notes of some of the
facts thus laid before him; but since these were
in shorthand, and would be utterly unintelligible
to any outside party, should they chance
to fall into enemy hands, there was no danger
that any mischief would follow.</p>

<p class='c013'>By degrees he was filling up with scraps of
description, and everything connected with
former attempts at locating the hideout, where
all this unlawful scrip was being turned off the
press, to flood the Southwest.</p>

<p class='c013'>That was always his way of doing—when
given a tough job Jack would live alongside it,
breathing the very atmosphere of the undertaking,
until he found himself sympathetic with the
aims and ambitions of the criminals whose apprehension
was placed on his shoulders by his
Big Boss.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll have dinner early, Perk,” he told the
other, who had been carrying out a number of
special duties while Jack was busy elsewhere,
“so as to retire to our room at the hotel. No
going out after nightfall for us just at present,
especially in a strange city, where some sneak
might waylay us coming back from the theater.
All that sort of pleasure must be put out of our
heads just at present.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! guess you’re hittin’ the nail on the
head, old hoss, when you say that,” grunted
Perk, who very probably had already picked out
just the screen play he wanted so badly to see;
but he was a good scout, and able to put duty
above pleasure, when the occasion arose for
making a personal sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another thing,” continued Jack, “there’s no
telling what night flying we’re bound to be up
against, in trying to keep our movements secret;
so it’d be wise for us both to enjoy all the extra
sleep that comes our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, partner,” assented Perk, subordinating
his desires to the slogan which he knew
was Jack’s watchword—“safety first”. “When
I’ve stowed away all the grub I c’n hold mebbe
I’ll be ready to hit the hay, to stick it out till
cock-crow around daylight—an’ then some.
Pretty fair sleeper, they always called me across
the big pond—crawl out as the last horn was
blowin’, rub my eyes a bit, get aboard my fightin’
crate, an’ step off to knock another Heine pilot
down afore botherin’ ’bout my breakfast—all in a
day’s doings with Gabe Perkiser. Sabbe that,
partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I know you like a book,” Jack told him
with a smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get a bellyfull when you had that confab
with Mr. Adkins?” demanded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m filled up to the brim with all kinds of
material, which by degrees I’ll have to sort out,
keeping only what strikes me as essential,” came
the answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see—sorter separatin’ the chaff from the
wheat,” mused Perk; “an’ if it’s a fair question,
old hoss, which way do we head when we take
off?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You might call it due northeast,” Jack told
him; and then, as his companion uttered a
startled exclamation, as though vastly surprised,
Jack gave a quick glance around as if to make
certain that no one was dogging their footsteps,
after which he lowered his voice almost to a
whisper, to add: “but that would be only for a
<i>blind</i>, in case hostile eyes were watching our
departure from the flying field; for after we’ve
cleared a dozen or more miles we can make a
complete circle, and point the nose of our boat
squarely west!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good boy!” snapped the relieved Perk;
“sounds a heap more like it. You sure did
throw a big scare into me, Jack, ’cause it’d been
’bout settled ’tween us that the game had ought
to be played out there in the boundless waste
spaces around the border.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, everything points that way so far,” he
was assured; “but no more talkie at present,
Perk—we’ll keep bottled up until inside four
walls, where no spy can steal our thunder.
Slim’s knocked the underpinning away from a
bunch of fine schemes looking to his undoing,
simply by finding out what the big game happened
to be, and then bursting the bubble by a
scoop. We don’t intend to dish our business
that way if it can be helped.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wall,” drawled Perk, with his best Yankee
effect, “guess not if we know our stuff, an’ c’n
roll our hoop.”</p>

<p class='c013'>As they walked along toward their hotel Perk
kept up a constant lookout, as though endeavoring
to make some more or less thrilling discovery—never
a man, black or white, did they meet
but that he was made the object of a severe
scrutiny by the suspicious one; however, they
reached their objective without his having run
across any reason for making a decision; and
shortly afterwards they were securely lodged in
their room, the door locked, and a couple of easy
chairs inviting them to take things comfortable,
which they lost no time in doing, being wearied
from so much trotting about—flying men as a
rule not enjoying a reputation for pedestrian
feats.</p>

<p class='c013'>A long and serious confab followed, both
speaking in low tones; Jack on his part explained
the mass of information he had accumulated,
and answered the flood of questions asked
by his comrade, as well as he was able; until he
found a chance to go deeper into things himself
he could not make definite statements concerning
a number of points that were a bit hazy, and
needed confirmation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus the afternoon waned, and the time came
when they were ready to think of the essential
“eats”. Of course it was Perk who brought this
subject up, for he chanced to have a tremendous
appetite, and was apt to give considerable time
to figuring what his next <i>menu</i> would be—indeed,
half the enjoyment in his estimation lay in
thus building air castles along the line of “grub”.</p>

<p class='c013'>Remembering that little episode up in Atlanta,
where some unknown party had made such
a “rat’s nest” of Scotty’s adjoining room, evidently
under a mistaken belief it belonged to
himself and Perk, Jack made sure to carry all
his important papers on his person, properly secured,
so that no deft hand of a sneak thief could
negotiate their abstraction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All ready, partner,” he told Perk, at the time
looking out of the window, holding back the
curtains to see the better who chanced to be
walking along the opposite pavement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never said sweeter words than them, old
boy; I sure was close to faintin’, my tummy
feelin’ like the bottom was adroppin’ out—soup
an’ such soft stuffs, while fillin’ at the time don’t
stay with me any great while—I crave solids
mostly. On your way then, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had marshalled all the facts that had
been placed in his possession, weeded a few out
as worthless, and by the time their discussion
ended had told his companion that the Finger
of Destiny was pointing out their future course
as lying over the almost boundless plains of
Texas, across New Mexico, and deep into Arizona
deserts, to the wild country along the border
not far distant from the spot at which the
Gila river forms a junction with the larger Colorado;
where the latter serves as a watery boundary
line between Arizona and Southeastern California,
with Old Mexico less than thirty miles
distant as the crow flies.</p>

<p class='c013'>It would be a big jump for them, but the flood
of bad currency undoubtedly had its start somewhere
in this hostile region, and spread out like
an open fan, northwest into San Diego and Los
Angeles—northward up to Salt Lake City—and
in the northeast as far as Oklahoma. To
effectually break it up it was necessary that they
go to the fountain head, so as to destroy the very
roots of the noisome poison ivy plant.</p>

<p class='c013'>They spent more than half an hour dining,
and needless to say Perk enjoyed himself to his
heart’s content—who wouldn’t if he had a pocketfull
of ready cash, furnished by a bountiful
Uncle Sam; a bill of fare bristling with all kinds
of tempting dishes such as Perk doted on; and
to complete the combination having been born
with a healthy, unbridled appetite?</p>

<p class='c013'>It was just commencing to get dusk when they
emerged from the restaurant and started back to
the hotel, some two blocks distant. Perk, as
usual, kept turning his head this way and that
very much like a wolf scalp-hunter looking for
his suspicious quarry. Presently he picked at
Jack’s sleeve, and bending his head until his lips
almost touched the other’s ear he observed in a
sibilant whisper!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen, partner—we got a clam doggin’ us
like a bloodhound on the track o’ a runaway nigger
from a convict camp back in Alabam—get
that, do you?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c014'>CHAPTER XI <br /> <br />THE NIGHT ALARM</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“I’m not thrilled by what you say, Perk, because
I’ve been more than half expecting to hear
that discovery. Glad you got on to him okay;
because it’s always best to know what’s in the
wind. What sort of a chap is he like?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack spoke in his usual calm way, and the other
realized he had undoubtedly been prepared for
the sudden news.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ out o’ the way ’bout his looks, far as
I c’n see,” was Perk’s reply; “on’y got a few
squints at the guy; but he’s keepin’ tab o’ our
movements I guess now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Reckon he might be one of those lads in the
Ryan ship that crashed in flames after they’d
flown the coop?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! just can’t be dead sure, partner,”
chuckled Perk; “but there’s somethin’ ’bout his
walk that gets me into believin’ he’s the <i>kiwi</i>
that pilot was keepin’ on our tail so long, stickin’
like a leech from a mud-hole.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder,” the other went on to say, as if
talking to himself; “if that’s the case then, both
those duffers pulled through with their lives, and
not so badly hurt. Honestly I’m a bit glad that’s
so, for up to the present I’ve never had occasion
to take a human life.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk snorted on hearing this.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if so be you’d been ten years older, my
boy, mebbe you’d not be able to say that—chances
are you’d a been mixed up in that mess across the
Atlantic, when Yanks an’ Johnny Rebs were
fightin’ shoulder to shoulder, and it was a case o’
a Heine pilot’s life or our’n. But if you keep
on with Uncle Sam’s service as you’re adoin’
right now, the time’ll come for you to fetch back
a dead man who jest <i>wouldn’t</i> let hisself be captured.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like as not,” remarked Jack; “but there’s no
need of crossing a river till you come to it; so
I’m not taking trouble by the forelock away
ahead of time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’ll we do ’bout this dickey bird that’s
bobbin’ at our heels so gaily, tell me, partner?”
pursued Perk, eagerly, as though in his fighting
heart he was actually hoping his superior would
give the order to turn on their persistent pursuer,
and at least blacken both his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! nothing at all, Perk; let him run his
rope; only we’ll keep along streets where there’s
plenty of company, and be prepared for any sort
of ambush; though I can’t believe he’d be crazy
enough to start anything so early in the evening—if
the hour was close to midnight, things
might be different. There are any number of
tough cases in this old Creole city ready to handle
a sticking game for the coin in it—blacks and
yellows and whites it doesn’t matter which—all
of them are assassins at heart.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then you don’t care if he shadows us straight
to the hotel?” demanded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Much good that will do him.” said Jack with
a light laugh; “the chances are two to one he
already knows where we’ve put up, and has had
some spy dog me to the Federal building. When
the time comes for us to jump off we’ll find a
slick way to hop our ship without giving these
boys a show-down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently they arrived at the hotel entrance,
without any untoward incident arising to mar
the quiet of the evening. Perk cast a parting
glance toward their rear just before entering,
and seeing the shadowy figure hovering not far
away, considered it a part of his duty to place
his thumb to his nose, and wiggle his fingers
derisively, at the same time uttering a snarl like
a bobcat at bay, to express his utter contempt.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once in their room, Jack first of all cast about
as if to decide whether any uninvited guest had
intruded on their preserves while they were absent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything seems to be just as we left it,”
he told his running mate, after making this little
survey, “and even if some busybody did get in
here with the aid of a pass-key borrowed from a
chambermaid, he was shrewd enough not to mess
things up like they did with our friend Scotty
of the air mail bunch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess now they must acome to the conclusion
you keep the letter o’ instructions ’bout your
person,” suggested Perk, wisely, “which, bein’
the case mebbe now they figger on sneakin’ in
here while we’re sound asleep, an’ agoin’ through
your clothes in regulation style. They do tell me
there be sneak thieves right clever in this same
burgh, equal to the ones out in India, where they
c’n steal the sheet from under a sleeper, without
wakin’ him up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I understand that’s really true, partner,” Jack
agreed; “but we’re not going to let them have
half a chance, even if they hired all the crooks
in New Orleans to play the game.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sounds good to me, boss,” Perk declared.
“We’ll manage to sleep with one eye open, an’
if any critter tries to give us the once over, he’ll
wish he’d never been born, that’s all I know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Before turning in, Jack placed a chair so nicely
balanced that in case of the door being ever so
slightly opened it would crash to the floor, making
enough noise to arouse the Seven Sleepers.
Perk grinned at seeing him prepare this “guardian
angel” as he termed it, and lost no time himself
in “hitting the hay.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Some time later in the night, when outside
noises had almost died away, there came a loud
clatter that awoke both the sleepers instantly.
They bounced out on the floor in their pajamas,
with Jack pulling the cord he had attached to
the electric bulb, so that the room was magically
illuminated.</p>

<p class='c013'>The chair lay on its side, and just beyond Perk
could see that their door was partly open; the
key had been left in the lock, but skillful fingers
must have manipulated it by means of
slender-jawed pliers, showing the touch of a professional
thief.</p>

<p class='c013'>Straight toward the door the form of Perk was
projected—a hungry lion could hardly have
made a more pronounced leap at some four-legged
game which he had been stalking.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tearing open the door still wider, Perk thrust
out his head, and looked up and down the hotel
corridor. He fancied he could make out a dim
figure far along the poorly lighted hall, but it
vanished like a phantom even as he stared, evidently
turning some corner.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there were other sounds arising—doors
all along the corridor were opening, and heads
being projected, showing how the startling alarm
had awakened numerous other sleepers, who
may have imagined an earthquake was in process
of occurring, though such a happening was utterly
foreign to the metropolis on the Lower Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c013'>Voices, too, were heard, from both masculine
as well as feminine sources, as the aroused hotel
guests endeavored to fathom the real meaning
of the row.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, seeing there was nothing doing, closed
the door, and locked it again; after which he
turned to his companion who had been watching
his actions with more or less amusement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Consarn his picture,” growled the old fighter;
“he got off scot free; I jest glimpsed him
aturnin’ the first bend down the hall. Blamed
shame I couldn’t come to grips with the yeller
cub—I’d a given a heap to twist his neck
some, you bet I would. Mebbe now I’d otter sit
up the rest o’ the night to make certain, eh,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not the slightest need of such a thing, partner,”
Jack assured him. “I’ll fix that door so it
won’t be opened again in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c013'>With that he again took the stout chair, and
placed it diagonally against the door, so that its
top rested just under the knob; after that had
been accomplished it must needs be a battering-ram
that could burst in on them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not content with that, Jack went to each of
the two windows, thrust out his head to examine
for the second time the face of the outer wall of
the building so as to make sure there was no
ledge wide enough to give a would-be trespasser
foothold.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not the ghost of a chance for the most nimble
thief to get in by way of a window, Perk, so
back to bed we go, and sleep like babes in the
wood for we’re in the third story and far enough
from a fire escape to be secure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk grinned and nodded acquiescence; truth
to tell he was not at all averse to starting all over
again—possibly the rude interruption had disturbed
him just when he was starting to partake
of a royal feast that covered every one of his most
beloved dishes and he was hugging the delusion
to his heart that if given another chance history
might repeat itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>At least there was no further alarm, and the
night passed into oblivion like all its countless
predecessors with the rising sun arousing the
two comrades, and Perk as usual singing out
that he felt as though he could easily manage two
customary breakfasts in that delighful restaurant
where they were already feeling so much at
home.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c014'>CHAPTER XII <br /> <br />PLAYING WITH FIRE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>During the morning Jack took a taxi and paid
another visit to the offices in the government
building where Mr. Adkins had his desk, doing
his daily stunt under the direction of the U. S.
District Attorney and other officials in the service
of Uncle Sam.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, also, had his job laid out for him, which
was to circulate around until he felt positive he
had thrown off any possible spy after which it
was his duty to make certain purchases, following
the list Jack had given him, have them all
sent to the aviation field in charge of the man
Mr. Adkins had placed on guard at the hangar
containing their ship and thus completing the
stock of supplies necessary for their long flight
and survey work.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk carried out his instructions to the letter,
and with great vim, since the fact of their laying
in these stores was a positive indication that
things were coming to pass insuring a speedy
getaway and <i>Action</i> was what had come to be
the greatest asset in life to Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>They met again at noon in their eating place,
where, choosing an isolated corner table they
could discuss their plan of campaign, even while
attending to the wants of the inner man.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk made his report, which the other seemed
to find good, judging from his frequent nods of
acquiescence and when the story had been told
to the last word, Perk felt it was his turn to
learn things.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess now you got the last batch o’ information
from His Nibs, Jack?” he hastened to
ask, expectantly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sure did, partner,” he was told. “A few
scraps of fresh news that’d be likely to interest
us had drifted in since I saw Mr. Adkins last,
which he passed along to me. I’ll sort these
shreds over later, and fix them where they belong.
So far as I can see now they corroborate
what we’ve already been so strongly believing
must be a fact.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which means, I guess, boss, we head west?”
ventured Perk, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Into the setting sun—that’s right, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do we still expect to keep in touch with Mr.
Adkins, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whenever the chance opens up, and we have
any important news to send along or want to
know certain things, perhaps even to call on him
for that bunch of old-time Texas Rangers he
said he could turn over to us if we found any
use for them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be!” said Perk, plainly excited, “I
sure do hope that emergency does bob up, ’cause
I’d give my last Mex dollar to glimpse them
rearin’, tearin’ ole fighters knockin’ spots outen
the bunch o ’lawless ringers Slippery Slim’s
gathered around him. Chances are they’d skip
out like hot fleas soon as they heard the ol’time
battle cry o’ the defenders o’ the Rio Grande in
the days when cattle rustlers raided the ranches
down Texas way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But we’ve got to remember,” cautioned
Jack, “that these chaps are like lean hungry
wolves, that never leave the trail of a wounded
stag as long as they can crawl along. I’m not
fancying we’ve pulled the wool over their eyes
so far and that fact was brought to my attention
just after I got back from conferring with
Mr. Adkins.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As how, boss?” queried the curious Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t just know what influenced me after
I’d entered the hotel, to step back and look out
again,” explained Jack. “There was the driver
of my taxi, the trusty who’d been recommended
by the clerk at the desk, talking earnestly with
an unknown party and even as I watched I saw
him thrust a bank note into the chauffeur’s itching
hand, showing that he has been corrupted
and is in cohoot with our enemies.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! is it so rotten bad as all that, partner?”
bleated the disgusted Perk, “All I c’n
say is I sure do hope it was a nice brand new five-dollar
bill he handed over to the yeller dog, an’
that it’s agoin’ to turn out to be a sample o’ their
bogus money outfit. Serve the slick renegade if
he got hisself pulled in for passin’ a counterfeit
note on some guy that ain’t goin’ to sit by and
take what’s comin’ to him without raisin’ a nice
howl.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t be too vindictive, Perk,” Jack told
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, partner, ever see the boob afore?” the
other demanded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you mean the chap who was pumping my
driver for all that was out, Perk, I can’t say
that I have. He was a flashily dressed man,
with loud clothes that would stamp him as a
gambler, like those who used to travel on these
Mississippi River steamboats in the old days before
the Civil War, fleecing unsuspecting passengers
out of all their money and I haven’t
the least doubt but what he’s a member of the
very gang we’re expecting to round up. Mr.
Adkins told me it was simply amazing the vastness
of the combine Slippery Slim’s managed to
gather around him but he was certain it must
number many scores of workers, all obeying the
orders of the mainspring—crooked Slim Garrabrant.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! the more you keep on tellin’ me them
big stories, Jack, the happier it all makes me
’cause I seem to just know there’s bound to be a
heap o’ rough house stuff croppin’ up, to cool
my blood, ragin’ hot just now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some fine day you’ll be rubbing up against
enough fighting to make you call quits with the
game. Perk, my boy; and it’s just likely to crop
up before long if indications count for anything.
I felt pretty sure from his swagger that
this fellow might be the very same master mind
in charge of that Ryan boat—then, too, when he
walked away he had a little limp, which might
have come from striking the ground so hard
after his chute let him down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Darned pity he didn’t break a leg, or even
his measly ol’ neck, I’d say,” grumbled Perk, one
of his fits of resentment gripping him just then.
“Got no use for these treacherous snakes that
squirm, and worm their way into the confidence
o’ honest gents, on’y to play a low-down trick,
an’ fill their pockets with smackers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s one thing we’ve got to guard
against,” suggested Jack, who seemed to have a
faculty for looking at every side of a picture,
and anticipating troubles that might never have
occurred to others less gifted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As what, partner?” asked Perk, brightening
up once more.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Delay is what they may be hoping for—some
way to hold us here while important news is
carried to headquarters. I can even see how
they might make some sort of ridiculous charge
against us to the police, in hopes we would be
held several days under suspicion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk looked astonished.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But see here, boss, we got our credentials
from Washington to prove we’re in the Secret
Service, an’ sky detectives at that; they jest
wouldn’t dare hold us on some sorter flimsy
charge ’cause that’d get ’em in hard with the
Government, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never know how these affairs may turn
out,” said Jack. “Often there seems to be some
kind of a jealous feeling between States officers
and those of the Government—almost like a little
vendetta, each arm of the Law striking out
at the other, and getting in a sly lick that’s good
for a laugh after hostilities have died down.
These Southern city police might make out
there was a grave charge of abduction or something
like that, compelling them to hold us <i>incommunicado</i>—that
is keep us from intercourse
with the U. S. District Attorney’s office until
several days had elapsed and then setting us
free with a lot of apologies that didn’t mean anything
whatsoever.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! I get your drift partner,” said Perk,
frowning. “We sure can’t afford to spend any
of our valuable time in the hoosgow here, if we
c’n help it. ’Cause things set that way I hope
you get busy an’ fix it so we’ll shake the dust o’
this same burgh off our shoes in a hurry. Got
the date settled yet, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shook hands with, and said goodbye to Mr.
Adkins this morning, Perk and you are at
liberty to figure that out as you please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it’s <i>tonight</i>?” asked the other, looking
well satisfied with such an enticing programme.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wind and weather permitting we’ll clear out
soon after twilight settles down on the city and
the river,” Jack assured his understudy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me, I’m sittin’ pretty, an’ taking things as
they come along, old hoss,” continued Perk.
“Let’s perambulate and attend to the crying
needs of this high noon hour—the girl told me
they expected to have apple dumplings for lunch
today an’ that’s one I’d nominate as bein’ among
my prime favorites—you know I got a <i>few</i> I
really enjoy an’ that’s no lie either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I know a good many on your list—fact
is,” said frank Jack, “if I ran down the whole
menu this noon there’d be only a scant few that’s
missed being called your especial favorites each
in its turn as the wind blew. But just as well
we did all the eating while the chance lasts, for
only a magician can tell what our bill of fare is
going to be during the coming week or two—some
weird dishes most likely—boiled owl,
fried rattlesnake, baked prairie dog—Heaven
knows to what ends we may be reduced.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have a heart, partner, don’t take my healthy
appetite away by mentionin’ them terrible
dishes. ’Member you promised we’d hire a taxi
after lunch, an’ drive all around the city, lampin’
the big sights like the French market, the queer
buryin’ places where holes in thick walls take
the place o’ graves, on ’count o’ there bein’ so
much water in the ground, with the city settin’
so low down, an’ the ol’ Mississippi on one o’
its benders. Then I want to eat Gulf oysters
an’ shrimp at one o’ them cute little stands we
noticed yesterday afternoon; try a reg’lar Creole
dinner tonight at that place Mr. Adkins told us
about—after which I’m all done with Orleans,
an’ ready to pull up stakes for keeps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll keep that to the last, Perk, and go to
the flying field from the eating house by taxi.
From that time on we’ll have to depend on our
own heads and hands to keep us out of difficulties.
But let’s hope we can climb up to a three
thousand foot ceiling, and strike out as if we
were aiming for Savannah or Jacksonville, only
to swing around inside of half an hour, climb
high over the city and river and put for the
Texas border at full speed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This enchanting program gave Perk much
cause for rejoicing and he sat down at their regular
table in the restaurant feeling, as he expressed
it, “happy as a clam at high tide” and
full of little laughs that seemed to gurgle up
from his shoes.</p>

<p class='c013'>They chatted of other happenings, not wishing
to “talk shop” in such a crowded place, lest
listening ears pick up certain information that
could be used greatly to their disadvantage—Perk
had an endless fund of interesting reminiscences
that, told in his inimitable fashion,
were a never failing source of joy to the appreciative
air pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was spent in motoring all
around the most interesting portions of the city,
the obliging Mr. Adkins having made out a list
of subjects they should not miss seeing while on
this first visit to the justly famous Louisiana metropolis.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIII <br /> <br />THE HOP-OFF</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Leaving the hotel, after settling their account,
and still making use of the taxi with its accommodating
driver, Jack and his comrade had
taken what small amount of hand luggage they
possessed along with them, not meaning to come
back again.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins had recommended a small but
unique restaurant run by a buxom French madame,
where they could have a Creole supper,
such as would long haunt their memories as a
genuine treat and it was to this place they ordered
their driver to convey them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both of them felt fairly convinced they had
been shadowed during the afternoon, although
so carefully must this have been accomplished
they had no positive proof to make it what Perk
would term a “dead certainty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They really did have a delightful “feed,” and
the dishes set before them were as a rule complete
mysteries although the obliging madame,
seeing they were tasting her triumphs of the
French <i>chef’s</i> art for the first time, gladly explained
the nature of the food they consumed
with so much gusto.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was fascinated with his supper, and inwardly
vowed that this should not be the last time
he would partake of tasty Creole dishes. This
duty fulfilled, they faced the next progressive
step in their night’s program—making for
the aviation field, and boarding their ship for
a speedy takeoff, their ultimate goal neither of
them could say just where, save that if all went
well they expected to be somewhere along the
California border within the next few days.</p>

<p class='c013'>The taxi was waiting, with the chauffeur on
the alert. He had already been advised of the
fact that they anticipated having some parties
attempt to spy upon them as evening settled
down and on this account he had maintained a
strict watch for troublesome visitors who might
even attempt to threaten him with bodily injury
unless he agreed to enter into their plans for
delaying the flight of the two flyers, as he knew
his passengers to be from what he had been told.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I see our taxi’s still on deck, partner,”
observed Perk, just as if he might have suspected
they would find it missing, with a detail of grim
city police waiting to escort them to the lockup,
they to be held in durance vile until serious
charges against them could be sifted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing came along to bother you, Henri?”
asked Jack of the smiling driver, who laughed
as he said in reply:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I haf seen one beeg hulk of ze man hanging
around, M’sieu, and looking as if he would like
to eat me up but me, I haf been an old soldier
in the Grand Army of France, and I think he did
not like the way I throw my chest out thees way,
and walk as eef I am on guard duty; he did not
address a single word to me, but just a little
while ago he disappear—I think he may haf
gone to get more courage out of ze glass.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good boy, Henri,” said the grinning Perk,
clapping a hand on the stalwart chauffeur’s
shoulder; “for myself I should not like to tackle
you when you have your fighting face all set.
Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So they were off, and heading out in the direction
of the aviation grounds, with the first shadows
of approaching evening gathering around
them. Perk may have been more or less nervous,
in anticipation of something coming to pass that
would seriously cripple their plans for a speedy
flight, since he kept turning his head from side
to side and scrutinizing every one they saw upon
the streets they traversed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Henri maintained a fairly good speed, all the
law would permit, so that few cars passed them
on the road. Perk managed to watch closely,
and never a motor came booming along in their
wake, honking to announce the driver’s intention
to pass by, than he had his eyes glued on the car
and continued to pay strict attention until it
had crept well up ahead.</p>

<p class='c013'>But after all nothing out of the way came to
pass, and eventually they reached the aviation
field where they found lights already in play,
since a delayed air mail ship was hovering over
signaling for better illumination. There was
some small damage in regard to the steering
gear, making it a bit risky to try a landing unless
the field was brilliantly lighted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You made an arrangement with a couple of
the ground force to hang around so as to help
us get the crate out okay, didn’t you, Perk?”
queried Jack, as they drew up close to the particular
hangar where they had seen their plane
placed in quarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, I sure did, Jack,” the other replied.
“Must be they’re over where that crate hanging
overhead means to land—somethin’ wrong mebbe
but they gimme their word to stay around
till we got here—there, I c’n lamp the guys
runnin’ thisaways right now, so it’s okay, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I see them coming,” returned the other,
himself a bit relieved, since the intended departure
was a most important episode in their plans,
and to meet with any sort of a setback would
be most aggravating indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The two mechanicians quickly arrived, the
hanger was unlocked and opened so as to permit
the exit of the ship. First of all both flyers
hastened to don their working togs, then fasten
on the ’chutes with the harness necessary for the
purpose, all working smoothly and finally clapping
their helmets on their heads, with the earflaps
secured to keep things in readiness for any
emergency that might crop up.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being accomplished, Jack gave the word
to have the heavy ship dragged out into the open.
He knew that his assistant would have looked
after everything essential to their comfort during
the coming flight for Perk was one of those
dependable fellows who carry out orders with
machine-like regularity.</p>

<p class='c013'>A few parties had hastened up to see what
was going on but so far as Perk could tell they
were either workers connected with the field, or
else visitors from the city, who had lingered to
watch the landing of the air mail, so as to tell
how it was done when they reached their several
homes, to partake of a late supper.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now the ship had been swung around so as
to head into the west, since the soft evening breeze
was coming from that quarter and everything
seemed in readiness for the take-off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, still surveying his surroundings as if
still cherishing a fragment of his former suspicions
that all might not be as lovely as surface
indications would announce, started to climb
aboard. Jack on his part was handing some
money to the two men, not wishing to leave a
single thing unpaid when passing out from New
Orleans—there was nothing to be done about
their use of the hangar, since Mr. Adkins had
assured him that matter had already been taken
care of, regardless of how long they chose to
linger in the Crescent City.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, too, cast a last glance around, just as he
would have done had he still been with the air
mail service and about to start off on his customary
night flight with the north-bound sacks
of letters and the express matter that vent along.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then he heard Perk give vent to a hurried
exclamation:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get aboard, partner; I guess the measly critters
are acomin’ down on us like hot cakes right
now. Lookit how they start arunnin’ thisaway,
will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did not bother looking, as every second
might be valuable; he climbed aboard with alacrity,
and settled down in his seat; at the same time
calling out to the helpers to stand aside. Then
he pulled the gun, with the motor responding
instantly, so well had Perk done his work when
checking up the ship that morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was still glueing his eyes on the several
figures now racing madly in their general direction,
and waving their arms wildly; no doubt
they had started to shout in addition, but the
descending air mail crate was making more or
less racket, which, added to by their own motor’s
thunder, prevented any one from hearing what
they may have been whooping.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was trembling with an excess of emotion—evidently
they had just escaped “by the
skin of their teeth,” for he felt certain he could
distinguish the uniforms of the police in the
little bunch of runners.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Played your hand just a mite too late, gents!”
Perk was whooping as he in turn waved a mocking
adieu backward; “thought you’d ketch a
weasel asleep, I guess, but not so easy, you gate
crashers. Wow! here we go spinnin’ along like
the wind, and it’s goodnight to the bunch. Huh!
shootin’ at us, air you—jest awastin’ ammunition,
that’s all, boys. Go ’way back an’ sit down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Jack lifted her in an upward fling, and
they were off like a startled hawk!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIV <br /> <br />SKIRTING THE GULF</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There was some shooting going on back there,
for although of course the watchful Perk failed
to catch the sound of discharges of guns, he did
see flash after flash, proclaiming that the police,
under the impression that important criminals
were beating them to it, wished to show
their warlike spirit by such a bombardment.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the flying missiles came anywhere near the
ascending plane that fact was not manifest to the
two occupants of the cockpit; their movements
must have been too speedy for such an attack to
be successful and almost immediately they had
risen beyond the danger line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was feeling vastly relieved, for it would
have been a bad beginning of their special mission
were they detained for days in the Southern
city, while the agents of the great counterfeit
league held the upper hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>He could see with the last glimpse he had of
the aviation field that all this lively accompaniment
to their take-off had created considerable
excitement—people were running back and
forth, like milling cattle when stampeded in a
furious thunder storm and Perk even fancied
there was some sort of a movement as though a
ship would be sent after them in pursuit.</p>

<p class='c013'>That troubled him not a bit, because already
they were leaving the field far in their wake, and
would really be lost in the gathering shadows of
coming night before any pursuit plane left the
ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides, had they not already had one experience
along those lines, and completely worsted
the persistent enemy, sending their boat down in
spirals of flames, with the two occupants forced
to “bail out” in order to save their lives?</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk put that possibility completely out of
his mind and busied himself with more practical
affairs. First of all he was desirous of communicating
with his comrade and to do this
they must have those indispensible head-phones
clapped to their ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was already applying his own pair with a
confidence inspired by frequent applications,
after which he managed to get Jack equipped
with the other pair.</p>

<p class='c013'>Steadily they continued to ascend, and swing
around until they faced the east, following the
plan Jack had outlined to his mate. Not too
high did the pilot urge his craft, since such a
course was apt to bring them in the sunlight
that still lingered along the upper air lanes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, they turned out to be a hot bunch all
right, partner,” was what Perk observed, when
he had the harness adjusted and the ear-phone
means of communication in shape for use.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You reckon they must have fetched the police
out with them, do you, Perk?” demanded the
one at the stick, as he kept an eye on his dials
spread across the black dashboard in front of the
cockpit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! just what they did, old hoss,” returned
the other, vehemently, but accompanying his remark
with a loud chuckle that told of secret
amusement, he being excessively fond of anything
that smacked of a joke; “an’ they kept up
a runnin’ fire at us, let me tell you—could see the
flashes spittin’ like fire crackers on the Fourth
o’ July.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All of which sounds like they must have told
a pretty wild and woolly yarn to the cops, to
make them want us as bad as that, eh, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Makes me think they got an idea this ain’t
goin’ to be just a ordinary man-hunt, but something
worth while; we should worry, Jack.
Mebbe they a’ready see the handwritin’ on the
wall, an’ mean to try an’ upset us in the start,
’fore we get agoin’ full tilt. Notice you’ve gone
an’ headed east, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It may fool them; but whether it does or not,
Perk, such a move’s our proper caper. When
we’ve gone something like ten or fifteen miles
we’ll get on the curve, swing around to the south,
and then when in sight of the gulf turn due west;
after that we’ll be on our way to the place where
our work is waiting for us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! had an idea you’d just climb till out
o’ sight, an’ then cross over the city and river—how
’bout it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too much risk to begin with,” came the ready
reply, showing how Jack always planned ahead;
“you know how a rushing boat can be heard
clearly even when lost to sight among the clouds.
It might be those same smart chaps, backed by
the authority of the police, would commandeer
a ship, and cruise around over the city, so as to
learn if we <i>did</i> come back so as to line out into
the heart of Texas; to make sure such a giveaway
of our plans can’t upset our calculations
we’ll cross the delta of the Mississippi close to
where it joins its muddy waters with the gulf.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you now, partner, an’ let me say I guess
that’s the safest game we c’n play. Time don’t
count anything wuth while with us on this trip
but results are what we crave.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it that time, boy, the Big Boss has
confidence in our being able to fetch home the
bacon, and we’re bound to prove he didn’t make
any mistake in putting us on the job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>All this time they continued to zoom along
like a frightened wild duck, and it was not long
before Jack was turning the nose of his ship
toward the south. The night had not as yet
settled down over the earth, although they were
holding an altitude of several thousand feet and
by straining his eyes a bit Perk was able to distinguish
objects far below—he could tell when
they passed over a large sheet of water, probably
Lake Ponchartrain, with narrower cuts winding
through vast marshes, and seas of waving reeds;
also begin to catch fugitive glimpses of the still
distant Mexican Gulf stretching away to the
mysterious south.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was all deeply interesting to Perk, always
on the lookout for fresh and novel scenes; for as
it happened, thus far in all his wanderings he
had really never looked upon that historical sheet
of salt water; although reading many a rattling
romance of the days when buccaneers and pirates
haunted the sub-tropical waters of that same
gulf, lying in wait for the Spanish galleons laden
with gold bars taken from the prodigally rich
mines of Mexico and Central America.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Perk’s mind those historical personages,
like Blackbeard, and his fellow rovers of the
Black Flag, lent a glamour to the great body of
water that was apt to thrill him through and
through whenever he allowed his gaze to fall
upon its restless surface, and dark secrets of the
past ages.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards their course was again
altered, with the ship swinging into the west. It
would seem to have been something like extreme
caution on Jack’s part but from all accounts, as
well as from their own experience with the desperate
gang that had given Uncle Sam so much
trouble, the scoundrels had a tremendous game
at stage, and were ready to go to any lengths to
protect the profitable conspiracy from being
smashed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Safety before speed” had always been Jack’s
slogan, which could be accounted one of the leading
reasons for the success that had come to him
in the various vocations he had followed—as a
county fair barn-stormer, then in the regular air
mail service, and now finally with the celebrated
Secret Service arm of the Government, entrusted
with one of the most abnormal duties ever given
out to its members.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not too dark for Perk to know when they
were passing over the several outlets to the
mighty river; indeed, he was even able to distinguish
an ocean going steamship heading up
toward the city of New Orleans; for its lights
were plainly in evidence and those who chanced
to be on deck could probably catch the throb of
their motor, since the air was unusually still,
allowing sounds to be heard at great distances,
especially when in the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then finally they left the water behind, and
found themselves passing over great stretches of
sugarcane, and bamboo thickets, with cabins of
the humble blacks in little hamlets, sometimes
villages of the lowlands, where, as Perk plainly
recollected, recent terrible floods had wrought
such damage.</p>

<p class='c013'>So the night wore on, and thus far nothing
had occurred to cause them the slightest worry.
If their cunning enemies suspected them of
planning to go west, and baiting the chief in his
lair, there was nothing as yet to show that they
were making arrangements to intercept the air
adventurers on their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>An hour—two of them passed, and still they
kept making rapid progress. The moon was long
above the eastern horizon, although occasionally
obscured by passing clouds but Perk told himself
it was a pretty fair night, all things considered,
and that he had “no kick coming.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c014'>CHAPTER XV <br /> <br />PERK AS A FIRE-FIGHTER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was not far from midnight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had insisted on taking over the controls,
so that Jack might secure a little rest, possibly
even pick up a few catnaps in addition. They
were at a low altitude, perhaps not more than a
thousand feet up, since the air was a bit cool
higher and it was certain they stood in no
danger from colliding with mountain peaks
while crossing the wide State of Texas, where
nothing save the level plains lay beneath.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was alive to his duties, but this did not
keep him from occasionally stretching his neck,
so as to look over the coaming of the cockpit,
and trying to make out objects that might be
dimly detected on the seemingly limitless plain
below.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a rule next to nothing worth while rewarded
these efforts and really he continued
doing his little stunt from sheer habit, but there
did come a time when he showed sudden interest,
and even half arose from his seat to stare
with increasing intensity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not only that but he immediately banked, to
start circling around a certain point. A minute
afterwards Perk reached out and shook Jack
gently by the shoulder. The ear-phones being
still affixed to their heads, Jack naturally desired
to know what was up, and did his pal wish to
give over the stick to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ doing, partner,” he was told with
emphasis; “but there’s somethin’ queer goin’ on
down yonder, and I’ve swung around so’s to give
it the once over. On your right, Jack, an’ there,
see how it sparks up again, will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say it looks like a fire,” ventured Jack,
after taking a good look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My idea to a fraction, boss!” snapped the
deeply interested Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like it might be breaking out through
the roof of some sort of cabin, or ranch house,”
further suggested Jack, himself now almost as
excited as his running mate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, boy!” declared Perk; “but somehow
I don’t lamp anybody kickin’ around in a
big fuss, ’cause o’ the shack bein’ ablaze; strikes
me either nobody ain’t to home or else they’re
so sound asleep they don’t know what’s goin’ on.
Glory be! if that’s the case, partner, they stand
a mighty good chance o’ bein’ burnt to death in
their beds. What ought we do ’bout it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“First place we’ve just got to rouse ’em up,
and the way to do that is to rush our engine to the
limit, so’s to make a big row—if that doesn’t
wake anybody it’ll only mean they’re away from
home—or else already smothered by the smoke.”
Perk accordingly started up such a racket that
the dreadful roaring noise seemed hoarse enough
to awaken the dead and all the while he kept
swinging around in a continuous circle.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, bending over the side, watched to see if
this had any effect, nor was his discovery long
delayed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That fetched them, Perk—I can see several
moving figures, and they seem to be rushing about
with pails in their hands. If the fire hasn’t got
too strong a start they may be able to throw
enough water to put it out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, couldn’t we do somethin’ more to help
the poor dicks?” cried Perk, ever ready and
willing to assist anybody in trouble, no matter
at what cost or personal risk to himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It mightn’t be a safe thing to attempt a blind
landing,” he was told; but something in Jack’s
voice or manner when he said this encouraged
Perk to go a bit further.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, chances are it’s as level as a barn floor
down there,” he hastened to say, eagerly; “here,
you could take the stick—there never was a better
hand at makin’ a three-point landin’ than
you, partner; me, I might drop a few flares down,
an’ that’d give us a squint o’ the ground. If we
kept to leeward o’ the fire there wouldn’t be any
risk from sparks, don’t you see, Jack? I never
yet had such a fat chance to be a fire-fighter;
let’s go, boy—they need all the help they c’n
get, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The temptation was so great it soon overpowered
Jack’s sense of caution; really he fancied
he would never forgive himself if he allowed
Perk to show a higher sense of duty to people
in distress than he himself could display.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, you win, Perk!” he quickly called
out; “hand over the stick, and get those flares
ready to drop when I give the word.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk started to make a move, showing that he
knew just where the objects of his desire were
located, for he did not have to leave his seat in
order to place his hand upon the small package
of flares.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile Jack had reduced their speed to
a minimum compatible with safety, still continuing
that circular movement. The fire had
by this time assumed sufficient proportions to
dispel any doubts they may have entertained regarding
its true nature, for it was burning at a
lively rate. Jack could see a crouching figure
sprawled on the roof, and apparently emptying
bucket after bucket of water on the greedy flames,
and passing the empties back down the nearby
ladder to some one standing on an upper rung.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was all mighty exciting, and to Jack seemed
like some sort of fetching picture as shown on
the silver screen at the movies—a scene developed
through the skill of a wizard director, aided
by a group of star actors, so as to bring out all
the realistic effects.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get ready, Perk!” he told the other suddenly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All set, partner,” came the inspiring response.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let her go, then!” called out the pilot, just
as he found himself over a point to leeward of the
burning ranch house that he figured would be
the best place to make a landing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had a flare falling almost as the last
words left the lips of the pilot and then both
of them used their eyes to advantage as it neared
the ground, lighting up a small section fairly
well—at least what he thus saw seemed to convince
Jack it would be fairly safe to attempt a
landing, for the ground looked smooth, and free
from outbuildings, corrals, or wire fences.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Drop another, quick as you can!” directed
Jack; then, as this was carried out he started
down, showing the die was cast, come what
would.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk threw a third flare to one side, in the
hope that its light would afford his pilot a chance
to effect one of his really marvelous landings;
which turned out to be sound reasoning on his
part—the shock when their landing gear came in
contact with the ground was not very severe, and
Jack managed so that they did not run more than
thirty feet toward the burning house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus far all was well.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was out of the cockpit like a flash, but
managed to hold his eager spirit in check long
enough to allow his comrade to join him. Then
they hurried over to the building, which they
could now see, thanks to both the moonlight and
the brilliance of the blaze, must be some kind of
a ranch house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Several men who had the appearance of cow
punchers were working for all they were worth,
fetching water from a well, and hurling it where
it was calculated to do the most good.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s give you a hand in that game, neighbors!”
Jack burst out with, as he joined the string,
backed by Perk, and commenced handling
buckets full and buckets empty, with as much
vim as though tested and tried members of a
village fire company.</p>

<p class='c013'>At such a time the addition of two more
willing workers can do considerable toward
smothering a fire, especially when there happens
to be no wind moving; and from the moment of
their arrival things began to take on a better
look as though up to then the fight had been
hovering “on the fence,” as Perk called it, and
the balance being overturned, victory was in
sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was in his glory, and the brisk way in
which he hurried those buckets along was worth
going a long way to witness; Jack never would
forget how proud he felt over the marvelous performance
of his running mate, and how those
encouraging cries, so constantly emitted by Perk,
seemed to enthuse everybody with fresh vim and
go.</p>

<p class='c013'>Finally the last spark was extinguished, and
the house saved, having suffered but scant damage.
Then the men, yes, and women too, gathered
around the pair of aviators who had come
on the scene just in the nick of time, to first of
all arouse the people of the prairie ranch to a
sense of the danger that hovered over their heads,
and finally take chances in effecting what might
have been a rough landing, so as to lend their
material aid to the fire fighters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Surely you will not think of starting off again
till break of day,” the big man with the white
head of hair, evidently the rancher himself, was
saying, while engaged in pumping the hands of
the two who had dropped down from the sky,
as it were, to bring warning of the burning roof,
and start the stiff fight against the greedy flames
that had ended so successfully. “Stay and eat
breakfast with us, strangers; we’d like to know
you both some better, and have a chance to thank
you most heartily.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unfortunately we must be on our way, neighbor,”
Jack told him. “It happens we are on
special duty, and delay might upset certain plans
we are bent on following out. It was just by
sheer accident we discovered the fire, and took
the customary means for attracting attention that
all air pilots employ; but some other day, if we
chance to be in this neighborhood, we’d be
pleased to see more of you all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The women added their voices to the pressing
invitation, but Jack was forced to decline, although
doing so smilingly, since he would have
liked very much to see more of these warm-hearted
stockmen and their wild riders, possibly
picking up some useful knowledge concerning
the way a ranch is run in these modern days, so
different from early times in the cattle country.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is absolutely necessary for us to be going,”
Jack told them all, “if we are lucky enough to
be able to hop-off again. Perk, I wish you’d
take a look over toward the west, and see if the
ground is fairly clear; while I talk for a few
more minutes with our new friends here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was astute enough to avoid giving their
names to any one but the ranchman, who readily
promised not to mention them to a living soul;
he felt heavily indebted to Jack and his chum,
and considered that they knew their business
best—for one thing he felt absolutely certain the
fact of their being in such a hurry had nothing
whatever to do with any unlawful act on their
part—he had as much confidence in them as
though Jack had actually confided the fact of
their being Government Secret Service agents,
bound on a mission fraught with much peril to
life and limb, the prime object of which was to
save honest people from being victimized by a
gang of unprincipled sharks, makers of clever
bank notes that were without the pale of the
law and only base counterfeits, although clever
imitations of the genuine bills.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVI <br /> <br />IN THE GRIP OF THE STORM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Perk soon afterwards showed up, and seemed
so cheerful that it was evident his little scouting
mission had yielded favorable results.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems okay to me, partner!” he burst out
with, as soon as she came along; “course it ain’t
just as smooth as some fields we know but there
ain’t goin’ to be any smart trouble takin’ off, I
guess now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And are we holding the nose of the ship
straight in line of the course you took a squint
at, Perk?” Jack asked, as he prepared to climb
into his seat, the people of the ranch clustering
around, to gaze with wide open eyes at the fleet
aircraft, some of them doubtless seeing such a
modern cloud clipper for the first time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dead ahead, boss, an’ you’ll strike the right
racket, I’m tellin’ you,” came the positive assurance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then jump aboard, comrade, and we’ll put
it to the test,” saying which Jack himself climbed
into the waiting cockpit, to settle down in his
accustomed seat, take a quick glance at his dials
when the small light was turned on, and await
a signal from the other sky traveler that he was
“fixed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The way was clear, and the fact that just then
the gay old moon condescended to poke her smiling
face out from behind a mass of clouds assisted
more or less in giving the pilot some of the
necessary illumination—the rest must be left to
his native sagacity and instinct.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a bunch of cottonwoods at some
little distance ahead, the location of which Perk
had pointed out to his mate before settling down
in his seat but if all went well Jack calculated
to be able to clear them in good shape—did it
seem necessary he could swerve slightly to the
right, and have a clear field for the take-off.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a little shouting as the friendly
plane started to taxi along, but of course this was
smothered by the increasing roar of exhaust and
spinning propeller. Faster and faster they scurried
onward, and then started to rise on an angle
just sufficient to nicely clear the tops of the cottonwoods;
when Jack jazzed his motor, to find
it running as “sweet as a purring cat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So they departed only a short time after making
that landing which humanity had demanded
and in times to come the little episode was
likely to afford both aviators more or less satisfaction,
in that they had “seen their duty and
done it,” as Perk would say in his whimsical
way.</p>

<p class='c013'>As they continued on their way Perk found
himself wondering if this interesting adventure
was destined to be a sample of other equally
thrilling happenings in store for them the further
they dipped into the great game that had been
laid at their door by the powers that be at Washington.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whenever he came to thinking of the audacity
shown by Slippery Slim in virtually defying all
the authority of the Government, Perk would
feel his dander rising as if in great indignation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh!” he at one time told himself, being
rather fond of thus communing, as his thoughts
ran on, “we’ll call <i>his</i> bluff just the same, the
scaly ol’ gila monster, you wait an’ see. Thinks
he’s the whole works, the boss man-handler, does
he, just ’cause he’s outguessed a number o’ the
boys. This time he’s due to find himself up
against guys o’ the right size, who’ll jerk him
down off’n his high perch in a jiffy, or I miss
my ticket.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk kept on boasting in his customary
fashion, possibly to keep his mind on the subject.
Jack was paying little attention to side issues
just then for he knew his pal’s peculiarities, and
short-comings as well and having “exhausted
his boiler” Perk presently lapsed into utter
silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had climbed to a fairly high ceiling, and
caught only occasional fugitive glimpses of the
earth far below, when the moon chanced to break
through the banks of clouds, which intervals
became less and less frequent, Jack noticed.</p>

<p class='c013'>He did not altogether fancy the looks of the
heavens, by degrees becoming more and more
overcast; still, this might after all mean next to
nothing and their business was to keep steadily
on their way as if things were bound to come out
all right.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was now drawing well on toward midnight,
and they had placed hundreds of miles between
the city of their recent stay and themselves. Long
since Perk had taken what proved to be his last
glimpse of the vast gulf as seen far away toward
the south, when the night was brightly illuminated,
with the moon’s silvery rays shining on the
glistening waters, and making a picture that
even appealed to Perk’s rugged nature—after
that all he was able to make out was the monotonous
level plains that lay in every quarter,
as though the whole earth consisted of this same
stock country.</p>

<p class='c013'>No longer were they able to find any cheer in
the company of the moon, for the canopy above,
earlier in the night peopled by a multitude of
bright stars, was now gripped in dense masses
of clouds.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having thus lost his guide marks below, Jack
was compelled to place all dependence upon his
faithful instruments, but this of course was an
old story to one of his experience, so that he did
not do any worrying on that score.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, buried in his own thoughts, and paying
scant heed to what changes were taking place
in the signs of the weather, had no warning until
suddenly there came a dazzling flash, that was
almost instantly succeeded by a tremendous burst
of thunder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ginger pop! that means we’re booked for a
bit o’ storm, mebbe, eh, Jack?” was his startled
exclamation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s hope it turns out to be <i>only</i> a bluster,”
the pilot went on to say, as he turned the nose of
his ship upward, and commenced to climb, evidently
in hopes that by so doing they might get
above those low hanging clouds, and have clear
sailing while the disturbance lasted.</p>

<p class='c013'>When shortly afterwards a second electrical
crash almost stunned them by its violence, Perk
began to fumble for his oilskin coat, which he
was never without when aboard a boat with an
open cockpit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk could take a ducking with as much good
nature as the next fellow but just the same he
did not intend to get soaked if he could help it,
since a continuance of the flight, with a cold wind
likely to follow the rain, would not prove to be
the most delightful experience possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>No sooner had he accomplished the job of
securing his raincoat than he gave Jack the well
known signal that he meant to take over the
stick, and thus allow his comrade to also protect
himself against bad weather.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly both of them were presently thus
equipped, and ready to take whatever might be
in the offing. Meanwhile the ascent was continued
in spasms, for there was always a chance
of getting above such a storm, and avoiding the
worst of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The thunder claps became more frequent, and
also much louder, so that each sudden burst gave
them both a thrill, death seemed so close, for
should their speeding ship chance to attract one
of those dazzling bolts it would be all over for
the daring air adventurers, and no one be the
wiser concerning their taking-off, until possibly
after long months had passed, their bleached
bones might be discovered by some party of
plainsmen out looking for rustlers or seeking to
round up missing stock.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus far not a single drop of rain had fallen,
according to Perk’s calculations but the coming
of the drenching flood could not be much longer
delayed, he felt positive. Had there not been
so much racket around them those keen ears of
his might have detected a rushing sound in the
near distance, like the roar of the incoming tide
on the sandy shores of the gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then it came with a swoop, the wind whistling
around their ears and the rain beating a tattoo
against the fuselage of the ship, as well as striking
them smartly in the face, despite such protection
as their helmets and heavy goggles afforded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack certainly had his hands full in managing
the bobbing, shifting craft, gripped by those
shifty gusts that came with giant force, making
the flyers feel as though they were clinging to a
mere chip tossed about in the wild fury of a
Texas tempest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Time and again did Perk feel as though his
heart had jumped up in his throat, almost choking
him; seasoned veteran at this sort of thing
as he believed himself to be, he could not help
this feeling of helplessness in the hands of the
aroused elements; yet each time Jack managed
to bring their ship through the teeth of the storm
in a way that was next door to miraculous, and
if Perk had up to this time not fully appreciated
the astonishing skill and confidence of his younger
companion while at the controls in an emergency,
he certainly was getting his lesson then and
there, in a way to cause it to sink deep, and stick.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch17' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVII <br /> <br />A FIGHT WELL WON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was no longer possible for the busy pilot to
keep on his course. Every minute of his time
was taken up with a desperate effort to keep
from being thrown into a nose dive, that, unless
miraculously conquered, would be likely to
send them whirling down, to crash from a five
thousand foot ceiling, and thus bring about a
complete writeoff.</p>

<p class='c013'>That however was the least of Jack’s worries—all
he asked was the ability and luck to be
able to fend off threatening disaster; could this
be done successfully in good time they could
pick up all that was lost, and once more continue
their westward flight.</p>

<p class='c013'>The battering they endured was simply tremendous,
and Jack marveled at the ship being
able to withstand such a horrible strain. If
but a single strut gave way under all that pounding
it would mean starting a series of similar
mishaps such as would quickly render them incapable
of keeping aloft; and with this threat
hanging over their heads it can readily be understood
neither of the two could be in a comfortable
frame of mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still it is wonderful how men thus threatened
will continue to carry on, although in an almost
mechanical fashion, doing just the necessary
thing with each change of pace on the part of
the tricky storm, and meeting successfully every
near tragedy as it arises to clutch them in its
grip.</p>

<p class='c013'>No longer did Jack keep on climbing—it
seemed to him that the further the staggering
boat lifted the more dangerous became their
situation for the air was surcharged with electricity
as the zigzag lightning darted from cloud
to cloud, doubling the chances of their frail
craft being struck.</p>

<p class='c013'>In fact it seemed so terrible above that he
lacked the nerve to persist in the upward work,
and even commenced to drop down. Perk
noticing this move, hardly knew what to make
of it. He was, as he himself would have expressed
it, “hanging on by his teeth,” in order
to keep his seat in the wildly plunging airship
and on finding that the bold pilot had given up
hope of finding relief in the upper regions, the
fact appalled him. Could it be Jack had decided
to attempt a landing, with only the glare
of those repeated electrical flashes to serve as
airport lights? That indeed would be next to
admitting their case as hopeless, and that Jack
was taking such desperate chances only as a last
resort.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were zooming along all this time as if
pursued by a jinx and indeed with such weird
accompaniments it would not be hard to believe
the spirit of the storm took on the part of such a
goblin of the air, to pursue relentlessly this bold
invader of the home of the aroused elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk hit the bullseye close to the center when
afterwards, in describing their experience on
this night of the great blow, he vowed they were
“playing dice with death,” since it seemed a bare
chance that they could ever pull through alive.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such is the life of the aviator—one hour sailing
smoothly along, at peace with all mankind,
envying no man his following, and feeling himself
to be on the top of the world—the next and
he may be fighting with might and main the
mad demons of the air, his life hanging in the
balance, his strength ebbing fast, and unless the
little cherub aloft that is said to be watching
over each sailor, whether of the sea or the limitless
air, comes to the rescue, his fate is sealed,
and another modern Argonaut never comes back
again to the home port.</p>

<p class='c013'>It did not seem to be any the less exciting even
when they had succeeded in gaining a much
lower altitude; although possibly the danger
from those thunderbolts might have been somewhat
abated. Perk soon realized that his pilot
had no intention of trying for a landing in the
midst of such a turmoil and confusion, which
fact relieved his harried feelings to some extent.
Indeed, it would have been a mad proceeding,
and almost unheard of, since hardly the slightest
chance offered for the most skillful pilot to
reach the earth without disaster, such as making
a ground loop, and having the heavy engine bury
them under its weight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk endeavored to convince himself that
things were a bit easier since a lower altitude
had been effected but in so doing he feared he
was only deceiving himself—if anything at all
things were even worse,—although the drop
might not be so far, which was small comfort,
since it must mean their complete annihilation
if it befell them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had numerous spasms when he fancied
something was going amiss with their staunch
craft, although unable to decide the exact nature
of the imaginary trouble. Despite all these
chills, which must have been the products of his
excitement, they managed to hold out minute
after minute, which fact gave more or less cause
for renewed hope.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack must indeed be almost completely exhausted,
and yet he refused to give up the controls,
to which his hands seemed glued as though
riveted there. Perk punched his side numbers
of times, but could get no favorable response,
proving that the other deemed it too hazardous
a proceeding to change possession of the stick
while in the whirl of that shrieking gale—which
was indeed only another adaptation of the old
proverb “it is folly to change horses when crossing
a stream.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no means for communication with
each other, even though they may have wished
to do so, since the ear-phones had been discarded
with the donning of their slickers, and
could not be put back in position, owing to the
sudden bursting of the storm, and the necessity
for employing their hands in more useful pursuits.</p>

<p class='c013'>All Perk could do was to hang on, keeping
himself ready to seize hold should his companion
be suddenly compelled to release his grip
through sheer weariness—that, and keeping tabs
of the weather, so as to glean the first favorable
sign that came along, promising a let-up, or at
least a break.</p>

<p class='c013'>Judging from the heavy rain that had come
down in such a solid stream it must be reckoned
one of those dreadful cloud-bursts of which he,
Perk, had so often heard, but which thus far in
his experience he had never met up with. No
doubt rivers would be out of their beds long before
dawn although that angle of the situation
did not interest them in the least, since their
traveling would not be interfered with a particle,
if only the air proved inviting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yes, soon Perk believed he could detect a lessening
of the baffling crosswinds that had been
so trying to the pilot, keeping him continually
on the anxious seat—then, too, it struck him the
floods were growing weaker in the bargain;
which two facts gave poor Perk a feeling akin to
joy in the region of his heart, such as he may
have known on previous occasions, but that must
have been far down in his adventurous past.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to their altimeter they were something
like two thousand feet from the ground,
but of course never the faintest glimpse could
they secure of what lay beneath them, so poor
was the visibility, with all that torrent of water
pouring down as might a mountain cataract.</p>

<p class='c013'>This delightful feeling grew stronger as minutes
passed—at this rate he would soon be able
to influence tired Jack to renounce his frozen
hold on the stick, and turn the handling of the
ship over to his chum.</p>

<p class='c013'>In this frame of mind he again nudged the
other, but in turn received a negative shake of
the head, which meant there was “nothing doing”—in
other words, since the storm still raged,
even though in somewhat diminished violence,
they must not be too premature, and spoil it all
just when the victory seemed about to drop into
their hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>With what Perk hoped would prove to be a
last dying spurt the rain came pelting down,
after which it suddenly stopped as though an
unseen hand away up among the clouds, had
plugged the gap, and kept any more water from
running out—enough was enough, surely, Perk
was telling himself when he made this thrilling
discovery and for one he felt he had had sufficient
rain to last him the balance of that year.</p>

<p class='c013'>So too did the wind start to diminish its force,
also coming from one direction with more constancy—some
relief to Jack, that was certain,
since now he could know just how to steer his
turbulent craft so as to meet the force driving
against it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then what did Perk do but start getting his
ear-phones adjusted, being wild to hear a human
voice, after all that fiendish roaring and howling
kicked up by the raging elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>Why, already the atmosphere had cleared
enough for him to catch faint glimpses of what
lay beneath them—it looked as though they had
come to a stretch of country where the level
prairie had changed into rougher ground, with
deep swales, sometimes running into quite respectable
ravines and there were indications of
ridges ahead, which might even prove to be
fairly high, so that it would have been tempting
Providence had Jack dropped still lower, while
flying blind through all that welter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Talk to me ’bout luck,” the grateful Perk
was saying to himself, “I never ran ’cross anything
like <i>this</i>—they told me Jack must a been
born under a lucky star, an’ now I sure b’lieves
it to be the right stuff they were givin’ me, an’
no taffy either. But that was some fight, take
it from me, fellers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards Jack condescended to give
him the sign that he was willing to pass up the
job; whereat Perk quickly superseded him as
pilot, and saw the other sink back in his cramped
quarters as though unable to hold up his tired
arms a second longer. Apparently the relief
had come not a minute too soon, for he must have
been close to the point of utter exhaustion after
so long and violent a strain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Battered as the crate had been while the gale
lashed them so madly, it had stood up under the
buffeting most amazingly and Perk would
never have occasion to utter anything saving
words of praise for the model and its makers;
it must be as near perfection as aircraft are being
built these days of man’s victory over the
savage forces of the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Setting his course in what he believed to be the
proper direction Perk waited until Jack seemed
fairly well recovered, when he was pleased to
see the other take up his head harness as though
he too felt the necessity for opening up communications
with his running mate, which outlook
gratified Perk immensely.</p>

<p class='c013'>There were many things he wished to have
made clear, and besides, he felt more than curious
to learn what Jack’s next move might turn
out to be—that they had drifted far from their
original course went without saying but a means
must be found to recover the lost ground, after
which they could take up the game again just
where the sudden storm had caused such a diversion.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then the moon peeped out through a
break in the clouds overhead, as though to tell
them it was all over, with decent weather once
more in the offing.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch18' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVIII <br /> <br />THE DESERTED SHACK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Well, that’s somehow I guess over, and I’m
mighty glad,” was the way Perk voiced his feelings,
when the clouds were rolling away, and the
heavenly host of stars backed up the moon in
lighting up the firmament.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Same here,” echoed Jack, still more or less
tired after his energetic battle with the unleashed
elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And strikes me the air’s got some chilly,”
added the other; “I own up I’m shivering to
beat the band right now. Where d’ye figger we
might be, partner—must a lost our course in all
that kettle o’ rain an’ wind, an’ drifted far to
the south, eh, what, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question about it, Perk; I could feel the
pull right along; still, there wasn’t a thing to do
but let the old crate take the reins in her teeth.
Once morning comes we’ll manage somehow to
get a line on our locality, and swing back to our
course.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some hours off yet,” ventured Perk, whose
lips were indeed trembling, as if the chill was
beginning to get in its work—perhaps all that
recent excitement was helping to make him
shiver, as it often will, even in the case of the
most valiant of men.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack noticed this fact, even though he himself
experienced nothing similar, for some reason or
other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Perk, you ought to have a chance
to sit alongside a warm fire and dry off; the rain
must have got under your slicker, and I reckon
now you’re slopping around in water back there.
Something’s <i>got</i> to be done about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! boss, don’t bother ’bout me; I’m a
hard-shell you must know, an’ a little dampness
ain’t agoin’ to do me any harm, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just the same we’ll try and make a landing,”
continued the other, “if there’s half a chance;
all I’d want would be to stack up against a level
stretch of upland, where the drainage had carried
off all that flood.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, that sounds all to the good, boy but
what difference will it make, I want to know?
After such a storm it’s bound to be some cold
even away down here along the Texas-Arizona
line; they call them Northers, jest like I’ve heard
they do down in Florida. Forget it, partner—I’m
a tough guy, an’ ain’t wantin’ to be coddled
like a baby.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just the same I say we’re going to land, if
half a chance shows up,” affirmed the pilot, in
that set way of his. “We’ll find the stuff to build
some sort of fire, Perk, where you could make
a pot of hot coffee; which’d do you more good
than a switch of hard liquor. Put that in your
pipe and smoke it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk remained silent for almost two whole
minutes, during which time no doubt he was
revolving in his mind what Jack had proposed—in
imagination he could almost <i>smell</i> the delicious
aroma of the coffee, boiling so merrily
over the red coals and even feel a joyous sensation
of warmth stealing through his chilled body.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Okay, Jack; you win, hands down. Me for
the coffee every time, to be followed by a quiet
smoke o’ my fav’rite brand o’ tobac. Have your
own way about it, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then get ready to try and make out what
sort of ground we’ll soon be passing over,” added
Jack, as he turned the ship earthward, and slid
down on a long glide, with the motor clamped
shut. “We’ll skim along close enough for you
to get a good idea as to how matters stand, and
yet giving enough distance to keep clear of any
clump of trees, or little bald knobs of rises.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently Perk assured him he could manage
to get fair glimpses at what lay below; at which
Jack again started on an even keel, moving with
as little speed as was compatible with safety.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not very long before the watcher gave
tongue.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Looks good to me down yonder, partner—guess
now we might make a safe an’ sane landin’—’specially
with <i>you</i> at the stick. Circulate
a little bit to the south, brother, ’cause it looks
some better thataways.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This Jack did, and then at another signal from
the observer, he proceeded to drop down with
almost as much confidence as he might have felt
when making a landing on Candler Field, well
lighted, and with every convenience suited to
safety and comfort.</p>

<p class='c013'>His confidence, it seemed, had not been misplaced,
for they effected a very fair contact, all
things considered, even though the landing was
somewhat “joggly and rough” as Perk expressed
it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once the ship came to a stop and both of them
hastened to clamber out of their close quarters—“cribbed,
cabined and confined,” Jack sometimes
liked to say in connection with their limited
cockpit, although his pal always reminded him
of the fact that <i>cabin</i> was something only conspicuous
by its absence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk’s first movement was to start threshing
his arms against his thighs with more or less
vigor, in which he showed good common sense
since there is no better method for stirring up
sluggish circulation after a long period of inaction.
Jack on his part commenced to check
up on certain sections of the undergear, meaning
to make certain he had done no damage in making
connection with the earth under such unfavorable
conditions.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything in ship-shape, I reckon, Perk,”
he announced. “And now let’s make out to find
something in the line of trees, where we might
pick up enough wood for that fire.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Looks kinder like things’d be mighty well
soaked after all that downpour,” affirmed the
shrewd Yankee-Canadian; “so it’d be a tough
job coaxin’ stuff to take fire. But wait a minute,
partner—I didn’t get a chance to tell you that I
spied what looked like an ol’ tumbledown shack
over to windward—I guess now it might be
abandoned, but just the same, partner, we’d be
apt to run across some dry wood inside.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suppose you step over and take a look-in,
Perk,” suggested the other. “I’ll stand by the
crate here, and keep our little glim working, so
you’ll get your bearings when you start back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, Jack,” acceded the lanky one,
always eager for any sort of service; “an’ by the
same token now I’ll tote my gun along—never
c’n tell what sorter game you’ll stack up against
on these here Texas plains, I’m told. I feel like
I could knock over a wolf er two, just to get my
blood to movin’ at a faster clip—how ’bout it,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suit yourself, Perk,” he was told, as Jack
climbed back into the cockpit so as to manipulate
the light he mentioned, and which would prove
sufficient to serve the wanderer as a beacon when
wishing to retrace his steps.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly Perk wandered off, having decided
as to the quarter where he had glimpsed
what looked like an old and lonely shack or
cabin, faintly seen in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>He came back in a short time, bubbling over
with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all right, Jack—just like I guessed, it
turned out to be an ownerless shack but the roof
looks like it might’ve shed the rain, an’ oh! boy!
heaps o’ dry wood inside, with a whoppin’ big
fireplace where you could slap on the biggest
log agoin’. Mebbe I ain’t glad you thought o’
this game. Come along, an’ we’ll fetch the stuff
for a warm snack—coffee, crackers, an’ bacon
in the bargain. Talk to me about luck, it’s comin’
to us in big chunks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! we’ve got to get used to that sort of
thing,” said Jack, in the most matter-of-fact tone
imaginable; “when you’re on such a wonderful
lay as this anything’s likely to happen, and all
kinds of surprises spring out at you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder,” was all Perk could say in reply;
but he lost no time in gathering together such
articles as aluminum coffeepot, skillet, cups, and
such other things as he knew would be needed to
complete their little midnight spread.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon it’s safe for us to leave our crate
off here,” remarked the cautious Jack, “but I’ll
fix things so no busybody can take-off while we’re
away,” which he did without any trouble; after
which they both set out to move along to the
deserted shack Perk had located, lying right
there, just as if a favoring Fate had designed it
for their especial benefit in an emergency, as
the grateful Perk told himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Arriving at the humble shack, that once may
have housed a happy family in days that were
gone, they made use of Jack’s electric torch in
order to gather some dry splinters of wood,
which, heaped above some paper on the open
hearth, soon blazed up, and afforded them an
opportunity to take a look around.</p>

<p class='c013'>Other fuel more lasting was hurriedly added
to the fire, and this done the two air adventurers
took stock of their surroundings. There was
nothing much to see, since the shack happened
to be entirely devoid of any kind of furniture,
even of the most primitive make; but the roof
had stood the ravages of time, and promised to
hold out for years still to come.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk held out his chilled hands to the blaze
but only for a few minutes; apparently the possibility
of brewing some “nectar” was an overpowering
temptation, for presently he started to
work.</p>

<p class='c013'>In short order he had the steam coming out
of the coffee pot spout, and a most delightful
odor permeated the interior of that ancient
shack. When the coffee was ready, Perk poured
some of the amber fluid in both aluminum cups,
and offered Jack one, together with a freshly
opened carton of tempting crackers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goes right to the spot,” the self-made <i>chef</i>
observed, rubbing a hand across his stomach, as
though experiencing the most blissful sensation
there; “best coffee I ever tasted, barrin’ none,
an’ say, I’ve tried it a good many places like
France and Germany, as well as in Turkey too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Same here,” Jack assured him, as he drained
his first cup. “By the way, didn’t you say you’d
fetched some bacon along over here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jest what I did, partner, an’ now I’ve had
my fust swaller o’ coffee I’ll get a move on an’
soon have some o’ the same asizzlin’ in the pan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He started to carry out his words, with the
interested Jack watching his efforts to try and
make the frying pan set evenly on the fire, a feat
that requires considerable knowledge of camp
tactics in order to be successful. After one near
spill, with Perk only saving an upset by quick
work, Jack modestly broke in to give a bit of
advice, not forgetting, however, that old saying
about “too many cooks spoil the broth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too hot to keep hold of the handle looks like,
partner; now if only we were outdoors we might
find stones enough to form some sort of foundation
on three sides of the fire, where you could
rest your pan. Hold on, here’s this old hearth
that was made of some kind of Mexican bricks—adobe
they call them and it looks to me like
some of ’em might be loose. Here, I’ll manage to
pry a few up for you, Perk, old man—just hold—your—horses
and——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did not finish his sentence, and the cook,
glancing up to see what ailed him, found his
pal holding the first adobe in an uplifted hand,
while he was himself staring hard into the cavity
from which it had come, as if he saw something
wonderfully fascinating there!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch19' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIX <br /> <br />FORTUNE KNOCKS AT THE DOOR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“I swan! what’s the matter, partner—my
sakes; is it a <i>rattler</i> you uncovered, I wanter
know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk on his part was already sharing the excitement
of his pal, although apparently from
an entirely different reason. He had already
started to scramble to his knees, being doubtless
bent on taking some aggressive action, when he
saw Jack reach forward and deliberately pluck
some object from the hole under the displaced
adobe fire brick, and hold it up to view.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he saw its nature Perk’s jaw dropped, and
he was the picture of abject astonishment—but
it was far from being any poisonous reptile that
Jack was thus exhibiting with such a grand
flourish; just as though he might be some necromancer
or magician, and drawing all manner of
amazing things out of an apparently empty
stove-pipe hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gosh-a-mighty! that looks like real money!
I swan!” burst from Perk’s lips, as he continued
to stare.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just what it’s supposed to be, Pal Perk,”
said Jack, trying to keep his own voice from
displaying a genuine tremolo—“a neat wad of
it, waiting here for us to drop in and pick it up.
Seems like things might be set up, like tenpins
in the alley, for two lucky dogs to knock down
with a couple of rolled balls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If that don’t beat anything I ever did see,”
continued the astounded Perk, now grinning, as
though the pleasant nature of their find was
commencing to appeal to him. “Jest think o’ a
pair o’ air tramps ahappenin’ along, runnin’
across this here deserted shack, an’ findin’ a fortune
askin’ to be taken care of—don’t it beat the
Dutch what c’n happen—Arabian Night’s adventures
can’t hold a candle to the real thing in
these modern days. Some ol’ miser musta hid
that boodle under the bricks, so’s to keep the
Mex raiders comin’ up over the international
border from gettin’ their itchin’ fingers on it—how
’bout that, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Off color, I’m afraid, Perk,” Jack told him,
after taking a quick look at his wonderful find
in the hearth <i>cache</i>; “that miser story might go
with some but it doesn’t wash with me worth
a red cent. In the first place if this money had
been hidden here by a miser, he’d have taken it
away with him when he cut stick. Then again
it would surely have been partly in hard cash,
like gold eagles, and such stuff—all hoards of
misers, you remember, are made up like that,
Perk, and when you give this the once-over
you’ll also notice how it’s all in bills, mostly
fresh ones at that, as if they hadn’t seen much
circulation, as you might say.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk drew in a long breath, and continued to
stare hard at the object Jack was holding out in
front of him; it might be that something in the
other’s words and manner suggested certain possibilities
that seemed almost too staggering for
poor Perk to digest offhand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gee whittiker jewsharps! Jack—what’s this
you’re hintin’ at, ol’ pal—give it to me easy-like,
so I c’n swaller it—all in bills—mostly
fresh ones at that—not seen much handlin’
around—say, are you tryin’ to tell me they’re
every one five dollar bills,—Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon that’s what they are, Perk, I’d say,
from taking a quick look at the same.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bad currency—counterfeits—bogus stuff, er—what?”
gasped the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look for yourself, and you’ll recognize them
as having been printed from the same plates as
the one we’re carrying with us as a sample of
Slippery Slim’s best work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Je-ru-salem crickets! I’m knocked silly for
a fact,” whimpered Perk; and then, as if mustering
up his vanishing stamina he went on to add:
“but however could they’ve got right there under
that brick—conjurer’s black magic, looks
like to me, partner, it sure does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nonsense! that part of it is easy enough to
figure out,” asserted Jack, as usual very matter-of-fact;
“the only thing that seems to border on
the miraculous is our running across this packet
of all the people in the Far West—it looks to
me as if some sort of Destiny might be handling
the cards—that all we have to do is to keep moving
and everything’s bound to come our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure does seem like a snap, and that’s a fact,”
agreed Perk, calming down a little as he began
to grow more accustomed to the great discovery
that had resulted from their deciding to drop
down, and have a sociable cup of hot coffee;
“but I’ll be danged if I c’n make head or tail
out o’ this happening—now, what under the sun
did anybody want to stick that wad o’ long green
under the same adobes, I’d like to know, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! there might be any number of answers
to that question, Perk; for instance didn’t we
learn that it was the habit of Slim, or one of his
busy bees, to jump across the border every little
while with a load of the flimsy, and dole the stuff
out to a number of agents he has working with
him in this section of the country, also all the
way over to Los Angeles and San Diego?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was the spiel they gave us, for a fact,
boss,” admitted Perk, wagging his head eagerly,
as though he felt certain clever Jack would be
able to figure things out, and hit on some sort of
explanation that would cover these mysterious
happenings.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, this, then, might be one of his hidden
<i>caches</i>—at certain times this unknown agent
hides some <i>real</i> money in such a hole as this, and
comes along another dark night it might be to
pick up the big wad that was left in exchange
for the small one he contributed. And that is
the way the game runs, so I was told.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“By gum! but what grand luck for us to come
in on this deal, Jack—pretty soft, I’d call it,
and neither of us had any hand in it either—just
hit on this little bank by sheer chance! Goin’
to crib the loot, are you, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack scratched his head as though certain
plans were flitting through it, and he must make
a choice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, we have to start somewhere, you understand,
Perk, and it looks like the finger of
Fate might be pointing right at this shack, and
telling us to get busy and pick up a strong clue
that, if followed up, would take us straight to
that hideout Slim’s got across in Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess I see what you mean now, brother,”
ventured Perk, his face lighting up with extreme
joy; for he felt they were already on the track,
and that from that hour there must be rapid
action continuously. “If so be that ’ere critter
that slams out these bills on greenhorns and
come-ons is gettin’ anxious to see what sorter
prize he’s drawn in the lottery, why, he might
jest come along any ol’ time now, since the
storm’s over an’ there’s nawthin’ to hold him up.
Got any idea he’s nigh due here, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shouldn’t be a bit surprised if he walked in
on us any time,” ventured Jack; and then, seeing
the puzzled look on his chum’s rugged face
he went on to add: “I didn’t mention the fact
but while we were making our way over from
the ship I felt certain I glimpsed several far-off
lights, as if they might be in windows of cabins
or houses of some sort. Then, too, I surely did
hear a big dog barking, and something like a
rooster crowing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I’ll be jiggered if you ain’t got sharper
ears than I c’n boast, Jack, ol’ hoss, which ain’t
no lie either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t you believe it, Perk; it just happened
that you were so wrapped up in thinking of that
coffee treat you didn’t pay as much attention to
outside things as I did. So it seems as if there
might be some kind of a village or prairie town
not more than two miles from this abandoned
old shack and if that’s so then the chances are
this agent who’s been working the public for
Slim probably lives there. Then again, like as
not he has a pretty good idea about when his
bunch of kale ought to be placed under that
brick—in fact he might have made his way out
here this very night only for the storm threatening.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, partner,” Perk hastened to say, brimful
of energy, “which, bein’ the case, it’s up to
us to lay a sweet little mantrap, so’s to trip him
by the heels if so be he knocks on our door.
How’ll we fetch it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“First of all we’ll finish our supper, and clean
up here,” came the ready explanation; “he may
smell the odor of coffee and bacon, but then you
might expect this shelter to be used once in a
while by Mexican tramps, or passing cowboys,
especially when a big storm threatens, so that
isn’t going to scare the Johnny. As for us, we’ll
fix things so as to give him a nice little surprise,
by hiding out, after making things all dark inside
here, with water thrown on the fire to
smother the hot coals, after which there’s nothing
to do but take things easy until he shows up—if
he does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sabbe, okay, partner; let’s get busy, for
the bacon’s done brown to a turn.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch20' class='c014'>CHAPTER XX <br /> <br />SPRINGING THE TRAP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There was much that must be done before they
could feel satisfied they had their mantrap arranged.
Jack realized that if the party who
played the part of local agent for the counterfeiter
gang had been kept from coming to secure
the fresh supply of bogus bills by the threatening
storm, he was likely to make his appearance
at almost any time, since all danger from the
electrical disturbance was now past.</p>

<p class='c013'>They finished their little supper without
wasting any more time, after which the matter
of hiding all traces of their presence was taken
up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See if you can find any water outdoors,
Perk,” Jack was saying, as he contemplated the
red embers of their late fire. “Seems to me I
stepped in some sort of a puddle while coming
up to the door. Here’s an old rusty can that
looks as if it’d hold a quantity—I want to dash
it on these coals so as to cool them off. That
done we’ll find some way to hide, and watch developments.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk sized up the situation cleverly enough,
and lost no time in setting about doing as his pal
suggested. When he came back he was carrying
the rusty can, which did leak a trifle, but
then that made no particular difference, so long
as enough water remained to put the fire out.</p>

<p class='c013'>It sizzled, and steamed a bit but Perk distributed
the fluid contents of his can with such
discretion that all this was speedily brought to
a finish, with the last red ember cooled off, leaving
a dead little pile of wood ashes as the only
reminder of their blaze.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now that’s settled, partner,” said the always
ready Perk, “what comes next on our program?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had his hand electric torch in use, for
otherwise they must have been left to grope
around, since the clouds continued to drift past
in clusters, shutting out most of the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We must gather up everything here that
might give us away, for like as not the fellow’ll
fetch some kind of a light along with him—lantern
it may turn out to be, because he knows its
apt to be pretty dark inside the old shack, and
he can’t do much just by fumbling around.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! that’s right, boss,” returned Perk,
commencing to gather up any and all their
scanty belongings, not forgetting that convenient
rifle of his. “But I say, how ’bout the bus—won’t
he lamp the thing settin’ there in the open
an’ ain’t it apt to give him a bad start?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had duly considered that very point in
making up his plans, and was ready to meet the
situation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Taken it all in all, buddy, there’s small danger
of that happening,” he went on to tell Perk.
“First, remember, the ship lies on that side of
the shack away from the spot where I glimpsed
those lights and if he comes along in a direct
line from the town there isn’t one chance in three
of him noticing it. Even if he does I reckon
he’ll feel dead certain only his own messenger’d
be flying in this region—he may never have seen
another crate besides the one sent out by Slippery
Slim.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She sounds good to me, Jack an’ I’m willin’
to take a shy at the target, if so be you guess it’s
straight goods, all wool’n a yard wide. Let’s
go!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly both passed out of the deserted
shack that had proved such a fortunate harbor
for them after the late storm. Jack knew what
they must do in following up the little plan he
had framed, with a view of giving the suspect
the shock of his life and without any further
preliminaries he set about carrying out the few
details.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a chink or two in this further wall,”
he went on to say, in a low voice, next door to a
whisper, “that will furnish us means for keeping
tabs on what’s going on inside. We’ll settle down
there, and just wait. As luck has it that side of
the shack is away from the moon, which is all in
our favor, in fact everything seems to be arranged
just to suit our plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bully set-up, boss, couldn’t be better for a
fact,” agreed the hopeful Perk, who firmly believed
in the element of Luck, and was immensely
gratified to discover how that little god
was working over-time in their favor—according
to his way of thinking it was always “better
to be born lucky than rich.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it?” whispered Jack, after they
had commenced to crouch down in the darkened
spot he had selected.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just great, that’s all,” Perk assured him,
“show me where one o’ them cracks c’n be located,
partner, an’ then I’ll be okay—all
fixed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack obliged by directing his chum’s hand to
an opening, through which it would be easy
enough to keep watch over any happening inside
the shack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Next we’ll creep over to this further corner,
and try to find out when he comes along,”
continued Jack. “From now on, Perk, keep
your tongue between your teeth—no talking, remember,
but if it does seem to be absolutely
necessary, put your lips close to my ear, and
whisper—get that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nuff sed, boss, I’m on,” came faintly from
the figure crouching at Jack’s side, after which
abject silence fell upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>A little later on Perk, now that his hearing
was strained so as to pick up any kind of sound,
however slight, caught the barking of a watchdog;
it seemed to be at a considerable distance
from the shack, and he judged there might be a
couple of miles lying between. This was not a
great amount of ground to cover, if only the inducement
were sufficiently urgent and that fat
packet of enticing bank bills, supposed to be
secreted under the adobes of the old hearth, must
represent an alluring prize, capable of drawing
a chap who was fond of “easy money” out of his
snug home at this unseasonable hour of the
night, and indulging in a little hike, for which
effort he would fancy himself well repaid.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some time passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>They lay there just back of the comer of the
dilapidated and abandoned shack, waiting, listening,
and frequently feeling a little thrill when
some soft sound came stealing to their ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Perk plainly heard what was surely a
low cough, such as might be caused by a sudden
tickling in the throat. Some one was undoubtedly
approaching the spot, and coming from the
west, where they understood the prairie hamlet,
or village, lay at the foot of a small ridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>He merely touched his companion’s right arm
to let Jack know something was in the wind.
The cough was repeated, so that Perk chuckled
softly to himself, as if more than ever convinced
that luck was bent on handing them out further
fat plums.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was already creeping back so as to reach
the spot where those convenient peepholes could
be found and of course Perk imitated his example.
Thus it came about they were in complete
readiness to make good use of their eyes
when a slight scratching sound came from
within, and a tiny flash announced that the newcomer
had struck a match.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk could see him there down on his knees,
and intent on applying his lighted match to the
wick of a lantern he had evidently fetched along
for this very purpose. If Perk could have analyzed
the feeling that possessed him just then he
must have compared it to the exultation of a cat
when about to make a jump upon a sparrow,
close up to which he had managed to hide, all
prepared for the finishing act of the ambush.</p>

<p class='c013'>No sooner had the man succeeded in lighting
his lantern than with eager hands he commenced
lifting the adobe under which Jack had again
artfully placed the bait in the shape of that
tempting packet of bogus notes.</p>

<p class='c013'>How eagerly he pounced on the contents of
his queer <i>cache</i>, all the avariciousness of a miser
handling his hoard was displayed and at the
same time he looked hurriedly from one side to
the other, as though his guilty soul, conscious of
having thus broken the law of his country, was
already seeing the long arm of Justice stretching
out menacingly toward him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack evidently had seen enough to satisfy him
the genuine criminal was in focus, and that there
could be no miscarriage of Justice in effecting
his capture with the goods upon him. He was
creeping toward the open door of the shack, evidently
bent on taking the slick partner of the
counterfeiter chief by surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk lost no time in crawling at his pal’s heels,
bent on having a hand in the closing scene of the
little drama—he wanted to see with his own
eyes just how such a slimy beast would take his
“bump” when he found the meshes of the net
closing around him.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon looking in at the open door.
The man still knelt there on the hard earthen
floor of the shack, and appeared to be nervously
fumbling the sheaf of bills, as though trying to
count them, and be assured that he had received
the full amount to which he was entitled—that
there had been no “holdout” attempted.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps one of them happened to make a
slight sound—either that, or else the man’s guilty
soul caused him to fancy he heard something
for he turned his head. It chanced that the
light of the lantern fell full upon his dark face,
and disclosed the distended eyes filled with terror,
as well as the expression so ghastly that
passed athwart his countenance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put ’em up!” commanded Jack, sharply, in
a voice that would brook no nonsense and as if
mechanically influenced to obey, the wretched
trapped distributor of bad notes raised both
hands, the packet falling to the floor as if his
nerveless fingers could no longer retain their
grip.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and Perk stepped blithely into the
lighted shack, the former with his ready automatic
covering the badly shaken rogue, Perk
trailing his rifle in a suggestive way, as if able
to back his boss up on the slightest provocation.</p>

<p class='c013'>First frisking the other, and removing a gun
from his back pocket, Jack made a motion with
his hand as he set Perk to work.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get the bracelets on him, partner, then we’ll
ask him a few leading questions before we make
up our minds what the next step’ll be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But—hold on, Mister,” whined the poor
devil, all aquiver as he groveled there on his
knees; “I ain’t done nawthin’—this hear ain’t
my stuff—I jest suspicioned Jud he must a had
somethin’ hid out this way, ’case he kep’ comin’
an’ agoin’, so I kim tuh see what it mout be. Now
I knows he must a robbed thet bank over in
Tucson when he went off with a gang he runs
with.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stow that gab,” said the disgusted Perk,
“that’s all too flimsy to wash. We got you to
rights an’ where the hair’s short, an’ you’ll have
a chanct to see what the inside o’ the pen at Atlanta’s
like. This here’s counterfeit long-green,
an’ you knows it, mister,” with which cutting
remark he snapped a pair of steel handcuffs
upon the other’s wrists with the skill only one
accustomed to handling such “safety-first” contraptions
could display, proving that for one of
Slippery Slim’s active lieutenants the show was
indeed over.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch21' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXI <br /> <br />PICKING UP CLUES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>By this time the man whom Uncle Sam’s two
clever sky detectives had trapped, showed signs
of being almost in a state of collapse. Too late
did he realize what a terrible mistake he had
made when yielding to the blandishments of
Slippery Slim Garrabrant, and acting under the
belief that he could defy the law and get away
with it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the big idea, partner,” Perk was asking
after he and Jack had fixed things so there
was no possible chance for their prisoner to
break away, and give them the laugh. “Do we
jump off right now, or wait till mornin’, I’d like
to know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No hurry at all,” was the calm reply, “I
want to go over our crate once more before we
start that hop across to the California border,
I’ve good reason to believe things are okay but
a second overhauling will satisfy me better.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I kinder guess you won’t want me to slip
over to this here town, an’ pick up a few fresh
eggs, eh, boss?” and Perk’s voice actually took
on a wheedling vein as he made this remark
for if there was anything he dearly loved along
the line of “eats” it was those same “fresh eggs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack shook his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hardly think it would be wise,” he observed;
“we don’t know the lay of the land for one thing—it
might be this party has some backing among
his neighbors, and we’d find ourselves in a hornets’
nest before we knew what was what. No,
we can stick it out here the balance of the night,
which is pretty well gone right now, and be off
about sunrise.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a lot more stuff around in here that’d
burn right well,” insinuated Perk; “how ’bout
another bit o’ fire—this night air feels some cool
to me an’ ’sides, we’d have a blaze ready so’s to
boil more coffee ’fore we kick off, eh, what,
partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Please yourself so far as that goes, Perk, I
reckon it wouldn’t feel at all bad to have some
fire, as we must hang out here several hours.
But don’t make any noise if you can help it.
Besides, we ought to keep an eye out for trouble,
no telling what this slick chap might work off
on us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! we’ll one o’ us keep watch off’n on,”
promised Perk, starting without any further delay
to gather some fuel, and get a blaze going.</p>

<p class='c013'>While he was thus engaged Jack took their
prisoner in hand, and commenced to grill him.
There was nothing of the dreaded “third degree”
rough-house measures in what Jack attempted
but he tried to show the man where his best interests
lay.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re in a bad fix, my friend,” Jack told
him: “and unless you come clean, so as to help
us round up the balance of your outfit, you’ll
be certain to get the full penalty the law lays
down. We know a whole lot about Slippery
Slim and his ways, and are dead certain we’re
bound to end up his graft before many more
days pass by. So when you’re answering my
questions don’t try to lie to me, for like as not
I’ll be already acquainted with the facts and
know you’re trying to beat around the bush.
Dangerous business, let me tell you; far better
for you to hold your tongue than deceive me.
Come clean, and I promise you I’ll do everything
in my power to have you let off easy, besides no
one need know you’ve turned State’s evidence.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he started in to put pointed questions,
concerning certain points that were vital to his
plans. Once he caught the man squirming under
the lash, and giving an answer that he very well
knew was like “beating around the bush.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know better than that, my friend,” he
told him sharply, “that’s only half a truth you’ve
given me. Don’t try it again if you know what’s
good for your health, or it’ll be a matter of possibly
ten years before you see your family again.
Stick to the truth, and it may be only a question
of six months you’ll spend at Atlanta behind the
bars. Now tell me again what I wanted to know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He had managed to impress his strong personality
upon the writhing wretch, who was
ready to throw himself unreservedly upon his
mercy and so the answers were given without
hesitation, although in some instances the man
declared he did not know, as he had only once
been across the line and visited Slippery Slim
in his hideout among the Mexican mountains.</p>

<p class='c013'>When Jack realized that he had really pumped
the other dry, he felt he had profited in many
ways and that their sudden determination to
make, a night landing, so as to recover after their
buffeting by the storm, had been a most fortunate
happening indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>For one thing he had learned that the name
of their frightened prisoner was Simeon Hawkins,
and that he had a wife and several children
living in the little prairie town only a few miles
distant—a fact that seemed to give him great
distress, now he found his avaricious dreams
wrecked, and himself in the hands of a couple
of those very same Secret Service detectives
whom the “big boss” had undoubtedly referred
to so contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had been “listening in,” and chuckling
happily whenever he realized his mate had made
some sort of a “ten-strike,” picking up valuable
information that was destined to ultimately
serve their ends wonderfully, and help to “pot
their game.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They sat there for some time, talking in low
tones. The man who lay close by helpless was
silent as a rule, although several times he uttered
a dismal groan, when his feelings overpowered
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess I’ll step out, partner,” remarked Perk
at one time, “an’ slip over to the ship, I’d sure
hate to have some critter do us a bad turn by
meddlin’ with any o’ them dials an’ gadgets.
What I wouldn’t do to <i>him</i> would be a caution,
that’s right.”</p>

<p class='c013'>From the fact that Perk carried his rifle along
with him his meaning was not difficult to understand
and Jack felt sorry for the chap who was
at the other end of the gun sights when his pal
pulled the trigger.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk cautiously approached the grounded
ship, and started when discovering some moving
object just in its shadow. The moon was shining
brightly now, so that it was an easy matter to see
for quite some little distance, although so deceptive
was the light that even sharp-eyed Perk
could hardly have told whether some dark object
seen fifty feet off was a stump or a black dog
sitting there and watching him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Waiting until the object moved again, he discovered
he had been wise to hold his fire, for by
then he had made it out to be some species of
animal. He took several forward steps, whereupon
the beast started to move off, uttering a
little nasty snarl while doing so.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks, on’y a stinkin’ kiote after all, skulkin’
’round to see if he c’n stir up a little grub o’ any
kind. Get out, you varmint!” and he waved his
gun above his head while starting to run forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>This completely demoralized the cowardly
prairie marauder, so that he took to his heels,
and quickly vanished in the near distance. Perk
found everything all right when he gave the
stranded plane “the once over”; and being satisfied
that there was nothing to be feared from a
coyote prowling around in search of a supper or
breakfast, he returned to the shack to report all
well.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was busily engaged making certain notes,
and reading others connected with their present
business, as jotted down in his memorandum
book in a peculiar brand of short-hand all his
own, but which would appear as so much Greek
or Choctaw to any one else.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Better turn in, and get a few winks of sleep,
brother,” he told Perk, who had yawned once or
twice as he sat before the fire. “I’ll wake you up
in about an hour or so when you can take your
turn playing sentinel, until the dawn shows up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just as you say, old hoss,” came the ready
reply; “fact is, I’m a bit drowsy, an’ could get
away with a few winks; but don’t forget to wake
me when the hour’s up, remember.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s all right, partner,” Jack told him,
laughingly; “we’re in this game thirty-thirty,
and you’ll have your turn, depend on it. Now
get busy, and don’t you dare snore above a whisper
either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I do jest gimme a poke, Jack—tryin’ to
break myself o’ that nasty habit but I got to
have help, you know—no feller ain’t wholly responsible
fur what he does when he’s asleep.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In due time Jack aroused the other, and himself
sought a brief period of forgetfulness in
sleep. So the balance of the night passed, and
morning came with a clear sky, and a promise of
decent weather for the continuance of their
flight.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch22' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXII <br /> <br />OVER ARIZONA DESERTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Perk must have dreamed about that hot coffee
treat he had been promising himself, for when
Jack opened his eyes he found his comrade already
watching the bubbling pot, from which
delightful odors were commencing to escape in
the way of steam.</p>

<p class='c013'>They enjoyed quite a decent little breakfast,
what with the ambrosia contained in their aluminum
cups together with some crackers and jam,
after the crisp bacon had been disposed of. Jack
offered some to their prisoner, but the man sadly
shook his head, as if to say he had no appetite
whatever.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was not a bad looking fellow, only with a
weak sort of chin, and evidently built along a
line that could be easily tempted to go wrong if
the inducement were only gilded enough. Jack
felt sorry for him, especially since he had learned
about his family; and was determined to do what
he could so as to get Simeon off, should his information
prove of any value to their cause.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once breakfast was disposed of they all went
over to where the ship lay. By this time Simeon
had found that they really planned to carry him
off with them, a startling fact that added to his
alarm, for apparently he had never been up in
a plane, and a species of stage-fright made him
shake as if he had the ague.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there was no other way to work things,
for should they set him free the chances were
the man, forgetting his promise, would try to
send out some kind of warning to Slippery Slim,
and in the end he and Perk were apt to pay dearly
for their slip-up, perhaps even with their own
lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>When playing such a desperate game with so
canny a lawbreaker it would be the height of
folly to let the dictates of tender hearts turn
them from the path of “safety first,” and Simeon
must continue to “take his medicine,” even
though the innocent ones at home suffered for
his misdeeds—he had never considered others
whom his evil actions had doubtless harmed,
when they found themselves arrested for passing
worthless bills, and how could he expect these
sworn officers of the law to go easy with him
when caught in the act?</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk now began to wonder just how they
would be able to “tote” a third party in the limited
accommodations afforded by the double
cockpit of their ship. It was bound to prove a
tight squeeze, and not so comfortable but then
why grumble on account of a trifle like that,
when Fortune was giving them such a glad hand
all the while?</p>

<p class='c013'>He began to shift things around some while
Jack was busy checking the motor, struts, undergear,
and propeller, with the design of condensing,
and making more room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Funny how you c’n jam things into such a
small compass when you really an’ truly try,”
he told Jack, when he had finished his task. “I
kinder guess I’ll be able to fix him okay, ’cause
he’s no great shakes at size, an’, seems like to
me, he’s shrinkin’ right afore my eyes, he’s that
shaky. Then it’s only for the day, I figger; how
’bout that, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve planned all that out, partner,” he was
told. “As soon as we get over to the California
border we’ll give him in charge of some sheriff
to keep in the hoosgow till we’ve made our killing,
and are ready to deliver the whole batch to
Uncle Sam’s nearest U. S. District Attorney,
at Los Angeles or San Diego. That clear to you,
Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say it was, boss, an’ here’s hopin’ we’ll
get there with both feet when the end shows up,
our prisoners hobbled, an’ with nice new steel
bracelets decoratin’ their wrists. Now to get
the gent aboard the boat, an’ stowed away.
Shucks! he acts like he might be scared out o’ a
year’s growth—some sillies get that way ’bout
goin’ up in a skyscraper the fust time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>His scorn for such a weakling showed in his
face as he helped Simeon to clamber into the
cockpit. The man was as white as a sheet, and
trembling as if expecting to meet with some dire
end in short order, once he left the firm ground
and took to the boundless air. His groans were
heartrending, and Jack felt sorry for the wretch
but for once Perk displayed no signs of sympathy,
it was all so silly in his opinion.</p>

<p class='c013'>He proceeded to take precautions by fastening
the greenhorn in by means of a stout strap which
would prevent his falling out should conditions
necessitate a sudden banking on the part of the
pilot, or a fierce gust of wind cause the ship to
give a unannounced plunge.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All ready, Jack,” announced Perk, after
completing these arrangements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll be with you inside of three minutes,” he
was told, and as the ground ahead had been examined,
and found to be fairly good for the
wheels to trundle over, there seemed to be nothing
more that could be done, only put things to
the test.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was “some rough,” as Perk told himself,
when violently shaken once or twice but they
managed to get up sufficient speed to admit of
Jack lifting her when the right time arrived.
Then they were off, rising like a bird, and almost
immediately opening up the village that nestled
there two miles off, at the foot of the low ridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack headed straight into the west, for that
was their route “as the crow flew.” He cared
not at all that they would pass directly over the
settlement, for few of the people were apt to be
abroad at such an early hour, nor would they
be any the wiser for seeing a plane pass overhead
at such a low altitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, looking down, found himself wondering
which of the modest cottages in line of his vision
chanced to be the home Simeon had spoken of
with such a catch in his voice. The man had
temporarily forgotten about his fears concerning
his own safety, while being carried so high above
the surface of the earth—he was stretching his
neck, and eagerly focussing his staring eyes on
one spot, which evidently held all that he held
dear. Perk ignored his recent sensation of scorn,
and actually felt sorry for the man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor guy,” he was saying under his breath,
though the other could not have heard him had
he shouted at the top of his lungs, on account of
the racket being kicked up by combined motor
and propeller, “he feels right bad ’cause he’s
goin’ off without a chanct to say goodbye. Well,
I on’y hope this will be a lesson to Simeon, an’
he’ll quit playin’ with a buzz-saw, which is the
long arm o’ our Uncle Samuel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon tried his best to keep tabs of the lonely
little hamlet until it was no longer possible to
distinguish objects, owing to the several miles
of distance the speeding plane had covered; then
he fell back in his seat, and let his head drop
on his chest, while his body shook with emotion.
In that dreadful moment he would undoubtedly
have only too gladly given all he had in the wide
world for a chance to undo the wrongs he had
committed in his haste to get rich.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! he orter thought o’ that before, while
the goin’ was good!” was Perk’s comment, who
had seen just such short-sighted men more than
once before in his eventful life, and had a philosophical
mind concerning all such late repentances.
“But I’m sure sorry for them that are
agoin’ to suffer the most—he deserves all he’ll
get, but they’re the innocent ducks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The plane soared along its set course, and as
they were not at more than something like five
thousand feet altitude, Perk could see very well,
when he adjusted the binoculars they carried of
necessity, so as to be able to spy out conditions
before trusting themselves to land, being naturally
a bit suspicious while thus drawing steadily
nearer to what might well be called enemy land.</p>

<p class='c013'>From time to time he found himself gazing
down with considerable curiosity upon scenes
which were mostly foreign to his eyes—he had
only too often scrutinized pictures where uncounted
troops belonging to the enemy were encamped,
or on the march, with monster guns
making the very air quiver with the tumult of
their discharges; where rival pilots came up in
answer to his insulting challenge, to engage him
in deadly combat—he had seen many an unlucky
or less skillful airman go down with his whirling,
blazing coffin, yielding up his life as a tribute
to what he called patriotism—all these and a
multitude of similar thrilling spectacles could
be unrolled in memory as he thus sailed the
azure sky, and saw Jack meet and conquer successive
air pockets lying in wait to give him battle;
and yet this was actually the first time Perk
had ever focussed his gaze upon a genuine cattle
ranch, and saw stock being driven to market,
or it might be mavericks branded; so that he
found himself entranced with the panorama
spread before him as they glided over the prairies
of New Mexico.</p>

<p class='c013'>There cropped up other and like interesting
sights when the wilder sector of country was
reached, with its deep gullies, its bare-topped
mountain peaks—perhaps stretches of desolate
desert where nothing could be seen save billowy
sandy wastes, except possibly patches of yucca,
sage, greasewood, and prickly pear cactus.</p>

<p class='c013'>When, his interest increasing, Perk begged
his comrade to drop down so as to give him a
nearer view of these strange sights, he was able
to increase his knowledge concerning the myriad
of strange sights to be picked up when touring
by air in new territories—now he could make
out the fantastic Joshua trees that seemed to be
engaged in a shimmering dance in the blazing
sunlight; moving shadows that sometimes crossed
the line of his vision he made out to be buzzards
on the wing, circling in search of their carrion
meal; while others on the ground he recognized
as coyotes skulking along, frightened by the sight
and noise coming from far over their heads, and
trying to reach their secret dens in some rocky
canyon or defile.</p>

<p class='c013'>Noon came in due time, with the ship keeping
up its steady grind, and having left hundreds of
miles in its wake.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk began to realize that he had eaten his
breakfast at an unearthly hour, and concluding
that a bite of something, together with a swig of
water from their jug, might go well, he mentioned
the interesting fact that the usual lunch
hour had come, at which Jack nodded his head,
as if to leave all that sort of thing to the discretion
of his trusted pard.</p>

<p class='c013'>So they had a pick-up snack, which was quite
acceptable to the two airmen, able to enjoy their
meals even while cutting capers up among the
clouds. It was another thing to the novice
Simeon, whose appetite had not come back,
though he did manage to swallow a few bites,
and have a drink of cold water to wash things
down. By slow degrees he was getting the upper
hand of his dreadful fears, for while familiarity
could not be said to bring contempt, nevertheless
he was becoming accustomed to the conditions,
and could even display a trace of curiosity
when looking down on some unusually interesting
spectacle to which Perk was pointing so
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>If things continued to exist as they had been
doing all morning it was likely—Jack at one time
told his co-pilot in answer to a question—that
they would be close to the California border by
sunset, or shortly afterwards; since even then
they were well along across Arizona, with fair
skies still beckoning them on their way.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch23' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIII <br /> <br />ON TO THE COLORADO</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Listen, Perk, I’ve got something you should
know—something that hinges on a change of
plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was saying this at a time when, relieved
from the controls he could enter into one of the
little confabs that their use of the ear-phones
allowed. All Perk had to do was to lean forward
and while still handling the stick drink
in whatever his co-pilot chose to say.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! spit it out then, partner,” was his familiar
way of inviting confidence and which
meant so much with those who knew Perk’s peculiar
sayings best.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be sure Simeon Hawkins was sitting close
beside Perk, and what Jack meant to confide in
his running mate could never be intended for
his ears but despite this elbow to elbow touch
there was not the slightest risk of his being able
to pick up a single word, owing to the clamor
kicked up by motor exhaust and propeller.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re going on a bit further than was arranged,”
said Jack, concisely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! meanin’ we don’t pull up when we
strike the border, eh, what, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just that, brother—the going is good, and
we might as well keep moving till we drop down
on the Metropolitan Airport grounds.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whoopee! you mean at Los Angeles, don’t
you, old hoss?” demanded Perk, apparently considerably
surprised by his pal’s bald statement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Righto, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How come, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get this fixed in your noodle,” said the resting
chief pilot—“circumstances often alter cases,
they tell us; well, when we figured on halting at
or near the border, close to the Gila River,
things hadn’t happened such as have hit us since
then.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Meanin’ the storm, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was one thing,” admitted the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Knockin’ us out o’ our reckonin’, like, an’
makin’ us take a forced landin’ on the open
prairie where we run across that flimsy ol’ shack—does
that cover what you mean, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“After a fashion it does,” the other told him,
adding: “like the play of Hamlet, with Hamlet
left out, it falls flat. You omitted the chief reason
for my making this change in plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess you must mean Simeon here, eh
boy?” asked Perk, as if suddenly waking up to
the fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing—what are we going to do with
<i>him</i>, tell me, Perk? It’d be impossible for us
to lug him everywhere we mean to go, flying
across into Mexico, and baiting the wolf in his
own lair, as you might say. He’d be a constant
hindrance to our being free to act besides, we’d
run a fat chance of having him give us away,
just when we thought it was all over but the
shouting.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, Jack—it means you don’t trust his
promises to lend us a helpin’ hand, and goin’
back on his pals—ain’t that the idea?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it,” replied Jack, never bothering
to drop his voice a particle, knowing as he did
that without the aid of those valuable ear-phones
Simeon, humped up against the side of Perk,
could not have caught what was said even
though it had been shouted at the top of his
voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what then, partner?” continued Perk,
apparently still groping in the dark.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing to hinder our tripping right along
till we fetch up at Angeles, when we can find a
way to hand him over to the Federal agents located
there. He’s connected with the big gang
against which Uncle Sam’s declared war to the
knife; and as a material witness, ready to turn
State’s evidence, they’ll be only too well pleased
to hold him <i>incommunicado</i>, so he can’t do a
thing to warn the bunch the big push is on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Okay, Jack. Sounds mighty good to me,
you bet. I’d never a cudgeled my brains enough
to hatch up an idea like that; takes you to think
o’ clever dodges, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then we’ll consider it settled, eh, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just what we will,” came the confident reply.
“’Bout when ought we raise the last beacon
on the road to Angeles, an’ lamp the field
lights at that same Metropolitan Airport?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! if everything goes well, you might call
it along toward midnight,” Jack assured him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got aplenty o’ gas to carry on that far, I’d
guess?” hazarded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s to be hoped so,” said Jack; “because
there’s some mighty tough stretches of country
between the Colorado and the big Pacific city.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! so I understand, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And it would be a bad job for us if we had
to hit the ground where you couldn’t scrape up
a decent landing place with a fine-tooth comb.
When I take the stick again, Perk, maybe you’d
better have a look in, so’s to get tabs on our fuel
tank, and tell me how it stands. From the dial
finger yonder I figure we’ll have a lot more than
enough to see us through.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s right, boss,” affirmed Perk, after casting
a hasty glance at the tell-tale figures so
plainly marked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That settles it then,” with which remark
Jack showed by his actions that further conversation
was needless.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Simeon sat there through it all, never
once dreaming how his fate was being so calmly
settled; doubtless he imagined the consultation
had been about something connected with the
running of the cloud-chaser, and covered facts
such as would have been all Greek to him, even
had he been able to listen in.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was not at all bothered by this change
of plans on the part of the head pilot—it mattered
little when they managed to drop down at
the airport—chances were the ground lights
were kept on full through the whole of each
night, since air mail planes would be apt to
come and go, some of them having been thrown
out of their regular schedules by dense mountain
fogs, or head winds that cut down the customary
speed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, also, was well acquainted with the
courtesy to be encountered at all such well conducted
flying fields, where every one would be
eager to do whatever was possible for the comfort
of those who chose to visit such ports, and
show little or no undo curiosity connected with
the reason for their coming.</p>

<p class='c013'>True, they might turn out to be a bit short
with the “eats;” but Perk, who knew the ways
of his pal so well, felt certain Jack would see to
it they had a chance to “fill up” as soon as they
could strike an open restaurant, of which there
should be no lack in such a wide-open city as
Los Angeles, with its sporty crowds at Hollywood.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was moving on apace, and
there cropped up fresh thrilling sights every little
while, for Perk to stare at through his useful
glasses. They were following the course of
the famous Gila River toward its confluence
with the still better known Colorado, which
hundreds of miles further north passed through
the Grand Canyon country, most majestic in a
panorama sense of any region on the face of the
globe.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along about nightfall they might expect to
pass over Yuma, located close to the junction of
the two rivers. Perk wondered once or twice
why his pal had not decided to land there, and
turn the prisoner over to some one in authority;
but he felt certain Jack had good reasons for
not attempting this.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe, now,” Perk told himself, with Jack
again running the ship, while he attended to
some of his own manifold duties; “he
guessed there might be a bad crowd at Yuma—fellers
apt to be in cahoots with the same
gang o’ daredevils Simeon here was connected
with; and who might even try to effect his escape,
so as to shut his trap—even go so far as to
knife the poor skunk to make sure he didn’t
peach. Oh! yeah, that’s the way Jack looked
at it, bet your boots it must be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Soon afterwards the sun gave notice that it
was about to withdraw behind the line of mountains
lying toward the west. Jack had his bearings,
and expected to be able to pick up the flash
beacons arranged for the convenience of the air
mail corps in their night flights to and from Los
Angeles. So thoroughly has this all been
mapped out, with the signals to be found about
every ten miles, that a pilot can see as many as
three ahead at one time, depending on the altitude
at which he may be flying.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such wise precautions had been taken that
would make night flying just as safe and easy as
during the daytime one thing only cropping up
from time to time to raise trouble, and cause delay
was the presence of the fogs that were apt
to rise from the deep canyons, to blot out those
friendly gleams of flashing light marking the
air mail course from start to finish.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch24' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIV <br /> <br />SIMEON GROWS DESPERATE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was commencing to grow dusk when they
sighted the lights of Yuma, that town on the railroad
leading to Los Angeles. Such a thing as a
plane flying overhead was so common these modern
days as to hardly excite any comment—they
came and went, with seldom anything out of the
usual taking place although not so very far
away, among the mountains, one of the most
dreadful of all air tragedies known to the annals
of flying had taken place, when the great
liner <i>City of San Francisco</i>, lost in a storm,
struck head-on against a rocky cliff, shattering
the ship and causing the death of every one of
those aboard, some seven souls in all.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now they had left Yuma far in their rear, and
Jack was watching to pick up the first flash beacon
on the way to the Coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>The weather continued to favor them, the
heavens being almost devoid of any semblance of
clouds, and the air quite cool at the height they
maintained while heading into the beckoning
west.</p>

<p class='c013'>Over deserts and mountainous stretches they
kept swinging along, to the constant accompaniment
of the customary chorus of a bustling plane
threading the mighty air lanes of the skies. The
silvery stars came out in battalions to sprinkle
the azure heavens like innumerable bright lanterns,
such as could be seen in Old Japan during
carnival times.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was the life, Perk told himself again and
again, sitting there after he had munched his
scanty portion of their meagre supper, Simeon
having again declined to share with them—what
air pilot who has tasted of the joys of such hours
could ever dream of forsaking his vocation, so
long as Fortune allowed him to retain his vision,
hearing, and the faculty for guiding an onrushing
ship through the realms of unlimited space—not
he for one, Perk assured himself, drawing in
huge draughts of the clear air, and watching the
wonderful beacons as they passed them by,
threading the pathway of the stars as it were,
straight toward their distant goal.</p>

<p class='c013'>The night wore on, with the voyagers making
splendid progress.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had made no miscalculation when saying
he believed they would fetch up at their destination
somewhere about the midnight hour; for
it still lacked more or less of that time when in
the near distance they glimpsed lights telling
that the city, and its nearby aviation field, must
be close at hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they found themselves circling over the
port, which, just as Jack had fancied would be
the case, was lighted most brilliantly. Even as
they sighted the field they noted a ship settling
down, evidently an air mail plane that had
been held up by some dense fog belt which they
had fortunately missed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Soft snap I’d call it, droppin’ down with all
them field lights to show the ground, so a feller
c’n see a rock the size o’ a baseball,” was what
the tickled Perk was telling himself while Jack
was proceeding to make the terminal drop, with
several ground attendants hurrying up so as to
lend any assistance needed.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had received his instructions from Jack,
and removed the handcuffs from the wrists of
the prisoner. There was no necessity for letting
everybody know the facts and the sight of a
man wearing steel bracelets, and gripped by an
attendant never fails to excite keen curiosity with
most people and especially would this be the
case if he had just come by the air route from
some unknown and therefore mysterious quarter.</p>

<p class='c013'>He would keep his arm through that of
Simeon, and inform him in a forcible whisper
that should he attempt any “funny business” it
would be at the risk of being shot down without
further warning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack would attend to everything necessary,
such as having their crate stowed away in some
convenient hangar, where it could be recovered
at any time, by paying such charges as were
customary.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be sure Perk was questioned by several of
the men while Jack saw that the ship was being
taken care of but when he chose, Perk could keep
a still tongue in his head and since he paid no
attention to what was said, and never opened his
mouth in the least, possibly they concluded he
must be both deaf and dumb.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk may have chuckled deep down in his
throat when he heard a few of the disgusted
remarks some of the men exchanged concerning
his lack of speech and hearing but
he kept his own counsel; and in the end Jack
came up saying he had secured a taxi to carry
them to a small hotel down in the heart of the
city, recommended by one of the hostlers who
seemed to know what he was talking about.</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon had looked a bit anxious, as though
wondering how their arrival at Los Angeles
would affect his wretched fortunes but he made
no attempt to appeal to the crowd for help.
Undoubtedly he was firmly convinced that the
grim Perk must be a man of his word, and that
any attempt on his part to break away would
prove a most serious matter indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah!” Perk was telling himself under his
breath when he took note of this humble disposition
on the part of Simeon, “Guess now he feels
it’s a heap better to be a live fool than a dead
hero; an’ by jinks I don’t blame the beggar for
thinkin’ thataways either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon all three safely lodged in the
taxi—which fortunately had remained up to this
late hour, the driver hoping to pick up a fare—and
heading for the nearby city.</p>

<p class='c013'>Later on they entered the small hotel, and
found it all the obliging ground attache at the
port had said. Jack registered the party, all of
them under fictitious names, since it paid to exercise
due caution when on the track of big game
just as it would for the big game hunter to make
no sound when advancing upon an enormous
tusker or “rogue” elephant whose spoor he had
been trailing through forest and jungle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Would it be possible for us to have some
supper sent up to our room?” Jack asked the
night clerk who shrugged his shoulders as if
dubious concerning his ability to accommodate
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kindly try to have it done, if double price
will have any effect,” continued Jack, using his
most gracious smile that usually accomplished
his purpose and at that the clerk responded by
saying he would do his best but it was of course
most unusual, and he hoped they would not make
any complaint if the variety was not all they
might wish.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quantity is the chief thing that interests
us,” said Jack; “you see, we have come
by air, and fell short of food while on our way,
so that my two pals here are very near being
starved; so whatever you send make it a fairly
bountiful spread, please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they were shown to their room, which
contained a double bed and a cot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I kinder guess now, partner,” said Perk, after
flashing a glance around the apartment, fronting
on a back lot, though up in the third story of the
building, “you an’ me better share the bed, while
Simeon gets his little nap on the sofy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That goes, Perk,” his comrade told him
“and after we’ve had supper we’ll hit the hay.
After such a broken night as we had back a ways
some sleep ought to be welcome, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! hope we don’t have to wait too tarnel
long for the grub,” Perk was saying, dismally
rubbing his stomach, as if to show how flat it
seemed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack engaged him in conversation of a general
character, just to keep his mind from dwelling
on the subject of eating for once Perk let himself
believe he was in danger of famishing and
he just could not subside but must commence
to marshal all the known dishes of which he was
especially fond, and keep on taunting and tantalizing
himself by stringing them off as might a
glib-tongued waiter in any restaurant.</p>

<p class='c013'>After quite a tiresome wait there was a knock
at the door, which Perk hastened to answer.
Two waiters strode in, bearing trays laden
with a pretty substantial assortment of food—quite
a satisfactory display, Jack thought, considering
the late hour, and that probably the regular
kitchen force must have long ago turned in
or else gone home.</p>

<p class='c013'>The table fairly groaned under the assortment—Perk
pertinently mentioned the fact,
adding that he guessed he’d do his share of
groaning <i>after</i> he had finished his supper which
Jack did not doubt in the least, having a knowledge
concerning the other’s vast appetite, and
unbridled disposition to make a pig of himself
at such times when food was plentiful.</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon Hawkins was coaxed to sit down with
them and as his state of mind seemed to have
improved quite a little, he also partook of food
of which he most certainly was much in need,
having fasted so long and abstemiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>When this ceremony had been carried through
to a finish, the supply of visible victuals had been
wonderfully reduced; and even Perk was heard
to declare he could not eat another bite, which
meant he was like a stuffed turkey, fit for the
Thanksgiving table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before turning in, Perk took occasion to “talk
like a Dutch uncle,” as he termed it, to Simeon,
assuring him he need not be in too upset a state
of mind concerning his future, since Jack had
said he was bound to do all he could to have him
let go, because of what he had confided to them,
and such assistance he would be able to lend the
Government in convicting the head men of the
lawless conspiracy along the counterfeiting line.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other nodded his head as though he
understood that, having embarked in the game
of throwing down Slippery Slim, he realized
there was nothing else for him to do but go
through to the windup.</p>

<p class='c013'>So confiding Perk, thinking things would run
smoothly, took off some of his outer garments,
and rolled into bed, as it afterwards turned out,
happily choosing that side of the same nearest
to the windows of their room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack soon followed, and the last thing he noticed
ere snapping off the light was the humbled
Simeon wrapped in a blanket, and lying there
flat on his back, as though meaning to get what
sleep he could during that fragment of the night
still remaining.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was, so far as appearances went, sound
asleep; but then sometimes things are not just
what they seem. To tell the truth, Perk had
made up his mind ere lying down that he would
“sleep with one eye open,” as he called it, meaning
it was his intention to keep on the alert, ready
to jump out of bed at the least sign of trouble.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps when he thus decided it was with a
hazy idea they might have some sort of unwelcome
visitor during the night; he could not just
decide how this could be but then those unprincipled
agents of the counterfeiter king—like
the fellow who had rifled the belongings of
Scotty, the air mail pilot in Atlanta—were liable
to turn up anywhere, everywhere, when least expected,
and try to manipulate their bold games.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hearing some sort of sound as of a person
moving, Perk suddenly sat straight up in bed,
to see their prisoner in the act of crawling over
the sill of the nearby window, evidently bent on
giving them the slip!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch25' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXV <br /> <br />THE STAGE SET FOR BATTLE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Hey! you, lay off that stuff!” was the way
Perk exploded, even as he made a wild dash
across the floor, and clutched the reckless Simeon
by the arm, dragging him back into the room
by sheer strength.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other struggled but feebly perhaps he
was really horrified at the desperate chances he
had been about to take.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, you must be goofy, Hawkins, to try that
sort o’ game!” Perk went on scornfully,
as the wretched man writhed on the floor where
he had flung him. “Don’t you know it’s two
stories down to the roof o’ that extension; an’
chances are you’d a got a broken neck, or leg,
in the drop. Better make up your mind to take
the medicine an’ stand it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack of course had been aroused at the first
movement of his chum, and sat up in bed watching
the actions of the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Trying to take leg bail, was he, Perk?” he
remarked. “You can hardly blame the poor
dick, come to think of it because he’s rubbing
up against a tough proposition. Better put the
bracelets on him again, and tie his ankles together
he might get loco, and try to jump out
of a window, just to end it all and that would
be too bad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon, utterly cowed and silent, made no resistance
when Perk followed out his pal’s advice.
There were several hours of the night still remaining,
and they might as well secure such
sleep as lay in their power, since no one could
predict what sort of strenuous activity awaited
them in the near future.</p>

<p class='c013'>Came morning, and the two air detectives
were stirring.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another right fine mornin’ for us,” Perk remarked,
blithely, as he looked out of the window,
and made a grimace at seeing what a nasty
drop had awaited the desperate prisoner had he
succeeded in carrying out his plan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! that’s the usual program, I understand,
out here on the Coast,” Jack told him. “Hardly
ever see any rain in this blessed country; that’s
why they have to depend on irrigation for their
crops.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Plenty to keep us hoppin’ today, I kinder
guess, partner, eh, what?” volunteered Perk, as
he started dressing, after removing the stout
cords that had been wrapped about the lower
limbs of the Federal prisoner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never said truer words, boy,” Jack
added “got to settle about this business of having
our friend here held until the gate’s been
crashed, and our scoop put through. Then I
mean to have a good talk with several people in
the Government offices, who can give us a few
points that so far we’ve been missing. You can’t
pick up too much information when aiming to
stack up against smart lads like this Slippery
Slim. He’s got so many eyes on the watch the
chap who expects to corral <i>him</i> must get up right
early in the morning, and pull the wires in a
dozen different directions. I’d a heap rather
overdo the matter of taking precautions than to
let just one ragged end get loose, for a game like
this is only as strong as its weakest link.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do we eat here, or look up a restaurant?”
asked Perk, quite naturally, since it was the
easiest thing in the world for his thoughts to
turn toward the subject of catering to the loud
demands of his stomach, when the usual time
for meals came around.</p>

<p class='c013'>“On the whole I reckon it’d be as well for us
to stick around, and have breakfast fetched up
here,” suggested jack. “I’ll step down presently,
and see if it can be managed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just as you say, partner,” Perk told him,
grinning, to add: “Make her two fried eggs and
a rasher o’ bacon for me; also a big cup o’ coffee
with a stack o’ wheats done brown. Say, you
might add some toast, and an orange, seein’ that
this is California, an’ a feller ought to patronize
the fruit industry when happenin’ to visit the
Coast country. Guess that ought to fill a vacuum
okay, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Leave it to me, Perk, and you’ll never starve
to death I’m a good provider, and Uncle Sam
foots the chuck wagon bill.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When later on two waiters appeared laden
down with a mass of dishes, Perk grinned some
more, and looked quite joyous; for the odor of
coffee and bacon always pleased his sense of smell
as nothing else could.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Simeon had apparently about decided to
make the best of a bad bargain, for he began
sniffing as though the idea of breakfast appealed
to him—he certainly needed something to brace
him up.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along about ten o’clock they prepared to set
out for the offices of the Federal forces in Los
Angeles. Simeon had finally given his word not
to make any further attempt at escape. Jack had
been talking seriously with the fellow ever since
breakfast, trying to squeeze further information
from him, and holding out hope that if he “came
clean” he might yet be allowed to go back to his
family after the Government had made use of
him to send the leaders in the wide flung conspiracy
to prison for long terms.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again a convenient taxi was called upon to
convey the trio to their intended destination.
Both Jack and Perk evinced considerable curiosity
concerning the unfamiliar sights on the
streets. They asked numerous questions of the
driver, who chanced to be a communicative sort
of fellow, and filled them up with information
about the sunny queen city of the Coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not long before Jack’s magical passport,
sanctioned by the Big Boss at Washington,
brought them in contact with several high officials
who apparently had been secretly apprized
of their presence in the West, and had
also been requested to afford the two daring sky
detectives all the assistance possible in carrying
out their plan of campaign.</p>

<p class='c013'>So it came about that Simeon was taken off
their hands, after the story of his capture had
been told. Jack secured a promise that the man
would be lightly dealt with because of the valuable
aid he had already afforded the sleuth-hounds
of the air branch of the Law.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both of them shook hands with the pitiful
looking chap as he was taken away by a marshal
who had been summoned and who would see
that he was kept aloof from all other prisoners
until his testimony was wanted in court.</p>

<p class='c013'>After that they fell into a general talk, Jack
telling the deeply interested officials about the
stirring adventures befalling himself and Perk
since they first struck Atlanta, where the drive
really had its beginning.</p>

<p class='c013'>In return he was given such information as
had been gathered in connection with more recent
happenings along the line of Slippery Slim’s
operations and the fact of the matter was there
always seemed to be fresh outbreaks of the bogus
money disease in this or that part of the whole
Southwest, as new agents started to work virgin
territory until by this time the greatest unrest
and uneasiness existed among all Government
ranks.</p>

<p class='c013'>The balance of that day the two pals put in
taking a look around the city, visiting Hollywood,
and seeing a number of movie stars whom
they recognized from familiarity with their faces
on the silver screen at various times.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack paid another visit to Federal Headquarters
on the succeeding day, to gather up all
loose ends, and decide on his plans while Perk
took himself off to look up some old friend, who,
he understood, was making good in one of the
new big pictures.</p>

<p class='c013'>They met again late in the afternoon, with
Perk displaying signs of nervous tension for
almost the first thing he said to his chum was in
the shape of a leading question, which Jack undoubtedly
anticipated, knowing Perk’s headlong
nature as he did, and the habit of the other for
seeking speedy action.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wal, what’s the good word, old hoss—when
do we skip out from here, if so be it’s all set?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No more hanging fire, brother,” Jack assured
him, smilingly “we’re loaded for bear this time,
sure pop. I’ve been out at the airport, and had
a full tank of gas put aboard the crate as well
as all that stuff you sent over so’s to keep us from,
starving to death.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bully boy!” crowed the delighted Perk; “jest
can’t come any too soon to please me. I’m only
cravin’ a chanct for a set-to with the head o’ this
flim-flam bunch, who’s laughed at the Government
boys just once too often. Is it tonight,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Midnight ought to see us several hundred
miles on our way, if all goes well,” Jack told
him, not displaying any outward signs of jubilation
himself, although he undoubtedly must be
thrilled by the thought of how they were now
about to put everything to the test, and match
their wits against that astute schemer, for whom
the Federal prison doors were yawning so widely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never gimme sweeter words, old pal!”
Perk was saying, backed up by one of his most
hideous grins.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch26' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVI <br /> <br />ON THE FACE OF THE MOON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Jack proved as good as his word, for they were
off shortly after nightfall, and headed almost
due east. No one at the aviation field had the
remotest idea as to who they were, what their
destination might be, and whence they came.
But then this particular port was becoming a
very important link in the trans-continental
chain, with lines of great passenger and freight
airships going and coming not to mention the
several speedy air mail boats that covered their
hundreds of miles day or night and as a rule on a
schedule that seemed as perfect as that of any
train time table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was unusually silent, at least for him.
Perhaps he was realizing at last the serious
nature of the job they had undertaken—that it
was rather a weighty proposition, such as was
bound to require all their united reserve force
to put across.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still, he had absolute confidence in Jack’s
ability to swing the undertaking, and also refused
to allow anything like doubt to assail him
with regard to their united courage.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was by this time well understood that the
climax, when it came, would occur on Mexican
soil for now that all accounts from every quarter
were in hand, they knew absolutely that the den
of the counterfeiting gang was in a secret cave
among the mountains of Sonora also that the
sagacious Slim had bought protection from certain
local Mexican officials, who were suspected
of secretly plotting a new revolution, and took
this means for obtaining the money needed to
purchase arms in the States.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was even said that Slim never flew back to
his headquarters without loading his swift plane
with a dead weight of guns and ammunition as
the price he had to pay for being allowed to operate
undisturbed on foreign soil.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A pretty kettle of fish, I’d call that sort o’
game,” Perk had indignantly asserted, when he
learned of this see-saw method of currying favor
with the plotting generals who hoped to once
again turn the country upside-down and kick
the present rulers out of office, as well as seize
the city banks with their rich booty.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so it was, but Jack realized how it accounted
for the long spell of immunity Slim had
enjoyed while he lined his pockets, and spread
that financial panic throughout the Southwestern
States. There never had been his equal as a skillful
worker and bold lawbreaker; one who knew
how to set neighbor against neighbor, and make
every one work so that he could rake off a heavy
dividend from each separate deal.</p>

<p class='c013'>So he had for a long time been coming and
going, crossing the border, as a rule by the air
route, carrying his cargoes of deceitful bank bills
to various distributing points—like the one Jack
and Perk had struck by sheer accident—gathering
the genuine stuff contributed by his numerous
dupes, and leaving bulky packages of the wonderfully
executed spurious notes in exchange.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a veritable Golconda for the industrious
worker, who, safe from interference, had kept
as busy as the proverbial bee, that stores honey
day after day.</p>

<p class='c013'>They followed the line of swirling beacons
the air mail boys were in the habit of trailing,
since by this means they could pass some of the
numerous danger spots on their route. In good
time Jack expected to turn his back on these
friendly flashing lights and head due south, to
cross the border, and fly over foreign territory.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had been placed in possession of certain
secret documents issued by the Mexican government,
which proved how they knew of the unholy
alliance made between Slim, the counterfeiter
king, and those traitorous generals who yearned
for fresh outbreaks so as to pamper their own
personal fortunes, just then at low ebb.</p>

<p class='c013'>There existed something of an arrangement,
whereby the Mexican government agreed to
stand back of any effort made by the Department
at Washington to capture Slim, smash his gang
that was widening its powers every day, and
clean out the mess of near-bandits with whom he
had allied himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>If it were necessary all arrangements had been
made whereby Colonel Jose Morales, with a
crack regiment of hard fighting regulars who
had seen much bloody service in bringing the
defiant Yaqui Indians to terms by invading their
mountain fastnesses, and meeting them hand-to-hand—was
stationed within a day’s ride of the
ravine where Slim had his plant and could be
summoned by means of certain smoke signals.
No sooner would these “talking smokes” be detected
than the order would be given “boots and
saddles,” with the mounted regiment in full
swing for the debatable ground where Slim had
his nefarious nest.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, too, had a secret arrangement been effected
with the old leader of the now defunct Texas
Rangers, most of whom were in the service of the
Government connected with the border patrol
and orders had been given the former gallant
hero that if a certain message were received, no
matter by what method, he was to gather a squad
of his old fighters, and cross the border, sure of
being warmly received by the loyal Mexican
troops who would welcome his assistance in wiping
out the sore spot that had been so long a blot
on their country’s honor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus it would seem that everything possible
had been done toward striking a telling blow.
It only remained for Jack Ralston to start the
ball rolling, when it must gain fresh impetus
with every revolution.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk acted as though decidedly pleased when
later on he discovered that they no longer followed
the flashing beacon trail—Jack had gone
as far as was judicious along that line and now
headed straight into the mysterious south, toward
the border of the neighboring republic where
disorder still held sway, and disgruntled chiefs
continued to plot against the rule of the recently
elected president.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every mile traversed now was bringing them
closer to their goal, and Perk found more or less
joy in picturing the thrilling climax, when they
would give Slippery Slim the surprise of his
life—if only no leak concerning their clever plan
had come about.</p>

<p class='c013'>The moon had risen, and was hanging there
in the east, a silvery shield with one edge clipped
off telling that the queen of the night was already
well past her “full” stage and running for
a fall.</p>

<p class='c013'>All at once Perk had an electric shock.</p>

<p class='c013'>He leaned convulsively forward and gripped
his mate by the shoulder, at the same time pointing
toward the southeast and shouting through
the head phones:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look, oh look—see what’s passing across the
moon, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then just as suddenly did he release his clutch,
to fall back in his seat, and exclaim most dramatically,
with a touch of disgust in his voice:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! It’s slipped past, dang the luck!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But I got it all right, Perk,” the pilot assured
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it <i>was</i> a ship, an’ my lamps didn’t fool
me, partner?” Perk cried in renewed excitement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As sure as you’re born, that’s what it was,
brother,” Jack added.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Headin’ south, same as we’re doin’ right now,
eh, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, buddy—just what the crate was
doing, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the answer—could it a been <i>him</i>, on
his way back home with a load o’ machine guns,
life they say he carries every time he crosses the
border, after takin’ out a freshly printed batch
o’ his flimsy stuff to soak on the honest folks back
home?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s something we can only make a stab
at,” replied Jack. “Chances lean that, way, I
must say; but just the same it might have been
some mail plane that’s got blown off its regular
course, and is beating it for the home port. Then
again I understand the border patrol are handling
a few ships in their line of intercepting flyers
making a business of smuggling Chinese aliens
across the line night-times.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d give a heap to know the answer to that
puzzle,” continued Perk, who disliked enigmas,
and all that sort of thing calculated to make a
fellow lie awake nights, bothering his poor
brains. He never had been fitted by Nature for
the job of being a real detective.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll never know,” his pal told him, “unless
it happens we run afoul of the other crate when
our courses draw closer together and if it’s Slim
whose fingers grip that stick we’d rather be excused
for having that happen—our job is to fetch
him back <i>alive</i>, and not make him lose his life
in a crash.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me, I ain’t peticular just what <i>does</i> happen
to the slick guy,” Perk wound up the little talkfest
by saying. “Only, when it comes to a real
showdown either Slim or us got to go to the
wall—dead or alive, the thing’s goin’ to be settled
for keeps!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch27' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVII <br /> <br />THE SIERRA MADRE CHAIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Another thing Perk noticed—this was the fact
that Jack seemed to have changed his mind with
regard to making haste for the ship was racing
along at top-notch speed, as though engaged
in a race with some unseen rival.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hey! what’s the big idea, Jack?” he called
out, when this thing had been going on for some
time, and his burning curiosity could no longer
be held in leash. “Why doin’ the sprintin’ act,
I’m awonderin’?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Less chance for us to run foul of that other
boat if we forge well ahead, don’t you see, partner?”
exclaimed the pilot, sententiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! that’s a fact,” returned the enlightened
Perk. “An’ then mebbe it’d be jest as well for us
to get there ahead o’ the boss in the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m aiming to do that,” he was told.
“It happens that we can’t keep on in the boat till
we strike close to his hideout—the racket would
stir the whole bunch up like a hornet’s nest you’ve
kicked when going through the brush, with the
mad critters swarming out to tackle you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you now, Big Boss—never did think
o’ that before. Then I kinder guess we’ll
have to hike some little way,” and there was a
vein of chagrin in the speaker’s voice as he mentioned
this fact, since walking and Perk never
did seem to agree very well—like most flyers he
had been spoiled for all manner of pedestrianism
by his ability to cover such vast distances
without moving his pedal extremities an iota.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s our sure enough program,” Jack told
him, doubtless thinking that the delayed knowledge
might allow his pal to make up his mind
about swallowing the bitter medicine without a
single grimace.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not long after this little break when
Jack again spoke:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve a good idea we’re across the line now,
partner,” was the information he passed along.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sounds good to me, okay,” commented Perk,
with a tinge of solid satisfaction visible in his
voice as though having a possible rough-house
job to handle, the sooner he got busy the sooner
it was likely to be over.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And making more than an even hundred
miles to the hour in the bargain, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some punkins about comin’ in swell on the
last lap, this crate sure is, I’d say, partner.
Licketty split she humps along like a reg’lar
witch. I guess now she’d make rings around
that ol’ boat Slim’s got hold o’ though it
answers his purpose seems like. But see here,
Jack, you never did tell me jest how you got word
to that same Colonel Morales down here in
Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was given my instructions, and sent a telegram
to him at Hermosilla, in care of Padre
Lopez, giving him the order he was expecting—during
the last hour we were in Los Angeles.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! then the sojers must be in the saddle
right now!” burst out Perk, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If the arrangement went through without a
miss that’s like enough a fact,” admitted Jack;
“the way my plan’s arranged everything must go
off with the regularity of machine work, each
separate part dovetailing, so as to work in full
sympathy. If anything lags, and goes amiss, it’s
apt to throw the whole scheme out of gear, you
understand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! I grab what you mean, partner,” said
the astounded Perk; “but I got to hand it to you
when it comes to hatchin’ up big things—it’s jest
wonderful how you manage. An’ I sure do hope
everything’ll slide along like greased lightnin’,
once it gets started.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had planned to drop down in some isolated
spot where with the coming of dawn, with
the aid of the strong glasses they could pick up
the rocky Sierra Madre range with its canyons
and valleys, where, unless all his leads have been
false clues, those whom they sought would have
their secret den and stronghold.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk got to thinking these matters over, and of
course he was bound to run across some things
that still seemed a bit hazy in his mind. Accordingly
he sought for information at headquarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, now, d’ye know I’m jest beginnin’ to get
on to why you had the wings an’ fuselage o’ this
here ship painted the color o’ sand—took a pattern
from the way they striped the steamers on
the Atlantic durin’ the big war, an’ colored batteries
on the battle front, so flyers couldn’t pick
’em out to drop their bombs down on—camouflage,
ain’t that the right word, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Slow to get on to my little schemes, partner;
but in the end you make a smart stab—yes, that
was what I had in mind, for I knew we’d have
to park the old bus somewhere in the open; and
I didn’t want any hostile eye to glimpse her from
a soaring plane, or a mountain crag—for you see
I reckoned Slim was too smart a lad not to have
binoculars handy so as to watch for trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>More than ever was Perk impressed with an
overwhelming admiration for the ability of his
pal to lay plans capable of covering every possible
necessity that could arise in carrying out
the job they had tackled.</p>

<p class='c013'>He asked no more questions, confident that
everything was bound to move along smoothly,
when the casting of the play was in such capable
hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Anyway,” he told himself as he thus pondered,
“we ain’t seen anything more o’ that moon
ship, which makes it certain we’ve knocked her
outen the runnin’. Wonder now if that was really
an’ truly ol’ Slim, totin’ a swell bunch o’ machine
guns, so’s to bolster up the new revolution
they say is bein’ fostered an’ nursed in this corner
o’ poor ol’ Mexico. Queer what international
jingles a feller c’n get mixed up in, when he runs
in harness with Uncle Sam’s revenue boys; but
it’s all pie to me, just the same, ’cause they allers
did say my middle name was Scrap.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was now starting to make use of the binoculars,
which were fitted with lens capable of
making them useful during the night-time, at
least when there was a certain amount of moonlight.
In a general way Perk could decide where
to turn his attention, for it went without saying
that the mountain chain lay toward the southeast
for had he not studied the lay of the land
upon the small but accurate map with which
Jack had armed himself before leaving Washington
to take up this hazardous adventure?</p>

<p class='c013'>When he felt assured that he could make out
the distant ridges he announced his pleasing discovery
to his mate and then at the other’s request
took over the controls so that Jack in turn might
use the glasses and thus make assurance doubly
safe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bank, and head more into the east,” Perk
heard the other saying, after a steady look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it’s the Sierra Madre okay, partner, I
opine?” suggested the one at the stick, as he
obeyed orders.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question about it,” Jack assured him “but
I knew it was time for us to sight the ridge. I’ve
pored over the map of this section, and charted
it all out in blocks, so I can tell just what the lay
of the land is, and how long it’s apt to take the
colonel to get here with his galloping company.
We’re going to drop down presently, and find
shelter where we can lie low until the hour comes
for making our ten strike.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How long might that be, boss?” asked Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It all depends on certain happenings. We
can creep up close to the place, and watch how
things move figuring out how to act when you
get your first glimpse of a dust cloud away off
toward where Hermosilla lies. I give the cavalry
two days to reach here, if everything moves along
smoothly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Two long days—an’ say, we gotter eat all that
time, don’t we, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We surely can’t live on air, Perk; but I’ve
provided for that—even should we run out of
grub you laid in I’ve a little deposit of dried
meat, real pemmican in fact, that will keep us
from famishing. Water we can secure somewhere
among the mountain trails, since never a
drop would we be apt to find on the open desert.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! I’m leavin’ it all to you, Big Boss,”
Perk told him, again lost in wonder and near
awe as he realized how Jack seemed to have
thought of everything—what a mind the boy had
for grasping details, and weaving them into the
net with which they expected to enmesh the slippery
one.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now Jack slowed down their speed more or
less, although of course it was not possible to
soften the clamor accompanying their flight
through space. But Perk noticed that, so far as
he could tell, the night wind was coming from
ahead, and this assured him it would not be apt
to carry those telltale sounds toward the range
lying in the east, and so warn the enemy of their
coming.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch28' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVIII <br /> <br />CLOSE TO THE TIGER’S LAIR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“We’re about due for a landing, Perk,” finally
announced the pilot, after he had used the glasses
for a spell, and again took over the stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! some hike that’s agoin’ to be, I’d say,
old hoss,” grunted Perk; “but I guess it can’t
be helped—got to take the bitter with the sweet
lots o’ times—the way o’ the world, seems like.
Go to it then, boss; if anybody c’n make a safe
landin’ by moonlight it’s jest you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>His confidence was not misplaced, as Jack
proved when he brought the ship down in as
perfect a three-point drop as the best of aces
could have carried out.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’ll have to lie here till we need her again,”
he observed, on climbing out of his confined
quarters, and stretching his cramped legs after
the manner of air mail pilots in from a long and
irksome run.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk stared around him—they were on the
sandy desert without a doubt, and off toward the
east could be seen the dim crests of the high and
ragged peaks comprising the main ridges of the
Sierra Madres—old-time home of the fierce
Yaqui Indians, whom the soldiers of Mexico had
for so many years labored so hard and in vain
to conquer; nor was it until the day the airplane
came along that they were able to accomplish
this much to be desired end.</p>

<p class='c013'>But now other equally annoying thorns in the
flesh had made a hideout of those same
inaccessible mountains—defeated aspirants for
the presidency of the Republic, always generals,
took to gathering groups of malcontents and mercenary
adventurers in these mountain depths,
defying the troops sent to rout them out, and
proving the latest source of trouble in the political
problems of the authorities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack soon completed his preparations for
abandoning their ship. He looked it all over, to
satisfy himself its camouflage would prevent it
from being sighted by any air pilot chancing to
pass overhead at a reasonable altitude then he
gathered a few articles, the possession of which
might turn out to be of value when it came to
closing the mouth of the bag and finally announced
himself as ready to make a move.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got all you wanted, Perk?” he inquired, incidentally,
for he had reason to feel certain such
was the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! from the binoculars an’ my rifle, down
to what’s left o’ the eats,” the other assured him.
“Guess we’ll get along somehow or other.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! don’t bother your head about the grub
part, comrade; I’m carrying a small packet with
me that holds enough to keep two men alive for
a whole week—all we’ll have to do is to run
across some sort of spring, where we can get all
the drinking water we’ll need, while we wait for
the wagon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! in this case you’re meanin’ a <i>hearse</i>,
’cause mebbe we’ll have to shoot him up afore he
calls quits,” and Perk grinned horribly at his
own wit.</p>

<p class='c013'>So they left the ship stranded there, sprawled
out like a gigantic dragon-fly or a monstrous
toad. If Fortune proved kind they might yet
live to make good use of it again when the time
came to fly back to God’s country on the other
side of the border where defeated candidates
are in the habit of accepting the dictum of the
voters, and retiring from the field of battle await
the next call to arms, with ballots instead of
bullets as their method of settling elections.</p>

<p class='c013'>Side by side they set forth, like a pair of adventurers
starting out in search of Fortune’s
smiles, and careless alike as to whether they met
with success or not, so long as the excitement
they craved came their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk managed to conceal the chagrin with
which he buckled down to his unwelcome task,
walking always gave him a pain, mental rather
than physical but on the whole he was a good
scout, and could follow the beckoning finger of
duty, even though he loathed the conditions attached
to the performance of his role.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sand was far from compact, and allowed
them to sink in somewhat, so this made the going
more difficult in contrast to that on the seashore
which being beaten down by incoming waves is
often as hard as concrete and a pleasure to walk
over; whereas this of the desert was dry and
sifted at the least puff of wind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk having had some previous experience
with deserts, felt no love for the uninviting waste
places of the earth only such useless vegetation
as sage, greasewood, cactus and yucca would
grow between the sand dunes amidst the blistering
fangs of the infernal heat and always vowed
he disliked such arid regions with a violence too
deep for mere words.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet he kept his own counsel and plodded away
alongside his pal as if he had no personal feelings
in the matter whatsoever. Far off in front
of them they could see the line of peaks studded
against the sky once or twice Perk felt certain
he had caught a fluttering light aloft such as
might spring from a passing plane but in every
instance he finally decided it must be some shooting
star, ducking behind the mountain range,
leaving a trailing wake behind that but reflected
its passing glory.</p>

<p class='c013'>One hour, two, and then a third dragged along
before Jack thought fit to call a halt. Never did
poor weary footsore Perk, almost used up, listen
to more welcome and delightful words than
when Jack as he drew to a halt went on to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Time to rest, partner, you know—I’d like to
find a bunch of shady trees that would afford us
a decent shelter from the blazing sun, should we
be so unfortunate as to get adrift after leaving
all landmarks behind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! bless you for sayin’ that, buddy,” Perk
was saying hoarsely, for his throat seemed as dry
as tinder, the fine sand even affecting his vocal
cords so that he would not have recognized his
own voice. “By your leave I guess I’ll lie down
and get the kinks outen my legs. Wow! that
must abeen fi’ miles if she was one—my shoes
are full o’ sand, an’ altogether I don’t feel half
the man I was on startin’ out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There are some trees over yonder, you may
notice, Perk; so after we’ve caught our second
wind we’ll take chances, and cut across to where
they lie, perhaps when morning comes tripping
along, we may climb up the face of the mountain
and get a look-in at the printing establishment
that’s set itself up in opposition to the U. S.
Treasury Department, and the Federal Bank.
Come on then, a little further where we can drop
down, and rest our weary feet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards the pair had crept in
among the sheltering trees, where Jack called a
rest, although under the impression that they
should get along further before break of day.</p>

<p class='c013'>He talked matters over with his partner, speaking
almost in whispers, since in this enemy country
no one could take anything for granted and
for all they knew hostile ears might chance to
be close by, ready to listen in.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Perk himself who proposed to move
along while the going was good.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like we might be a heap better off, old
hoss, if on’y we located up thar on the side o’ the
mountain, where we could see without our bein’
watched. I’m okay now, an’ ready for b’ar.”</p>

<p class='c013'>That was the spirit Jack liked in his mate—a
readiness to take hold and reach a decision. They
moved along toward the base of the forbidding
height, keeping a watchful eye on the eastern
sky lest dawn come and surprise them in the
open, where it would not be easy to find a hiding
place during the entire day.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fortune favored them, for they managed to
get under cover before the first gray streaks appeared
in the east. It was bound to be a strenuous
task climbing that formidable mountain side
but Jack had prepared for even this part of the
adventure.</p>

<p class='c013'>From various sources he had learned how there
were three separate means for subduing that
grim pyramid of rocks and trees and tangled
growth—in order to lessen the chances of discovery,
with unpleasant consequences, Jack had
decided to try and negotiate the most difficult
of these mountain trails in the belief that it
would offer a safer passage since evidently none
of the seething revolutionists, or their allies, the
bad men from across the border, would be likely
to follow that canyon trail when others less difficult
could be utilized.</p>

<p class='c013'>Down there hidden by the bushes and spurs
of outlying rock they employed their time in
munching what must serve as their breakfast.
Then quenching their thirst at a convenient
pool they proceeded to climb the face of
the steep elevation, making for the quaint hollow
in the crater of a long dead volcano and which
had once been a Yaqui fort.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch29' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIX <br /> <br />NEARING THE GOAL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>They had now reached that most thrilling
point in their bold venture, where they would
have to “watch their steps” most carefully, lest
an incautious act precipitate a calamity that must
end all their hopes as well as snuff out their
lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>This breeding place for inflammatory embers
of Mexican revolutionary disappointed political
generals, and their immediate retainers, was
about as safe for the two sky detectives as a cage
of Bengal tigers would have been once let their
presence be suspected, and the entire neighborhood
would be scratched over as with a fine-tooth
comb in the endeavor to discover their
hiding place and should they be rounded up it
needed no magician to prophesy what their fate
must be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack led the way, with Perk following at his
heels, every sense on the alert. The native cougar
of that historical group of mountains could
hardly have crept along with greater care than
did the two human sleuth hounds of the law.
Every advance was attempted only after a careful
survey of the entire neighborhood—at the
sound of some faint bird-call Jack would sink
down and flatten himself upon the ground, his
example being imitated by his shadow.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this caused their progress to be exceedingly
slow but time did not enter into their calculations
so much as security—many hours must
pass ere Jack could figure on the arrival of those
upon whom everything depended and they
might as well make use of the entire morning in
climbing higher and higher toward their ultimate
goal.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once when they chanced to be resting their
tired limbs, snug in a sheltered nook behind a
mass of brushwood, Jack turned and looked back.
The site was especially fine for looking out on
the level stretch toward the spot where they had
landed during the preceding night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, watching the actions of his comrade,
could easily give a close guess as to what Jack
had in mind. This opinion was made more convincing
when he saw the other get out the useful
binoculars, and apply them to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Keenly he kept tabs on the others and was
finally thrilled to note the pleased nod Jack gave
as if wholly satisfied.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk touched him on the arm, and as Jack
turned made motions with his head, while his
eyebrows went up, his expression without a single
word being spoken signifying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How come?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take a look for yourself, and tell me if you
can get the first glimpse of our old crate” suggested
Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ doin,” whispered Perk, after a most
diligent search; “an’ if we can’t get a whiff o’
the boat, with these glasses, I kinder guess
nobody ain’t agoin’ to locate it with their naked
eyes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which same lets us out from any danger in
that quarter,” came softly from Jack, whose face
for the moment lost some of the strained look it
had borne during the last few hours.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never saw a better sample o’ camouflage
when I was across the big pond alistenin’ to the
smash o’ the rip-roarin’ German guns,” asserted
Perk; and then “dried up” when he saw the
other press a finger on his lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>Higher they climbed, like monkeys, taking all
manner of desperate chances when necessity
arose but so cautious was Jack in leading the
way that nothing amiss came about, every obstacle
being successfully surmounted until
shortly before the noon hour they found themselves
in a position to spy upon the camp of their
intended prey.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was intensely interested in what he now
visioned. The old crater, resembling an immense
football bowl, as adopted by some Eastern
colleges, looked as though it might have proven
well nigh impregnable as a fortress where the
fighting Yaquis were able to hold an army at
bay—which feat history records as an actual fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>Scattered about the depression were scores of
rude dwellings, some built of rocks, while others
more modern had walls composed of sun-baked
bricks, known throughout all Mexico as <i>adobes</i>.
Men and women, also children, could be seen
moving about, preparing the noonday meal or
partaking of their customary frijoles, hot tamales,
or it might be maize cakes cooked in the
hot ashes of fires, and with black coffee as a
beverage.</p>

<p class='c013'>The picture appealed to Perk, who delighted
in novel scenes nor did it seem to lose any of
its thrill from the fact that, as he very well knew,
the men he was staring at so eagerly were most
likely as tough a brand of desperadoes and villains
as could be grouped together anywhere on
earth—ready to fight, hold up trains, or commit
all manner of pillage at the drop of a hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>He marveled at the sagacity shown by Slippery
Slim in deciding to join forces with these
firebrands of the back country, with the idea of
thus securing the greatest safety for his own
lawless operations.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this while Jack had been keeping close
watch, in hopes of being able to pick out the
figure of the man he had been deputized to bring
back to the States so he might be prosecuted for
his crimes, and sent to Atlanta. There he would
possibly end his days in seclusion, with a large
portion of the Southwest breathing more freely
since they need no longer fear the avalanche of
counterfeit currency that had been demoralizing
business for such a long spell.</p>

<p class='c013'>After all it was Perk who made the discovery,
he chancing to be carefully handling the binoculars
at the time. He handed the glasses over to
his mate, and told Jack just where to look, using
as few words as possible, and keeping his voice
very low.</p>

<p class='c013'>Long and earnestly did Jack follow the movements
of the remarkable character who had been
described in his hearing so many times. What
satisfaction it afforded him to know he was actually
in sight of the big game and if only his
plans carried through his hour of triumph was
steadily drawing closer and closer. In imagination,
as he continued to watch the moving figure,
he could vision the pleasure it would afford him
when he could turn in his report to his Chief,
and mark it as completed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon drifted along, and night approached.
Nothing could be done to hasten the
crisis; they must wait patiently, and continue to
shape their plans until the expected smoke signal
told them Morales and his rough riders had
reached the foot of the Sierra Madres ten miles
further south and when assured by means of a
counter signal that everything was working well,
start to cover the last lap of their long ride, leave
their mounts at a safe distance, and complete the
journey on foot.</p>

<p class='c013'>When darkness fell the picture was even more
fascinating to Perk than before, with a number
of fires lighting up the huge bowl, the sound of
women chattering in Spanish, and children playing
just as all youngsters might do while from
time to time he could catch strains of music, telling
that some amorous swain might be practicing
on his guitar, as all who have a drop of Spanish
blood in their veins invariably love to do when
at leisure.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk doubtless made many a grimace while
partaking of the light refreshment afforded by
the tough pemmican Jack had produced, as their
sole means for staying their empty stomachs for
when the evening breeze wafted some of the
odors from the cooking fires down below it almost
set him wild with a desire to partake of hot
food. But he knew what he was up against, and
sternly repressed the inclination to groan his
protest.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was one of the longest nights Perk ever
knew. The mountain air, too, was cold, especially
along toward the last few hours and since
they were debarred from the joy of indulging
in a campfire, Perk could only lie there and
shiver. He never was so glad to see the pink
sky in the east as on that occasion.</p>

<p class='c013'>The day was but a repetition of their former
afternoon with their sole recreation being the
chance it gave them to watch Slippery Slim’s
movements whenever he appeared coming out of
what seemed to be a cavern of some sort from
which at several times when the racket from many
tongues died down Perk could catch a strange
rumbling sound, accompanied by what seemed
to be a blow, and which he could easily believe
must be the working of the printing press that
had been carried all the way from the States in
order to be able to produce those wonderfully
clever notes that had deceived many shrewd
bank tellers by their deceptive qualities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then at last Jack discovered, just as night had
begun to fall, three columns of smoke rising toward
the heavens from far down the wild Sierra,
telling how that Morales and his troop had arrived,
and that the curtain was about to rise on
the last scene of the international drama.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch30' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXX <br /> <br />JACK GETS HIS MAN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Immediately on discovering the welcome signal,
Jack dispatched Perk to put a match to the
heap of brush they had arranged well out of sight
from the depression where the skeleton revolutionary
army was slowly assembling its pitiful
force of the dissatisfied generals who had been
counted out in the last national election.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk understood what was expected of him,
and managed to send up a single smoke signal,
allowing it to have but a brief life and then hastening
to smother the fire. As Morales was expected
to be on the watch for just such a sign,
he would lose little time in starting to carry out
his part in the attack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In three hours they will be climbing the
mountain by way of the old Yaqui trail we followed,”
Jack was telling his chum, when the
other returned to his side, flushed with the success
of his labors. “It is time for us to make a
forward move, so that we may be ready to strike
as soon as the camp quiets down and corral our
man, leaving it to Morales to carry the fort itself
by storm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This they set about doing without any further
delay. Dodging from rock to rock, taking advantage
of every outlying spur, as well as patches
of hardy bushes, and other objects that were
likely to conceal their movements from any
watchful eyes but always creeping downward,
they crawled along like two great lizards such,
as Perk could remember seeing when in the
Philippines.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the time they were ready to slip into the
underground pressroom of the lawless printing
company’s plant, Jack figured the three hours
had just about expired, and that it was now up to
them to make the first hostile move that would
precipitate the assault.</p>

<p class='c013'>In thus deciding to make a start he was influenced
by seeing an agreed upon signal from
the same hiding place he and Perk had held for
so many hours, and which told him the troopers
had finally succeeded in climbing to the position
assigned to them when plans for action were
formed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Flattening themselves out against the dark
wall of a small cliff Jack and Perk glided along
until they arrived at that aperture in the solid
rock they knew to be the entrance to the wonderful
underground retreat that had been described
by Simeon at the time when in his desperation
he gave his confederates away and from which
they had watched Slippery Slim come and go
during those long hours of their espionage.</p>

<p class='c013'>Slipping inside, they found themselves in a
corridor that led into the body of the mountain
with a gleam of light beckoning them to advance.
In this fashion they kept moving, gliding from
one point to another, until eventually they had a
clear view of the little machine that was working
so industriously in turning out the bogus
money, hour after hour, as though the demand
were without limit.</p>

<p class='c013'>How Perk did stare, and hold his breath when
realizing that they were upon the verge of accomplishing
their great undertaking. Slippery
Slim was doing no actual manual labor himself,
but he kept close watch over the two men who
ran the press, closely scrutinizing the printed
bills as if to detect the slightest inaccuracy, and
correct it without delay.</p>

<p class='c013'>No wonder, Jack told himself, the product of
his skill had startled the financial world by its
genuine appearance, when such a master in his
particular line took such personal pains to see
that the work was carried out in its most minute
details.</p>

<p class='c013'>In whispers Jack informed his backer what his
duty would be when the roar of guns and hoarse
shouts from without announced that the picked
troopers had actually launched their long deferred
assault. Jack had taken it upon himself
to close in on the chief worker in that little
coterie, and have the glory of capturing Slippery
Slim unaided but meanwhile Perk might find
plenty of action in holding up those two others
who were second in importance only to the leading
figure.</p>

<p class='c013'>The tension had become almost unendurable
when suddenly there broke out a frightful uproar—women
were shrieking, children’s high
pitched voices told of intense alarm; men gave
tongue, and above it all guns began to sound with
deadly import, until the basin rocked with the
dreadful clamor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack waited no longer, but giving Perk a kick
on the shins to tell him to get busy he rushed
headlong toward Slippery Slim, holding his automatic
ready for instant service, knowing as he
did that such a desperate bad man as Slim
was reckoned from all accounts, would not be
apt to surrender so long as there remained the
slightest chance for a getaway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nor was he mistaken in judging the character
of the man who had so long defied the shrewdest
detectives of the United States Secret Service
for when Slim found his way to the open air
barred by such a determined looking figure, he
snatched out his handy gat and made as if to open
fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>For once he was just a trifle too slow with his
service gun, for Jack, clever lad that he was
along the line of firing off-hand, managed to send
a bullet through Slim’s right shoulder that crippled
him, so that his own weapon went rattling
to the stone under his feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put ’em up!” Jack was saying, covering his
man as he spoke and having no desire to commit
suicide, Slippery Slim obeyed the call; and
instantly afterwards suffering the painful ignominy
of having his wrists encircled by a pair
of nice new steel bracelets.</p>

<p class='c013'>So far so good, with Jack, his own share of the
capture an accomplished fact, able to turn in
order to lend Perk a helping hand. It was not
needed, for Perk had descended on those two
muscular chaps like a thunderbolt, knocking one
down with a terrific jolt under the chin and
causing the other to look along the short barrel
of his blued automatic, he having discarded the
repeating rifle for the time being in favor of
the easier handled pocket gun.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the trio of discomfited rogues were all
handcuffed, Jack and his reliable partner turned
and faced the other way, so as to be ready for a
rush, should some of those valorous generals
decide to take advantage of the defensive security
of the rock cave, and bolt into its gaping mouth.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being actually attempted they met with
a demoralizing surprise when they found themselves
the objects of a hot fire, that brought about
a complete right-about face movement and
presently forced their ignominious surrender to
the gallant Colonel Morales and his fierce fighters,
who had once before gone through an interesting
campaign in that same old extinct volcano
vent, with warlike redskins as their opponents.</p>

<p class='c013'>The end was not long in coming, with many
of the would-be revolutionists holding up their
hands in complete surrender others escaping
by losing themselves along the scraggly sides of
the mountains and not a few either slain outright,
or seriously wounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and his chum had a chance to meet the
doughty Colonel Morales, pride of the Mexican
army, and be congratulated on their clever work
of rounding up such a jack-o’-lantern, fly-by-night
as Slim Garrabrant. Of course the two
comrades were eager to start back to the other
side of the border, since complications might
come up over their legal warrant to arrest a criminal
so badly wanted by the Washington authorities,
but who had made his headquarters south
of the international line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly they handed over Slim’s two lieutenants,
who would have to answer to a charge
of being hand-in-glove with those plotting generals,
and doubtless find themselves incarcerated
in a Mexican dungeon for some years, a fate that
made Perk shudder to contemplate.</p>

<p class='c013'>While he stood guard over their prisoner, Jack
sent Perk off at dawn, mounted on one of the
cavalry horses, and accompanied by a soldier
who would fetch back both animals, Perk’s duty
being to get the stranded ship off the ground,
and drop down at a more convenient spot closer
to the former mountain stronghold of the tiger-like
Yaquis.</p>

<p class='c013'>By nightfall they were hundreds of miles on
their way over Arizona and New Mexico, Jack
having decided to carry his prisoner, whose
wound did not prove to be very serious, though
painful enough—all the way to Washington, and
present him to his superior, with his customary
air of not realizing that he had done anything
extraordinary.</p>

<p class='c013'>That this thrilling feat was only a common
occurrence in the lives of such intrepid manhunters
as serve the Government through the
agency of the Secret Service and that from time
to time Jack and Perk might with reason be
expected to duplicate such adventurous feats can
be set down as certain; indeed, the title of the
next number in the Sky Detective Series, “<i>Eagles
of the Sky; or With Jack Ralston Along the Air
Lanes</i>,” a tale of the smugglers of the Florida
Coast, will grip the reader from start to finish,
and prove to be one of the most thrilling stories
ever written for lovers of action and valor.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent
permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.

For additional contact information:
     Dr. Gregory B. Newby
     Chief Executive and Director
     gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

  <h1 class='c010'><span class='xlarge'>THE SKY DETECTIVES</span></h1>
</div>

<div>
  <h2 id='ch01' class='c011'>CHAPTER I <br /> <br />READY FOR THE TAKE-OFF</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>It was a day in the late Fall when Jack
Ralston, accompanied by his best pal, Gabe
Perkiser, known simply as “Perk” by all his
friends, found themselves climbing out of a
hired taxi that had halted on the border of
Candler Flying Field just a short distance out
of Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! reg’lar mob out here today, seems
like,” observed Perk, as he took note of the
triple line of cars parked around the field, with
its numerous up-to-date hangars, and with ships
coming and going every few minutes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, you see Perk, it happens to be a big day
at stunt flying, with fat prizes for the winners.
All the better for us, I’d say, since our take-off
will hardly make a ripple in the pond, with all
this confusion going on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing, my boy,” continued Perk, with
one of his humorous grins that betokened a good-natured
chap; “and privacy’s just what we crave.
I guess now that might be the mail comin’ from
down East an’ New York?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A rotten guess then, Perk,” chortled the
other; “Eastern mail boat was due here at six-ten
this morning; the Pitcairn Aviation concern
handle that route, as well as the run between
Atlanta and Miami down in Florida; and I’m
telling you for a fact the boys holding the stick
with <i>that</i> corporation are nearly always on time
to the dot, come storm, come fog as thick as
pea-soup. The schedule I glimpsed at the Atlanta
post office gave the time of the East Coast
ship as seven-thirty P. M.; that from New Orleans
at six-thirty P. M.; and the one from
Chicago about the same time. So you see it
couldn’t be a mail crate dropping down right
now, unless they’d had to make a forced landing,
and lost time in making repairs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, come to think of it I sure did hear a
bus passin’ over just at peep o’ day,” admitted
Perk. “Let’s have a look-in while we’re here,
and see what a bag o’ tricks these stunt flyers
are holdin’ up their sleeves, so’s to give this
crowd a row o’ thrills.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suits me, Perk; no great hurry about our
jumping off, so long as we pull the gun before
dark sets in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! little difference it makes on a patch
as well lighted as this Candler Field o’ your
home city, old boy; and with a flashlight beacon
set every ten miles all the way down to Orleans,
to keep us on our course. Look at that guy
fairly burning the air like hot cakes—he must
be tryin’ to beat the speed record, I guess, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hardly a day comes without some record
going by the board,” remarked Jack, who had
a reputation as a safe and sane pilot, although
on occasion he had been known to put through
some tricks so death-defying as to make the
hearts of the spectators seem to jump up in
their throats with the thrill.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was quite correct when he stated that
Atlanta was the home city of his close friend
and chum; although Jack’s family had moved
away years back, and become fruit raisers in
far-off California. Still, having spent some
years in the Georgia capital Jack always liked
to drop in and renew a limited number of old
friendships when opportunity offered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack Ralston had begun his aviation work
starting at the lowest round, that of a Gypsy
pilot, flying an ancient boat at County Fairs and
Harvest Home gatherings; doing aerial stunts,
and “bailing out” by means of a parachute while
another pilot ran the ship; also taking up air
minded “sand-bags” as passengers at so much
each person.</p>

<p class='c013'>From this modest beginning he had finally
accepted a position with an aircraft corporation
having contracts with the Post Office Department
at Washington for carrying the mails, and
later on express matter as well; and last of all
working for Uncle Sam through joining the
Secret Service corps of skillful detectives, whose
activities covered every part of the Nation, and
even to adjacent countries as well.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the Government wearied of the bold
doings of one “Slippery Slim” Garrabrant, and
decided to “clip the wings” of that audacious
freebooter and bogus-money crook, it was only
natural they should pick Jack for this service.
The reasons for doing so were many, but what
counted most was Jack’s well known cleverness
as an all-round air pilot; for it happened that
the slick rogue who had been giving the revenue
men such a wild-goose chase, with his thumb
held up to his nose, so to speak, was himself a
remarkable master of the air lanes, he having
been an ace as a flying pilot over with the army
on the Argonne front in France.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since as a rule this troublesome offender carried
on his bold enterprises by means of a handy
plane—frequently with a single assistant, who
helped handle both ship and cargo—the man
thus selected to put a crimp in his activities was
likewise given full permission to engage a helper
from the same arm of the Government forces,
one who must of course know something about
the handling of a plane, so that in case of necessity
he could serve as co-pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack lost no time in picking Gabe Perkiser,
otherwise known simply as “Perk”—a man who
had supped with adventure since he was “knee
high to a duck”—a half Yankee—half Canuck,
drifting into the army, and serving with the
sausage observation balloon corps over in
France; from which patriotic occupation he
later on became a champion light-weight boxer.
Leaving the ring while as yet undefeated he
served for several years with the Canadian
Mounted Police. Here his smartness in usually
fetching back his man, no matter what the difficulties
that had to be surmounted, attracted
the attention of a gentleman connected with
Uncle Sam’s Secret Service, just then moose
hunting over the northern border, who finally
influenced Perk to join up with his force.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and the other had met under peculiar
conditions when both were tracking a bunch of
check raisers floating across the country and
leaving a wide swath of victims in their path.
They had become more than friends, although
meeting but seldom; then, when the opportunity
came for Jack to call upon Perk to join him in
the new job that had been turned over to his
charge, the latter had responded with alacrity.</p>

<p class='c013'>So here they were, on the threshold of an
affair that promised to engage their united talents
in running down the leader of the most
troublesome gang of counterfeit currency makers
known to the Government agents in the last
ten years.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every clue possessed at Headquarters had
been turned over to Jack at the time he was
given authority to carry on as the situation demanded;
although this information was a bit
limited, and much was left to the shrewdness
of the two trail hounds themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no hurry at all, and Jack had
always been one of those cautious workers who
meant to provide for all sorts of emergencies.
Only too well did he know how many a splendid
undertaking went on the rocks from lack of
foreseeing the next move on the part of the
astute criminals whose apprehension meant so
much to the Government, as well as the folks
they were victimizing.</p>

<p class='c013'>But by now he had decided everything was
arranged so far as human means would permit,
and that it was high time they started on their
long chase. Their boat, a Stinson Detroiter, a
monoplane with a Wright Whirlwind motor,
and reckoned to be an unusually swift craft, was
already loaded, and ready for immediate departure.
It had been stored in one of the big
hangars connected with the Candler Flying
Field but could be taxied into position when
Jack felt ready to skip off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their flying togs were also contained in a
locker in the same hangar, and could be donned
in a jiffy, even to the ’chute harness that was
so familiar to Jack, and a constant reminder of
early experiences when he was accustomed to
carry out his daily program of “quitting the
ship” with as much <i>sang froid</i> as though the
jump into space from a five thousand foot ceiling
were absolutely next to nothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>But plainly Perk was becoming a bit restless,
as though eager to be on his way; which fact
doubtless influenced Jack to eventually give the
word that took them to their hangar. Here
they commenced preparing for a night flight
that was expected to land them in New Orleans,
where Jack was to interview a certain representative
of the Government service, from whom
he anticipated receiving a few valuable tips that
would give them something tangible and serve
as a beginning of their arduous chase.</p>

<p class='c013'>While they were thus engaged someone
hailed them with a boisterous greeting, at which
Perk grinned, and made a suitable reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hey, Scotty, this your night off, is it—got
in from your route okay, and stepped out to see
the boys cut a few figger-eights in the sky—just
can’t keep away from the game, even when you
got a lay-off? What’s new, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They told me at the house you expected to
step off tonight, boys—is that a fact, or did they
slip an easy one over me, I want to know?” demanded
the other, who was apparently a mail
pilot friend of theirs—in fact, having the adjoining
room at the small hotel where they were
stopping.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” Jack told him, secretive as usual,
“we’re going further, and boosting the Stinson
Detroiter ship by showing what it has to set it
above most other boats. Plans not fully arranged
as yet, but we’re on our way; so it’s good-bye,
and good luck to you, Scotty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about that news, Scotty?” the insistent
Perk went on to demand, being by nature one of
those stubborn chaps who can never be happy
until they get what they are after, no matter
how trivial it may seem.</p>

<p class='c013'>The air mail pilot scratched his head, and
then with a grin answered Perk’s question.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much along the line of aviation;
but something queer happened to me—say, did
you boys sleep at home last night while I was
on the road?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We sure did,” Perk told him, and then
added: “What makes you ask that, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Didn’t hear any sort of racket in my den
did you, fellows?” continued the other; at which
Perk, after exchanging a look of bewilderment
with his pal, hastened to answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a thing, Scotty; but then you know I
sleep like a log; and it’d have to be a thunderclap
to wake me up; what’s been going on?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You got me guessing, Perk,” said the other,
with a look of disgust; “only when I got in this
morning I found my room looking like a hurricane
had struck it, my things tossed out of drawers,
my trunk broken open, and say, you never
saw such a dirty mess. Course I asked the boss
what it meant; but he was as much surprised
as I was—talked with every servant from the
cook down to Mary the chamber maid; but
nobody could tell a darned thing about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again Jack and Perk exchanged a swift
glance, as though the same idea had struck both
of them. Scotty did not appear to notice this,
being too worked up with the mystery that had
so suddenly gripped his fortunes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did you lose anything worth while, Scotty?”
Jack asked, in a voice that suggested sympathy;
but to his surprise the other shook his head in
the negative, and even grinned as he lifted his
heavy eyebrows to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s the funny part of it, boys; whoever
the sneak thief was, he didn’t even dent me a
little bit—so far as I c’n see not a blessed thing
is missing—fact is, I’m even better off than before
he paid that queer visit, ’cause he left this
old pocketbook mixed up with my traps; and
it ain’t mine for a fact, though I’m meaning to
spend the little wad of dough it holds. Like
manna coming down to the children of Israel
in the Wilderness, wouldn’t you say, boys?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lucky old hoss you are, Scotty,” remarked
Perk, enviously; while Jack nodded his head as
though to echo the sentiment.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c014'>CHAPTER II <br /> <br />THE LUCK OF SCOTTY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Happen to have that pocketbook along with
you, Scotty?” asked Jack, in a matter of fact
tone; just as though he might be possessed of
ordinary curiosity concerning so amazing a
visit; since never before had he heard of a night
prowler leaving his own money behind him,
when his intention had been to rob his victim.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing, Jack,” promptly replied the air
mail pilot; “here, take a squint at my Christmas
present, dropped in by old Santa Claus
a bit before the reg’lar holiday season,” and with
a laugh he chucked the object in question into
the hand of the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Old, just as you remarked, Scotty,” observed
Jack, “and used a long time. It must have
slipped out of his pocket when he worked your
stuff over to mix it up like the devil.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Open it up and see what the blessed chump
left me in place of his card,” the other continued,
looking exceedingly proud over his lucky
find.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did that with alacrity; in fact it
was what he intended doing, for reasons of his
own; something more than curiosity influencing
him, it would appear.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gee whiz! a neat little bunch of the needful,
I’d say, Scotty, old hoss!” burst out the envious
Perk, his eyes fixed full upon the contents of
the much worn pocketbook, which Jack was
holding in his hand and apparently interested
in counting, for there were a number of bank
notes for various amounts, and among them just
three five-dollar bills, seemingly quite fresh,
though a bit soiled, as though they had been in
circulation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nineteen smackers in all,” announced Perk,
showing that he had also been keeping tabs on
the count. “Well, wouldn’t that knock you cold
though? Huh? that same caller must’ve been
looking for <i>me</i>, and just missed connections by
striking the next door. Well, here’s wishing you
the same old luck every time a sneak thief pays
you a visit, Scotty boy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack on his part was feeling of the three five-dollar
bills, and holding them up to the light
from the western sun that managed to come
into the hangar by way of the open doors.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What ails you, Jack?” demanded the recipient
of Fortune’s smiles, as he noticed these
strange actions on the part of his new friend.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much,” he was told, “only I’m going
to give you a bit of advice, partner, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to it, boy; always willing to take it
when it seems sound!” snapped the mail carrier,
briskly enough, still more than curious.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you’re wise, Scotty,” went on Jack, smilingly,
“you’ll not try to pass any one of these
five-dollar bills until you’ve asked the opinion
of some bank teller—it might get you into
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Zowie! what’s that you’re saying, Jack—don’t
tell me they’re off-color bills, counterfeits
in fact. Wouldn’t that be a rotten deal to hand
out, and me figgering how I’d spend them? Is
<i>that</i> what you mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon it’s so, Scotty, much as I hate to
knock your good luck,” Jack told him, with a
shake of his head. “I happened to have a little
experience in a small bank some years ago and
they did say I showed signs of being a clever
detector of bad money. That’s a clever job all
right; but I’m afraid it won’t stand the wash
worth a cent. Go slow, and don’t count your
chickens before they’re hatched. Also I’d advise
you not to go around telling about your windfall
until you’ve shown this stuff to some friendly
bank official, whose advice you’d be willing to
take. If he says it’s good stuff why forget what
I’m saying, and go the limit. But we’d better
be finishing our own job, Perk, and get off on
our jump.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Scotty hung around for a short time, looking
puzzled, as though he hardly knew how much
to believe. What Jack had said in his friendly
fashion had doubtless cast quite a damper on
certain bright dreams in which he had been indulging.
However, he finally decided to take
himself off, evidently eager to know whether
the laugh was on him or not, for he called out:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goodbye, Jack, Perk; and be sure to look me
up when next you drop in at Candler Field Airport;
like as not I’ll still be on my old job here,
unless they decide to transfer me somewhere else.
And say, Jack, I’m meaning to take your advice,
and get an opinion on this here stuff ’fore I try
to pass it out on any old duffer. So-long boys
and luck!”</p>

<p class='c013'>When the two comrades, adventure bound,
found themselves alone they looked at each other
in silence for almost a full minute, when a grin
started to travel over Perk’s well bronzed face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, wouldn’t it jar you though, to have such
luck knock at your door, and then give you a sly
kick?” he demanded of his companion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To tell the honest truth, Perk, I’m not thinking
about Scotty and his queer windfall; it’s
our own great good luck that’s making me suspect
we’re bound to carry this job through with
flying colors.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Eh? now what d’ye mean by saying that?”
asked the other hastily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right in the beginning, Perk, we seem to
have stumbled on a nice little plum in the shape
of a clue—flung directly at our heads, you might
say in the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! do you mean to tell me those bogus
notes were off the same plates we’ve been
hearing so much about lately that I’ve been
dreamin’ I was tied hand an’ foot, an’ poked
under a dozen bales of them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just that, as sure as you live, partner,” said
Jack, composedly; but if he could take it so
coolly, not so his right bower who showed signs
of extreme excitement and satisfaction, for he
thrust out his hand, that had so often been an
object of vast respect on the part of some welter
weight boxer, and insisted that Jack accept a
gentle shake.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re sure Fortune’s favorites,” Perk was
saying, striking an attitude as he thus proudly
spoke; “an’ with such luck hoverin’ over our
heads I vow all the Lower Regions with its devils
can’t prevail against us. But see here, old hoss,
there’s more than chance in this break o’ the
party who broke through Scotty’s door, and
panned all his traps—I guess now he must have
missed a cylinder, an’ jest passed us by in a
ground loop.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was accustomed to the other’s quaint way
of expressing himself, for he lost no time in
adding:</p>

<p class='c013'>“About that way, I take it, Perk. And if
what we suspect turns out to be true, it stands to
reason there’s some sort of big combine back of
it all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“With this same Slippery Slim Garrabrant
pulling the wires for the whole bunch, is that
what you mean, Jack?” demanded the other flyer
quickly; for when once set on the right track
Perk’s mind could travel speedily enough.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s certainly his brain that’s built up this
wide flim-flam trade in the make believe green
stuff that’s been fooling a whole lot of bank tellers,
it’s so near the genuine article. To
smash the combine we’ve got to check up on
Slim; after he’s caged the entire arrangement’s
bound to fall through.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, partner; and them’s my sentiments
every time,” admitted the eager Perk. “And
here, when we’re starting out to pull off our
fresh stunt, I’m wishing all the luck that’s going
to our little game. Meaning to give her a last
checking over, eh, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s a habit of mine, as you know, Perk; and
you might amuse yourself stowing the cargo
we’ve taken aboard, so’s to let us have room for
our feet when we take off. From the looks of
the junk you picked up anybody’d reckon we
planned to go into camp for a week or two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, mebbe that’s what’ll happen to us before
we strike pay dirt in this ticklish job,”
asserted Perk, stoutly. “You know we figgered
things out, and made up our minds this same
slick article of a Slim might have his hangout
over the line in Old Mexico, where he prints
his bad bills, and then comes across the line with
a big bunch in his ship, so’s to scatter the stuff
around to his agents in Texas and Arizona, or
it might be all through Southern California. If
that guess turns out to be a bullseye we might
be away off the line of travel for days at a stretch,
and a grub stake’d turn the trick okay, I’m thinking,
boss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack made no reply, for he was already busily
engaged in looking over his crate. This was, as
he had mentioned, an old habit, contracted in
the early days of his career as an aviator of sorts;
and most likely such extreme caution had saved
his life more than once.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he too worked close by, Perk was thinking
more or less about something that had caught
his ever watchful eye just before they entered
the hangar to make these last preparations for
their southern flight. As usual he was unable
to keep his speculations entirely to himself, since
he always liked to compare notes, and find out
whether his companion’s views coincided with
his own.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, Jack, did you happen to notice that
Ryan ship they’d just taken out of the shed before
ours?” he demanded, while still lifting
packages of various supplies, and stowing them
away in a shipshape fashion; so they would not
be likely to shift, and thus imperil the safety
of himself and comrade, should they chance to
encounter rough weather later on.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not particularly,” came the answer. “I was
too busy over my own affairs to bother with anything
that didn’t concern me in the least. What
of it, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much, old hoss, only it was a next
to new bus, and hadn’t been flown more’n a few
thousand air miles, I’d guess. Couple of fellers
seemed to be the crew, one of ’em lookin’ like
he might be a pilot; and the other a chap that
was out to have a jolly good time sportin’ for
sport. I saw him handlin’ some sort of gun,
which made me guess he was down South for
the shootin’ season—mebbe after bear in the
Louisiana canebrakes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack laughed as if amused, for he had noted
the way in which the other made this stab at
what might be the designs of the unknown
parties.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Feel a bit envious I take it, Perk,” he observed,
laconically. “Always did yearn for the
day to come when you’d have a ship of your
own, and could spend all your spare time jumping
about the country, enjoying yourself with
rod and gun. Cheer up, old sport, you may live
to see that day yet, if things break right for us
in a few big games like this one we’re running
down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thanks for your good luck wishes, Jack,” the
other was saying; “I c’n just picture the bully
times that pair’ll like enough have sitting by
their camp-fire, living on game they’ve knocked
over, and not caring a darn whether school
keeps or not. Oh! well, if I live long enough
mebbe I may have a whiff of that kind of life
before I kick off for keeps; they say everything
comes to the man who waits, and that’s me.
There, that finishes my job, with everything
stowed away as slick as you please. When you’re
ready, Jack, we’ll be on our way.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c014'>CHAPTER III <br /> <br />HEADED SOUTH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Apparently Jack had completed his task
about the same time, for he was adjusting his
’chute harness, without which he seldom made a
long distance flight. This was only second nature
to him, because of the long experience he
had had in barnstorming, and doing stunts for
a living in years gone by.</p>

<p class='c013'>This accomplished, he stepped outside the
hangar, and beckoned to a couple of ground
workers who chanced to be close by, possibly
in anticipation of their services being required,
with a tip in prospect.</p>

<p class='c013'>Between them the ship was moved to the open,
and after that it would be a simple thing for
Jack to taxi across the strip of ground adjoining
the big Pitcairn hangar, so as to face such
wind as was stirring.</p>

<p class='c013'>With what Perk had said concerning the new
Ryan monoplane and its crew still fresh in his
mind, Jack did give a brief glance in that quarter.
He could only see that both men were fully
equipped with dungarees, helmets, and even
chutes fastened to their backs; which combination
was an effectual disguise, since their best
friends might have failed to recognize either
of them offhand.</p>

<p class='c013'>The one who was garbed in what seemed to
be fresh clean overalls, and who must be the
employer, seemed to feel a mild interest in their
movements, for he was looking that way through
his goggles, that had been pulled down as if in
preparation for some species of flight. The
other was busying himself adjusting something,
and from his greasy dungarees it was evident
he must be the working pilot of the Ryan craft.</p>

<p class='c013'>With all the bustle that was going on covering
the stunt flying and speed races, Jack did
not bother taking a second look; he failed to
have the same interest in the possible sporting
excursion of the unknown pair that had gripped
Perk and hence failed to let the matter occupy
any more of his limited time.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon both settled down in their respective
places in the double cockpit of the ship,
Jack of course occupying the front seat, since
he had been placed in command, with the other
acting as co-pilot and observer.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a very decent crate taken in all, that
had been secured for their work on this special
occasion, for Uncle Sam is never stingy in supplying
his agents of the Secret Service with
whatever they need, from means for swift travel
to the customary “grub” necessary to their upkeep
when “on the road.” These air detectives
in whom we are particularly interested just now,
as a rule were angling for big fish, and it was
absolutely necessary they should be given a free
hand when making their demands for proper
backing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it’s goodbye to Candler Field for us
right now,” remarked Perk, as he shot a general
look around, being more or less interested in
the exciting events being pulled off in the air
circus. “Playtime’s past, and now we’ve just
got to put in our best licks along the line of
business. Huh! seems like them two guys are
meaning to pull out right on our heels, from the
lively way that greasy lad is jumping around—keeps
an eye on us in the bargain, as if it mattered
a lick whether we did get going before
he was ready to follow suit. Some folks never
do like anybody to show ’em their dust, even
when it don’t matter a pinch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then Jack waved his hand toward the two
hostlers whom he had generously tipped, and
pulled the gun in his accustomed careful fashion;
after which they started along the level
field for the takeoff, there being small necessity
for a runway on such a generous fairway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Faster and faster they flew along the ground,
and then with their wheels parting contact with
the earth up they started at an easy incline.
The roar of the motor already drowned most of
the clamor from the surging crowd, while the
racket of the whizzing propeller added to the
chorus so joyous to the ears of all real air pilots,
since nothing pleases them more than to feel they
are masters of a ship that is in “apple-pie” condition
for battling whatever lies ahead, be it
storm, fog or whatnot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Somehow Perk was twisting his head around
as if curious to ascertain whether that Ryan
crate had succeeded in imitating their example,
and was already making the preliminary dash
across the field—which luckily enough had
chanced to be fairly clear of maneuvering
planes, either descending, taking off, or being
taxied into position for the next stunt on the
program.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was getting well along by this
time, and already the first dim shadows of approaching
night were to be seen slipping
out from certain patches of pine trees ahead.
But the higher they climbed, now that a start
had been accomplished, the lighter it would become,
what with a lower horizon, and the sun
still hanging in plain sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once free from any possibility of any contact
with the wheeling and ducking planes—some of
which were doing the barrel roll, and others
making successive somersaults, with the daring
pilots proceeding while in an inverted position—Jack
could start spiraling, and climbing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rapidly was Candler Field fading from view
behind them since Jack had swung toward the
south, as if to lay his course directly for New
Orleans. Perk seemed to find a subtle attraction
back where they had just come from, since he
was again turning his head with nothing else to
do save gratify his innocent curiosity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! ’pears like they might be meaning to
strike for the Louisiana canebrake country, and
black bear diggings, just like I said,” he was
telling himself, with a chuckle of amusement
over his shrewd guess. “And say, that little
Ryan crate’s no slouch ’bout making speed, I’d
mention. Come along you sportin’ crowd—plenty
of room in the ceiling overhead, an’ nixey
a chance to bring about a collision. Take your
choice, and cut out for all you’re worth, boys.
If you get there before we do, just tell ’em we’re
acomin’ too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk continued to amuse himself in watching
the antics of the rival ship, and indulging in
all kinds of wild speculations as to what the real
object of those two sporty looking occupants
might prove to be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently thus far not the slightest suspicion
had entered his mind that the taking to the air
of the shining Ryan boat had the first thing to
do with their own skipping out, and heading
toward the Crescent City.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like as not when it gets real dark after a
bit,” Perk continued to say, being addicted to
talking to himself more or less, “we’ll soon lose
her, and have the field all to ourselves. Only
moving thing I c’n sight back there, ’cept them
circlin’ buzzards huntin’ for a carrion supper.
Guess everything’s going along first class
and we’re in for a comfortable night run down
over the corn and sugarcane country. This is
the life for little Perk, you hear me saying,
everybody—it’s got the boxin’ game, and even
that outdoor life up with the Mounties in Canada,
beat to a frazzle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk busied himself with his duties for
some time, and presently became aware of the
fact that evening was actually at hand; for the
sun had dropped out of sight over in the far
west, and looking down he found it absolutely
impossible to distinguish what lay beneath them
some two thousand feet more or less earthward—there
might be forests, farms, hills or swales
following each other in rapid succession; but all
masked by the sable curtains of night. When
the moon rose later on, its light would not afford
them any opportunity for marking any peculiarities
of the ground down there, since it must
simply present the appearance of a swiftly moving
panorama.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, moved once more by his old curiosity
concerning the ship that had started off immediately
after their own jump, again twisted his
head so as to take another backward look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hanged if she ain’t keeping on our tail right
along,” he told himself, as if a bit surprised,
though not in the least troubled, since there
could be no possible connection between this
Ryan monoplane and their own old bus, bent
on reeling off so many miles per hour, and aiming
to make the airport at New Orleans by early
dawn or before, according to how the weather
treated them, and the speed Jack could coax
from his aerial steed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Further inspection convinced Perk that the
rival ship was neither gaining nor losing as the
two sped along their way; a fact that began to
make him “sit up and take notice,” and then
express himself confidentially:</p>

<p class='c013'>“By jinks! it looks to me like that clever little
Ryan bus could make circles around our tub
’less Jack c’n squeeze a lot more snap from our
Whirlwind motor. Now what game c’n that
pair of sports be playin’ right now, I want to
know—must be they’re so used to bettin’ on
anything an’ everything they’re meanin’ to keep
right on our tail all night long, just to make us
hump along, and get the laugh on us poor
guys.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c014'>CHAPTER IV <br /> <br />THE GRIM PURSUER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>As the minutes crept along Perk’s uneasiness
commenced to make itself more manifest, finally
reaching such a condition that he felt it would
ease his mind if only he could get the opinion
of his companion on the subject.</p>

<p class='c013'>To do this it would be necessary that they
should make use of the head earphones that had
been taken along for this particular purpose.
Accordingly he quickly adjusted his own, and
then proceeded to advise Jack as to what he
wished to do. Since these useful adjuncts of the
pilot’s outfit were so arranged that they could
be slipped on and off with little loss of time,
it was an easy matter for Perk to apply them,
after which he went on to speak.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, seems like that pesky little Ryan insect’s
been tailing us right along, though mebbe
now you didn’t notice it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know it, Perk—fact is I proved that fact
to my own satisfaction, for twice now I’ve
changed our course, once into the west, and
again heading into the southwest, even if it
didn’t catch your attention.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You did that same; and say, what happened,
Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a blessed thing,” came the immediate
answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They still hung on our tail, do you mean,
old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like they did—queer how two pilots,
strangers both, would take a notion to change
their course, not once but twice running,” commented
Jack in his non-committal fashion that
always had Perk guessing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Strikes me as something more than a happy
chance,” asserted Perk, beginning to throw off
that comfortable feeling with which he had
wrapped himself as he contemplated a steady
going night run, with never a reason for anything
gripping them by way of excitement;
“ev’ry little movement of that Ryan two-seater’s
got a meanin’ of its own. Now what ails the
ducks I want to know—how c’n our movements
have a mite to do with what they’re planning
to carry out—got any idea along them lines, old
hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing definite as yet,” answered Jack; “I
was starting to figure it out just when you barged
in, and opened this talk fest up with your question.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, come to think of it, what did you make
out of that stiff yarn Scotty put over on us a
while ago?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was raw stuff for a fact; but I don’t question
anything he told us, remember, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whoever his mysterious visitor was he must
have been hunting for something, that’s dead
sure!” declared Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Something he didn’t find, either,” continued
Jack’s assistant pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Scotty was ready to swear to that fact, and
he ought to know.” Jack countered by saying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“But see here, old hoss, you’ve got some sorter
idea what the game might abeen, haven’t you
for a fact?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon I know why the sneak thief failed
to carry away the thing he was looking for, if
that’s what you mean, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As what, boss—I’m all worked up wantin’
to know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perhaps the reason might have been because
the object of his search happened at that very
time to be safe and snug in the inside pocket
of this same coat I’m wearing under my overalls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At hearing this startling announcement Perk
gave a quick look into his pal’s face, there being
just enough light remaining in the western sky
to allow this searching glance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! now I’m beginning to get somewhere,
and ready to quit this gropin’ around,
like a man in a London fog—that letter you had
this very morning from Headquarters—somehow
’r other some of the gang had wind of your
gettin’ it, and they guessed it’d be kept
safe under lock and key in your room at the
hotel; and then they got balled up about the
number on the door, so they broke into the wrong
room. Jack, am I on the right track?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems that’s so, according to my notion,
Perk; unless I miss my guess that’s the way
things stand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A disgusted grunt from Perk told that he did
not feel very happy over certain facts in the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gosh-a-mighty!” he burst out, explosively,
“if that’s right, then the tricky crowd know you’n
me are on this case—that even right now we’re
starting out to pluck their tail feathers, and
fetch that master-crook to the bar!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! I expected that would happen,” said
Jack, indifferently. “Having been told by several
of the best men in the service that Slim was
the smartest all-round dopester known in all the
land, I anticipated that he’d have means for
finding out that fact long ago—that there might
be a leak around Headquarters; for spies can
worm in almost anywhere, given an opportunity,
and the backing of a big bunch of jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yet that fact don’t seem to rattle you worth
a red cent, old hoss,” continued the puzzled
Perk, who ofttimes found the actions of his cool
partner a mystery he could not solve, because of
his own more impetuous ways.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope not,” was all Jack said in reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thunder and lightning!” ejaculated the co-pilot,
as if an illuminating idea had suddenly
flashed through his brain—“that Ryan bus,
Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what of it?” demanded the one at the
stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What if that sporty guy I told you about
should turn out to be the critter who broke into
Scotty’s room, and made it a complete wreck?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It could happen that way, Perk; seems like
you’re working on a warm scent right now. Pity
we didn’t get a good look at the gentleman before
he hid his face behind that helmet and goggles;
then at least we’d know him if ever we happened
to run across his trail.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The other was almost frothing at the mouth
through disgust and anger combined; but he
managed to say, with a select few hard words
interlarded as a vent to his outraged feelings:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Give me half a chance and I’ll mark him so
there’s be no difficulty in locating the sneak when
we meet him again—I’d put a bit of lead
through his arm that’d keep him out of the scrap
for a week of Sundays; or else clip off one of
his ears, to stamp him as a low-down crook.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack knew full well that this was no idle threat
on the part of his running mate; for Perk had a
reputation as a pistol shot second to none in the
entire service, being a natural born marksman.</p>

<p class='c013'>He lapsed into a spell of silence after making
that vicious remark; but from the way he
glanced back again and again it looked as
though Perk meant to keep close tabs on the
craft that was dogging their own ship so
steadily.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were roaring on their way, and it would
seem as if they must be showing a clean pair of
heels to anything in their rear; but just the same,
Perk, with the vision of an air-minded individual,
could readily understand how the speedy
Ryan plane was slowly but insidiously picking
up on them continuously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blamed nuisance,” he was muttering to himself
when this important fact became a positive
truth; “guess now that rip-snorter could make
circles round us, if so be he wanted to. Shucks!
what’s left to us I want to know; an’ just what
does he ’spect to accomplish with all this chasin’
us? Might as well get out my little old
six-shot bear gun, so’s to be ready in case
there’s any sort o’ ruction aheadin’ our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The idea seemed to afford him a strange sort
of grim satisfaction, for bending down he ran
his hand under the coaming of the cockpit; to
almost immediately withdraw a very decent
looking sporting repeating rifle, evidently his
working tool whenever he felt disposed to spend
a week in the wilds, either alone, or with some
boon companions also yearning for wild game
and the much desired campfire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold tight, Perk,” Jack was saying just
then; “going into a nose dive, and see if that
will upset his calculations; for he’s got me buffaloed
all right as to what’s in the wind!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Almost immediately they turned the nose of
their craft earthward, and went down on a
swift slant. Perk kept his head turned even as
this maneuvre was being executed, and what he
saw was something calculated to almost take
his breath away; for where the pursuing Ryan
ship loomed up as a shadowy form, vivid
splashes, as of fire, were coming in quick succession—he
could even imagine he heard the pulsating
staccato reports following each other in
succession, just as in those never-to-be-forgotten
days when he would have a covey of
devil-may-care German air fighters stepping on
the tail of his old-fashioned boat, and peppering
him from their rapid-firing guns!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c014'>CHAPTER V <br /> <br />THE DUEL IN THE AIR</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The significant flashes abruptly ceased; but
Perk realized this was only because the expert
pilot handling that same Ryan wasp was also
ducking down in an exact copy of their own
game.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the moment Perk lost sight of the shadowy
pursuing craft; then Jack changed his tactics,
and once again brought his boat on an even
keel. Perk strained his eyesight in an endeavor
to pick up the other ship after it too had swung
into a direct course.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Devil take that guy at the stick,” he stormed
to himself, although Jack caught almost every
word, since the earphones were still in operation,
“he’s seen our move, an’ gone us one better.
No slouch o’ a pilot, either, I’ll admit. When
that gent who goes by the name o’ Slippery Slim
picks his gang he knows how to pull trumps
out of the pack all right. Give him another
shoot, Jack, old hoss; mebbe he wont be so lucky
next time. He’s got some kind o’ a rapid-fire
shooter aboard, and had started to send a hail
o’ lead ’bout our ears just as you turned the trick
on him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was apparently quite willing to give a
repeat, for hardly had the other ceased shouting
than they again shot down in a dizzy dive
that seemed likely to lower their altitude by
something like five hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was keeping a close watch, and knew
that once more the grim pursuer had copied
their daring maneuvre.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s a good one, or I’ll eat my hat!” he burst
out, as they were “cutting a blue streak” once
more through the growing darkness, and he
could see those suggestive flashes again punctuating
the gloom in their track. “Jack, he’s
started that racket again, don’t you know; and
any second we may get a slug in our belly, bustin’
things all to flinders. Try a razzle-dazzle on
the boob, old broncho!”</p>

<p class='c013'>So making a bank, Jack changed his course,
running at right angles, and if anything at a
faster pace than ever. Perk had the situation
“sized up to a fraction,” as he himself would
have called it; he realized that it was only
through the greatest of good luck they had escaped
being hit by one of those flying missiles;
and that so long as the mysterious enemy kept
using their ship for a flying target they were in
constant peril. Despite all this ducking and
dodging on Jack’s part he did not seem successful
in throwing the pursuing craft off the track.
To be sure the darkness was gradually growing
thicker with every passing minute, and this
seemed to be their only hope of crawling out of
a “hot hole,” according to Perk’s calculations.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk afterwards frankly admitted that he was
frothing at the mouth on account of finding himself
up against a situation where the cards
seemed stacked against him—where his hands
were tied as it were, and that reckless pilot, chasing
after them hell-bent, held all the trumps.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No use tryin’ that game any longer, Jack,
boy!” he yelled suddenly. “See the glim all
’round us, partner—sure as you live they’ve
even got some kind o’ a searchlight aboard, just
like they’d planned all this thing out beforehand.
Guess now it’s up to Little Perk to put
a plug into their game. Hold her steady a bit,
boss; I’m meaning to make ’em sit up an’ take
notice they can’t hog <i>all</i> the fun going. Watch
my smoke, Jack, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a delicate situation without any doubt;
for if those aboard that little Ryan plane, taking
advantage of the halo of light covering the craft
they followed, continued to make use of their
rapidfire gun, the danger of a hit had vastly increased;
but Perk must have some sort of scheme
in mind it was evident, or he would never have
asked his chum to steady the badly wobbling
boat when such action only doubled their peril.</p>

<p class='c013'>Calmly and deliberately, as though simply
bent on fetching down a deer he wanted for
his next camp supper, steady old Perk had his
faithful gun up to his shoulder, and was sighting
that piercing glare of light that marked the bow
of the pursuing aircraft, betraying the presence
of a searchlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Possibly owing to the clamor of their own
working motor Jack could not tell when his
companion unloosed a fusilade of shots; but he
did know that something suddenly changed the
situation, and to their advantage; for as though
a blanket had been tossed over the piercing
ray the illumination abruptly ceased, leaving
them to continue their wild flight shrouded in
encompassing darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, too, the sound of Perk’s exulting yell
was quite enough to tell the story of his success
in finding a glowing target for one of his several
missiles—the old sharpshooter had evidently
lost none of his cunning by reason of a lapse in
action.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Set ’em up in the other alley, boys—give your
Dutch uncle a chance to show an old trick or
two! Now <i>will</i> you be good, or must I give
you another smash in the jaw—better haul off
while the haulin’s good, fellers—I’d sure hate to
make you crack up, and fade out!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Even though his clever shot had doubtless
utterly smashed the searchlight, and put it out
of business, that bothersome rapidfire gun was
still in working order, as Perk discovered when
once more those insistent flashes, following closely
upon each others’ heels, announced a fresh
barrage, with the unseen, unheard hissing bullets
doubtless whizzing all around them.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was adding insult to injury, Perk was
doubtless telling himself, as he realized that his
lucky shot had after all failed to daunt that
stubborn pair in the speedy Ryan ship.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You <i>will</i> have it, seems like,” he growled
to himself; for since he had discarded his earphone
harness just previous to starting his late
“shooting spree,” Perk could no longer hold
intercourse with his fellow flyer; “all right then,
I’ll try some more o’ the same sorter medicine;
what’s good for the goose orter be fine for the
gander. Mind your eye now, boys, and keep
a tight grip on your chutes if anything happens
not down in your gamble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again did the continual flash of spitting fire
from the gun afford the sharpshooter in the
chased ship abundant opportunities for focussing
his aim; although instinct may have
taken the place of vision on Perk’s part.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fortunately Jack must have been expecting
something along those lines, knowing his companion
so well, and how he was always eager
to “repeat” when things were coming his way;
for he kept the flying boat wonderfully steady
just then, even though realizing how such action
doubled their own chances of being hit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was now shooting on general principles,
in hopes of being fortunate enough to find a
billet for one of his random bullets. He went
at the business with all the <i>sang froid</i> of a veteran
fighter, accustomed to meeting hostile
craft up in the wide air spaces, or even above
the clouds—all the fierce delight of matching
his skill and life against a foeman worthy of his
steel had once more gripped the old flying warrior;
and it may be for the moment he deluded
himself with the belief that this was but a reincarnation
of those never-to-be-forgotten days
when all Europe was held fast in the throes of
the grisly war-god.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly Perk ceased firing, nor was this
caused by the magazine of his repeating rifle
being empty—he had seen that the discharges
back yonder were no longer in full blast, showing
that something must have happened to cause
such a sudden cessation to hostilities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before he could attempt to analyze what this
might mean it was all flashed before his questioning
mind—a burst of flames came from the
spot where last he had seen the shadowy shape
of their persistent pursuer clipping through
space like a blazing meteor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk sat there doubled up, his mouth half
open, staring with might and main, as some
object began to drop toward the earth with ever
increasing speed—something which he knew
full well must of necessity be the beautiful little
Ryan plane, which he had admired so much
when at Candler Field at close of the late day,
and before this wild dash into the darkness of
night began.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently one of his missiles (fired with such
grim determination when he “took the bit in
his teeth,” and struck back) had found its mark,
and unleashed the dangerous contents of the
gasoline reservoir, with the splashing fluid instantly
catching fire from the exploding spark
of the running motor.</p>

<p class='c013'>No flyer ever saw his enemy going down in a
flaming coffin without feeling compassion gripping
him; that one moment had changed his
heart from bitter hatred to a sense of pity; knowing
as he must have done that the day might
be near at hand when he too would share in a
similar dreadful fate.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so Perk found himself all in a nervous
tremble as, laying down his gun, he managed
once more to adjust the head harness, so as to
be able to again hold communication with his
fellow adventurer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c014'>CHAPTER VI <br /> <br />PARACHUTE JUMPERS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Just then Jack hurriedly banked, and swung
around as though to double back on their late
course. This of course told Perk the pilot must
be already aware of the terrible tragedy that
was being enacted close at hand, and meant to
see its finish with his own eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the abrupt change in their course he
was in time to catch a glimpse of the flaming
object still spiraling earthwards, a billow of fire
that glowed suggestively in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then far below it seemed to strike the ground—they
heard no sound whatever, but the fire
became stationary; although increasing in fury,
since the wind created by its passage no longer
whipped the devouring flames. Evidently by
the time the conflagration stopped for want of
further material on which to feed, nothing inflammable
would be left of the once haughty
little Ryan masterpiece save the engine, and
other metal parts.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the big idea, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk asked this as a leader, wishing to get a
better grip on his own nerves, since they had
been dreadfully shocked at the dire result of his
random shot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Going to circle around a few times, and drop
down a bit,” came the illuminating reply;
“though I reckon it’s no use, since nothing could
live in all that awful blast.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe not, Jack,” remarked Perk, a bit
cheerily; “but there’s a fair chance neither o’
them guys got snagged in the flash o’ that gas.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Perk, have you some foundation
for saying that?” demanded the other, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure—they jumped all right, boss,” Perk
told him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You saw them do it then, did you, boy?”
continued Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They bailed out okay—I saw two take the
jump right after the first flash came—went down
like plummets in the bargain—smart lads those
guys are, I’m tellin’ you, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>No doubt Jack was glad to hear this bit of
news, for it had filled him with horror to realize
that in order to escape they had been compelled
to ruthlessly take human life. He was
much younger than Perk, veteran of the World
War, who had grown more or less hardened
to such happenings when staking his own life
against that of a tricky German air pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Still goin’ down, are you?” asked Perk shortly
afterwards, on finding that they were still
swinging around in a wide circle, that burning
pyre far below being the hub of the wheel of
which their boat was the outer tire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Might as well,” came the ready answer,
showing that Jack had made up his mind
hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess now they’ll get down somehow, boss;
a whole lot depends on what kind o’ landin’
they’ll be able to make—if its rocks, or trees,
they got to strike it’s apt to be some hard sleddin’
for the boys. Say, ’taint possible now you’re
fixin’ to try an’ lend ’em a helpin’ hand? I’d
hate to know they’d been wiped off the map in
that hot fire; but somehow I don’t feel like
playin’ the part o’ the Good Samaritan to such
man devils as them two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No danger of my trying to make a landing
where the chances are ten to one it just <i>can’t</i> be
done,” explained Jack, seeing that his companion
was almost ready to mutiny if any such mad
proceeding were contemplated. “I’d just feel
better if I knew they’d reached ground okay;
then we could keep on our way, and it’d be up
to them to get out of the scrape.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! I get you, partner,” grunted the relieved
Perk. “Don’t think I’m bitter about the
thing, ’cause they’re sure hot stuff all right; but
I’m a bit slow to accept that forgive and forget
stuff, specially after any guy’s tried his level
best to gimme a dirty deal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll try the thing out while on the job,”
Jack announced. “Our own wonderful escape
from meeting just that same kind of fate makes
me kind of soft. Perhaps we’ll not be able to
learn a single thing; you know how it often is
when you’ve finally struck ground after quitting
the ship by the chute route—all out of breath—sometimes
knocked up a bit, if you escape broken
bones—not any shape to shout, or do anything
but just lie there, and suck in the air in big
gasps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, that’s right for you, old hoss,” Perk
readily agreed. “Me, I once got a collar bone
smashed that way. No harm in our makin’ a
few swings around these diggin’s ’fore we put
out for Orleans. That fire keeps burnin’ like
things they got sprinkled right well with the
juice when the tank blew up. Go to it, Jack,
just as you please, never mindin’ a few squeals
from a hard-boiled guy like Perk Perkiser.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m going to shut down on the engine, and
take a little glide, so we can pick up anything
like a yell,” announced the pilot a minute later.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to it—duck then, boy!” snapped Perk,
as he temporarily relieved himself of his ear-phones
in order to catch anything bordering on
a shout from the ground below.</p>

<p class='c013'>The simple expedient was carried out successfully,
and when once again they leveled out,
to continue circling, Jack asked eagerly:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get anything, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a bleat, partner,” replied the other, who
had hurriedly held his earphones in position so
as to cover the emergency.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sorry for that, but we’ll try a couple more
times before calling it all off,” suggested Jack,
who could be more or less persistent when the
occasion arose for such action, though never
carrying it so far as to be reckless.</p>

<p class='c013'>So a dozen seconds or so afterwards he again
gave warning that it was time for another drop
of a few hundred feet—not that they meant to
take any chances by getting too close to the unknown
terrain lying in the pitch blackness under
the flying ship; but simply to be able to listen
with the horrid clamor of the bustling engine
momentarily stilled.</p>

<p class='c013'>No better success followed this second maneuvre—all
was deathly silent around, above,
below, as though never a solitary living human
being existed within miles of the spot where
the destruction of the Ryan monoplane had
taken place.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll give a third and last try,” was Jack’s
announced decision, to which Perk added:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Three times, and batter’s out—by then I rather
guess we’ll be down close enough to the solid
ground to make another drop dangerous. Either
way I’m satisfied we’ve done the right thing,
old hoss. Suit yourself when you see fit to
coast,” whereupon he once more denuded his
ears of the exceedingly useful and really indispensable
phone harness, to await the occasion
of the last try in the line of an aviator’s
duty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it, Perk?—get a whisper?”</p>

<p class='c013'>They had completed the glide, and were once
more on a level course, with Jack even turning
the nose of the ship a bit heavenward; since
neither of them knew what the nature of the
ground below must be—whether some hill lay
directly ahead, against which they might smash
for a complete wipeout.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! a heap more’n that, partner!” came
the triumphant reply. “Heard a shout, an’ then
another some distance off—struck me both
jumpers had lit okay, and were tryin’ to communicate,
so’s to get together again. Guess
things ain’t so bad after all with them guys, an’
we c’n be movin’ on our way without botherin’
any more ’bout their safety. Some two-legged
varmints seem to be watched over by Old Satan
hisself, they bein’ that venomous, and evil-minded.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack made no rejoinder to this remark, tinged
with bitterness as it was, only pointed the nose
of his craft upward, and started to spiral for
altitude. Undoubtedly he was feeling greatly
relieved because of their having escaped so
miraculously from the hovering peril; and best
of all managed to turn the tables on those who
would have encompassed their destruction just
in order to defend the lawless game in which
they were engaged in connection with Slippery
Slim.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk must have been doing a little hard thinking
as the time passed and they raced on their
way, for later on he started to speak; and as
usual his line of chatter told that he was seeking
information, trying to find a solution of
certain exasperating puzzles that were “twisting
his intellects,” as he himself described
matters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Things kind o’ got me goofy, partner, an’
I’d like you to raise the curtain some, if so be
you feel so bent. First place I guess it goes
without questionin’ that these huskies must be
in cohunks with that there big gun, Slippery
Slim Garrabrant?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! that’s a dead certainty—who else would
have any reason for waylaying us in Atlanta,
and setting up this trap for us to fall into?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! then it stands to reason, boss, he’s
got means for findin’ out what the Secret Service
aims to do; an’ so has been able to play the boys
for suckers every time they set out to lay him
by the heels, eh, Jack, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s past history, Perk; even the Big Boss
got wise to it, and tried everything possible to
learn where the great leak happened; but our
experience proves they haven’t discovered it so
far. I’m making up my mind that the closer
we draw to the headquarters of this rotten clique
of crime, where they make the bogus long-green
that’s been flooding the whole West for a year
and more, why, the harder our job is bound
to be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which tickles me a heap, boy—I’m just
yearnin’ for comin’ to grips with that gazaboo
o’ a Slim; and now we’re on to the job I’ll never
be happy ’till he’s on his way to that big Government
pen we glimpsed in Atlanta, where
some other lads we helped to pinch are doin’
time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if you keep on as you’ve started, Perk,
we’ll flatten the whole gang like pancakes—they’ve
stacked up against a new sort of revenue
dog when they started a shooter of your calibre
on the trail. First you smashed their searchlight,
and then sent a chuck of lead into the
gas tank that broke up the game. That’s the
kind of a pinch hitter you are, partner; and
right now I want to congratulate you on such
dandy marksmanship.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lay off that stuff, Jack—nothin’ but great
luck fetched the bacon home for this lad. But
me, I’m shakin’ hands with myself ’cause I
had that hunch a bear gun mightn’t be such a
bad thing to tote along on a trip that’s goin’ to
carry us across the border, an’ into Old Mex,
like as not; where the greasers are sometimes
tough nuts an’ hard to handle they tell me.
’Spose we’ll run across them two hill billies
again, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wouldn’t surprise me a bit if we did,” replied
the pilot, leveling off at a three thousand
foot ceiling, and still heading due southwest.
“Like as not they’ve got plenty of ready cash
along; and after having been so cleverly upset in
their calculations, due to your beating them silly
with a barrage of hot lead, they’ll be hot to wipe
out their disgrace. Oh! yes, we’re going to run
up against that foxey pair again before the book
is closed for keeps.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c014'>CHAPTER VII <br /> <br />STRIKING THE FOG BELT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>With the stars shining brightly above them,
and a moon just past its full climbing the eastern
heavens, having dissipated the darkness of the
earlier part of the night, Jack and his fellow
voyager continued plunging along in a very
satisfactory fashion, having no reason for feeling
further concern regarding the peril to
which they had been so lately subjected.</p>

<p class='c013'>But things were not destined to continue so
comfortably for the two adventurers, it seemed.
Perk was just congratulating himself for about
the fourth time at having such a comfortable
flight, when he sat up and took notice of the
fact that those heavenly bodies were beginning
to look exceedingly hazy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Danged shame, that’s what, to spoil such a
dandy night!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What ails you now?” demanded Jack, on
hearing the other make this little remark that
bespoke exasperation at least; “another boat on
our tail?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I guess not just now,” replied Perk,
scoffingly; “one was more’n enough for a single
jump. But we’re agoin’ to run into a pesky
fog belt, sure as you’re born, old hoss!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That all?” laughed the other, who apparently
saw nothing of particular consequence
about such a common happening; “it may perhaps
manage to slow us down more or less; but
what does that matter, when we’ve got time to
burn. The Big Boss told us, remember, not to
hurry things at all—plenty of time, oodles of
money, and any backing we chose to call for in
the way of a new boat, or more helpers. We
should worry, old scout!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Tain’t that in peticular Jack,” complained
the other; “but of all things a sky detective’s got
to run smack up against, fog’s the one I despise
most. It’s got me in bad more’n a few times, so
I’ve grown to look on the peasoup stuff like it
was my—er, what-dye-call it—Nebraska, no, I
mean Nemesis.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, now you mention it, Perk, I remember
you telling me something about that strange feeling
you have creep over you. No need for you
to apologize—in my knocking around among airmen
I’ve found that often even the most daring
and reckless in the bunch had some kind of a
weakness, if only you looked far enough under
the surface; just as sometimes you’ll find a boasting
bully actually afraid of his little wife at
home, who’s smacked him with her handy rolling
pin many a time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! wasn’t I a canvas man ’long with a
travelin’ circus a wheen o’ years ago, an’ didn’t
I see the biggest elephant in captivity rear up
on his hind legs, lift his trunk sky-high in the
air, an’ squeal like fun just when a little half
grown mouse happened to run along near his
alley. Well, I’m the tusker, an’ fog is the
mouse, as you might say—we never do get on
well as a combine. Hope it hugs the ground,
an’ leaves us a clear track up among the clouds
I c’n see creepin’ up ahead yonder.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Doesn’t bother me a whit, partner; don’t
forget we’ve got that new radio beacon aboard
to try out; and if it’s as clever as I’ve heard tell
it’ll carry us along our route to Orleans through
the thickest nest of fog anybody ever stacked up
against. Naturally we can’t expect to get the
full benefit of its capacity to hold a speeding
plane on its true course; because the invention’s
hardly more than half baked up to now; but I
set it according to directions, and if at any time
we begin to slide off our course the light that
springs up is bound to give warning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A bully good layout I’d say, if it c’n do what
they claim,” ventured Perk, who undoubtedly
had read certain things concerning the new invention,
and was eager to learn just how it would
pan out. “You showed a level head, partner,
when you decided to take the offer o’ that gent
in Atlanta, and try the thing out. Guess, then,
I needn’t bother my head ’bout gettin’ astray;
if things keep bein’ invented it ain’t goin’ to be
very long till a pilot’ll get slapped good an’
hard if he misses runnin’ on a straight line, or
even veers from his proper course in a great big
blow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re living in a machine age, Perk, and
every day things are heading that way on the
run—electric helps in kitchen, factory, and even
aboard our air cruisers. While the brainwork
and strain grow harder the actual manual labor
is lessened all the time. But as you say it’s getting
a bit hazy, and chances are we’re in for a
spell of blue fog.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Ten minutes afterwards there could not be
the least doubt concerning that fact, for by degrees
even the stars vanished from view, ditto
the gorgeous round moon. Still, since the sky
remained brighter in the east, it was not at all
difficult to tell where the fair mistress of the
Southern night had hidden her face behind the
opaque veil.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was now flying by instruments alone,
since never a thing could be seen by the keenest
eye above, below—they seemed to be hung in
unlimited space; but pushing along with considerable
speed just the same, bound for the distant
city on the vast Mississippi, situated not so
very far from its delta.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus passed a full hour.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly Perk saw a small light spring into
view on one side of the plane, and it certainly
electrified him considerably.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hi! there, partner, we’re off our track—shifted
to the east, seems like, unless I’m away
wrong in sizin’ things up ’cordin’ to Hoyle.
Got to swing her to the larboard-watch side, I
kinder guess—how ’bout that, boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You hit it that time, Perk, and here she goes
to climb back to our true course. Worked just
as we figured it would, and put us wise to a fact
we’d hardly have picked up in any other way.
I reckon now this same radio beacon’s bound to
turn out a great help to the poor badgered air
pilot, flying blind when fog hides the ground
beacons, and he gets no aid from the heavens
above.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll say it’s the best thing I’ve struck for a
long time,” affirmed the delighted Perk.
“There she goes—the glim I mean—closed shop,
havin’ ’complished the business set for her;
showing we must have struck our real course
again.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Easy money,” laughed Jack, just as well satisfied.
“Makes a fellow sit up and try to guess
what the next big idea connected with aviation
will prove to be; doesn’t seem to be any limit to
the dazzling discoveries these scientific chaps’ll
turn out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, partner—like that big chute they’re
trying out, which they claim will keep any
plane from crashing—if the engine goes dead
all you got to do is to press a little button, and
when the drop comes open goes the monster umbrella,
able to hold you and the crate suspended
in the air, to gradually fall to the earth like the
colored balls from a bursted skyrocket. Great
stunt that, an’ I’m livin’ in hopes it’ll be my
luck to some day find myself aboard a ship that’s
equipped with such a giant chute, an’ have the
glorious experience of seeing the thing work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack seemed to consider it the part of wisdom
to pull up more or less, as they were in no hurry,
and could drop down on the aviation field at
New Orleans by dawn, even though they concluded
to just “loaf along.” Disliking anything
pertaining to fog Perk naturally said nothing
to hint at a desire for further speed; besides
his own good sense told him that what his mate
had just said with regard to no necessity existing
for haste, was sound logic, and a due regard
for “safety first.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So the time slipped away, with midnight finding
them past the meridian of their projected
flight. Perk had long since subsided and
seemed content to sit there in the double cockpit,
letting his thoughts roam back to the exciting
developments of the earlier night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Years had elapsed since last he watched a
doomed plane writhing and twisting in its death
agonies, with the flames wrapping it in an envelope—a
blazing coffin speeding headlong to a
final crash; and here, strange to say, after all
that time intervening he had again passed
through a similar experience. Now that he had
an opportunity to calmly review the happening,
Perk admitted he was pleased to know the two
occupants of the Ryan cockpit had apparently
escaped a miserable fate that must have been
laid at his door.</p>

<p class='c013'>Two A. M. and all’s well!</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk figured that when a few more times
sixty minutes had passed it would be time for
them to catch a first glimpse of the great rolling
turgid stream that could, when the heavy rains
united with the melting snows up in the mountains
of the Far West, create vast floods that
placed much of the low country along the river
under many feet of water. It had been a long
time since last Perk had set eyes on the Mississippi,
and hence he was considerably worked
up over the prospect of soon glimpsing the
mighty flood.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c014'>CHAPTER VIII <br /> <br />NEW ORLEANS—FIRST STOP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“There she rolls, Jack, old boy—the greatest
stream in the whole U.S.A.—I swan if she
don’t look just as fine as when I glimpsed her
for the first time many years ago!”</p>

<p class='c013'>That was Perk’s tribute on beholding the
Lower Mississippi perhaps thirty miles above
New Orleans; he displayed almost as much enthusiasm
as those early discoverers did centuries
back, when their distended eyes took in the
mighty sweep of the flood rolling down toward
its junction with the Mexican Gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was early dawn, and the fog bank had been
dissipated by a fresh breeze acting as advance
courier to the rising of the sun. Jack, looking
toward the southwest could also see the object
of his companion’s exultation, and undoubtedly
felt some of the same pleasure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When it gets a bit lighter we’ll have a far distant
view of the city, with its smoke cloud hovering
over it,” he remarked, knowing that soft coal
and southern pine as used for fuel in the Fall
and Winter seasons always caused something of
a pall to mark the site of the river metropolis.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk reached around, and drew forth a case
that on being opened disclosed a pair of pretty
decent binoculars, with which they had been
fitted out by the Washington authorities before
starting on this particular man-hunt, with an
idea that they might prove most useful sooner
or later.</p>

<p class='c013'>After clapping these to his eyes Perk announced
that he could easily pick up the goal
of their flight from Candler Field; although the
smoke did act as a screen, through which it was
not possible to see with certainty.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was now bringing out all the reserve
speed of their ship—it was of some consequence
that they make a landing as early as possible,
since he had no desire to attract undue attention,
and possibly have inquisitive newspaper reporters
to be asking pertinent questions as to
whence they came, what their identities might
be when at home, and also concerning the object
of their coming to New Orleans. Secrecy
was the foundation on which they meant to
build their plans; and from their previous experience
with those dare devils in the employ of
Slippery Slim, too much care could not be employed
in order to mask their batteries.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, too, as they approached the city Jack was
dropping down to lower levels; while on his part
Perk skimmed the whole scene, looking for the
airport they knew to be somewhere within reach
of their vision.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being presently located he called his
chum’s attention to the open field, and in almost
no time they were circling it, looking for the
best place to land.</p>

<p class='c013'>Early though it was there were moving figures
circulating around, while some sort of ship
was coming in from over the river—possibly one
of the air mail carriers from a distant station, it
might be many hundred miles away, fetching
Uncle Sam’s important letter sacks, and worthwhile
express matter, at treble the speed that the
fastest train could muster.</p>

<p class='c013'>The landing was effected without the slightest
difficulty, and hardly had their boat come
to a stop than a number of persons, most of them
connected with the ground force of mechanicians
and hostlers, surrounded the incoming
craft, paying but scant attention to the air mail,
which dropped down almost at the same moment—that
was a daily happening, a following
out of a regular schedule, to which they had
become accustomed; while the arrival of a mysterious
plane might stand for almost anything.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold fast, Perk!” said Jack, as he took off
his headphones, and raising his voice to almost
a shout, so deaf did he appear after a whole
night’s run; “don’t tumble out yet; and keep a
muffler on your gab, for we’ve got to let ’em
take it out in guessing. I’ll soon see if the
party we’re expecting to meet is on hand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He still kept his helmet and goggles in position
as he thrust his head out of the cockpit, and
raising his right hand with two fingers extended,
made a species of salute. A stout man,
with a very red face, and an air of importance,
immediately pushed through the gathering
crowd, and answered Jack’s signal with a similar
sweep of his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s okay, Perk—that’s our party, and he’s
been watching for us, showing he had my wire
last evening. Get a move on, and we’ll soon be
doubling our legs under a breakfast table.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! but that will be a joy to me,
old hoss!” Perk exclaimed; “’cause I’m as
hungry as a wolf, an’ the smell o’ coffee is apt
to set me wild. Go to it, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was paying no attention to these vaporings,
since it was a common occurrence to have
old Perk declare the bottom of his stomach was
in danger of falling out—he had met the red-faced
gentleman and they were shaking hands
as they exchanged a few words.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all fixed, comrade,” he said to Perk over
his shoulder, mentioning no names lest suspicious
ears catch them, and thus have a clue as
to their identity; “we’ll get a few of these boys
to run our boat into a hangar close by, which is
waiting for us, and then cut out for the city—and grub.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This being speedily carried out, with the
doors fastened securely, and the two flyers began
to hastily divest themselves of their working
“duds.” Before ten minutes had passed
they were on their way in a taxi the gentleman
friend had brought out, with Jack and their
host talking at a great rate; while as for Perk
he was looking out, and finding more or less enjoyment
in seeing new and novel sights along
the road.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk having been well coached as to the
necessity for caution, made it a practice to snatch
an occasional glance in their rear, looking for
any signs to indicate that their car was being
trailed; but nothing at all suspicious came to
his attention.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meantime Jack had learned that their new
friend (whose name he already knew to be Mr.
Adkins) was connected with the Administration
forces of the United States District Attorney,
having offices in the Government building—that
he had been secretly advised of their coming
days before receiving Jack’s wire; and was
ready to give them all the information possible
concerning what had been learned in connection
with the wholesale operations of the man they
had been sent out to cage, so as to effectually
remove the greatest menace that had threatened
business men of the Southwest in a decade.</p>

<p class='c013'>In due time he would post them regarding
all these important facts; meanwhile they
could take things easy, for there was no hurry,
and the game was of too much importance to
allow lax methods. When they got good and
ready they could make a start, and after that
everything must depend on their ability to beat
Slippery Slim at his favorite game of “dog eat
dog.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He steered his guests to a certain restaurant
where he knew they could be well taken care
of, and which turned out to be close to the hotel
at which they booked under fictitious names.
Here Perk was given the privilege of ordering
just what he desired along the line of rashers of
bacon and fried eggs; cornbread with syrup;
several cups of coffee taken black; and to top off
with, a Havana cigar such as he was not accustomed
to smoking, being addicted to the more
friendly pipe habit.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no talk of shop while they partook
of breakfast; such business as they had to transact
was of too delicate a nature to be discussed
in a public place, where strangers would be
coming and going, and spying eyes might be on
them every minute of the time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Later they gathered in the room at the hotel
where, behind closed and locked doors they felt
free to confer in lowered tones.</p>

<p class='c013'>Much had to be told, and numerous thrilling
accounts brought out connected with adventures
experienced by other Secret Service men in their
efforts to round up the notorious gang—all of
which had resulted in absolute defeat for the
Government agents.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shrewd men some of these parties undoubtedly
were, with a record of numerous famous
cases successfully carried through; but somehow
when they found themselves up against
Slippery Slim Garrabrant they sooner or later
fell down on the job, and had to be recalled.</p>

<p class='c013'>In fact, it was disclosed to Jack and his pal,
two different agents were never again heard
from, after secret code messages had been received
from them to the effect that they were
even then getting very close to a great discovery
that must end in the arrest of the malefactor—a
dead silence that had never been broken
seemed to signify that they must have fallen into
some sort of fiendish trap, possibly meeting with
a gruesome fate that would be forever shrouded
in blank mystery.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins, watching closely as he narrated
these uncomfortable facts, was pleased to see
that neither of his interested auditors displayed
the least sign of being disturbed, showing that
they had long since discounted everything along
this line.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c014'>CHAPTER IX <br /> <br />COACHING PERK</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Of course it was in keeping with this exchange
of confidences that Jack should relate all that
had happened to them since their arrival in
Atlanta to secure the ship awaiting them, load
it to capacity for a long voyage, and finally start
off from Candler Field.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins listened eagerly to this modest
account of what had already happened to them
as a starter in the hunt they had undertaken;
and he was visibly thrilled at hearing of the
bitter night chase, the desperate tactics undertaken
by the pair of human wolves aboard the
Ryan monoplane; and particularly when Jack
finally described in vivid language the astounding
act of Perk in first shattering the bothersome
searchlight, to follow this with his lucky
random shot that bore into the gas tank of the
pursuing craft and brought about an explosion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Possibly the urbane gentleman had never in
all his life listened to so ghastly a true story as
the graphic one thus modestly related by one
of the two participants; looking at them, with
Jack so calm and modest, giving all the credit
to his grinning accomplice, he must have decided
in his astute mind that at last Slippery
Slim was going to have a pair of human bloodhounds
on his trail such as all his ingenuity and
vindictiveness combined could not throw into
the discard.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me have,” he went on to say to Jack, “as
good a description as possible of those same
bills your friend Scotty found in that pocketbook
dropped among his clothing by the unknown
party whom you believe was looking for
your letter of instructions from Washington.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When Jack complied with this request the
other nodded his head approvingly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question but what they were of the same
stripe as all the others that have been brought to
our attention,” he told Jack. “You must know
it’s been a mooted question as to whether the
plates from which these notes are being printed
in vast quantities (that make it a gold mine for
the gang) are counterfeits engraved by some
master in the art or stolen property, which have
somehow never been missed by the plant where
much of the printing is done for the Treasury
Department—the bills are so perfect that cashiers
and tellers are all at sea over the facts, so
that something of a near panic has resulted in
banking circles as a result of this unknown quantity.
Remember these are the old type of banknotes,
and not the new abbreviated form of currency,
so that it is more difficult to discover the
actual facts.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will all come out in the wash, sir,” remarked
Perk, sagaciously, with a sly wink at
his pal.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, Perk,” observed the gentlemanly official,
smilingly; “but I’m more concerned about
your plan of campaign than anything else right
now. During the time you stop over here in
Orleans I mean to keep you posted with regard
to any fresh news that comes in to Headquarters
for there is hardly a day when we do not learn
of additional discoveries connected with this deluge
of phony money that’s been dumped on the
whole Southwest by this hard working gang.
I am telling you everything that’s known or suspected,
so that you can figure out your best line
of action.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We understand that, Mr. Adkins,” said Jack,
nodding, “and you can rest assured we appreciate
your kindness more than I can tell you.
Before we jump off you will know what we’ve
decided to do, so as to pick up a warm trail;
and after that, sir, don’t be worried if you fail
to hear a single word from us for days, weeks,
or even months; but depend upon it we’ll be
working on the job every minute.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And never forget, I beg of you, that this
man is a devil for cruelty and craftiness—I’m
sure you’ll not delude yourselves that his arrest
will be an easy task; for as good men as were
ever on the roll of our Secret Service Department
have fallen down on the job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you again, sir, for your warning; but
we’re not meaning to feel anything like over-confidence,
so as to let the bars down. I understand
from my having been picked to take up
this case, that the knowledge of myself and my
assistant here along the line of aviation cut a big
figure in the appointment, since it has been
learned that Slim himself makes use of a flying
boat possibly to cross over from the wilds of
Mexico, it being suspected he has his plant
hidden away somewhere among the mountains,
where he doubtless keeps peace with the authorities
by paying tribute that insures his being left
undisturbed. We hope to change all that sooner
or later, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I admire your modesty, Jack,” continued the
Government official, who had warmed toward
the pair during the short time he had known
them, and seemed to take a personal interest in
their fortunes. “Remember to keep in touch
with Headquarters while in the city, so as to
notify me in case you need any assistance—I can
later on place a posse of oldtime Texas Rangers
at your service, if the occasion arises for a necessity
to show force—they are now working for
the Government as border patrols, and as you
can understand, are the same rough-riding, fearless
type that played such a leading figure in
the early history of the Lone Star State; for we
have authority that covers such matters. And
I’ll be one of the first to extend you my hearty
congratulations should you win out, and bring
in your man; as I’ve no doubt your good pal
here used to do when, as you’ve told me, he used
to work with the Canadian Mounted Police
force, in years gone by.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It won’t be our fault, sir, if we make a flop
o’ the job,” asserted Perk, who believed he ought
to get in an occasional word; although there
were a good many things he did not wholly
understand, and which he would depend on
Jack to further explain when opportunity arose.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins shook them both cordially by the
hand, and took his departure, leaving them to
digest all the startling facts he had placed in
their possession. By slow degrees they would
figure things out, and sketch their plan of operation;
then would come the hour when once more
they must depend on their wings to carry them
many hundreds of miles toward the scene of
action, where the air would be surcharged with
dynamite, while deadly enemies might be lying
in ambush, ready to take them by surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk started to spring his questions, and Jack
was only too glad to make the necessary explanations;
for it was necessary that they work in
complete harmony if they hoped to be successful.</p>

<p class='c013'>As far as they had gone, things looked hopeful
to Jack, as he marshalled the facts that had
lately been placed in their possession. He was
satisfied that when every item had been arranged
in its rightful sequence they could fashion a
plan of campaign that would at least have a
better chance for winning out than any of those
utilized by former detectives, who had not possessed
the essential wings so as to meet Slippery
Slim on his own chosen ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No tellin’ just how long we’ll stick it out in
this burgh, I guess, buddy?” suggested Perk,
some time later, as they continued to take things
easy, resting up after a hard night’s flight, and
meaning to get around the city after noon and
lunch time had come and passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Couldn’t say as yet, Perk; we’ve got to comb
out the stuff as handed over by our new friend,
Mr. Adkins, and discard everything that doesn’t
pan out as being worth while. Then there were
a few leaders he dropped that, if followed up,
might turn out to be leading clues, the possession
of which would possibly turn the tide of battle.
I’m meaning not to let anything make me show
undue speed—Rome wasn’t built in a day, we’ve
got to recollect, and so shape things from the
standpoint of ‘safety first’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! that’s the boy!” gurgled the pleased
Perk; “me, don’t I remember that story o’ the
hare an’ the tortoise runnin’ a race, which the
turtle won ’cause he never even stopped to rest
up; while the rabbit, thinkin’ he could run loops
around such a plodder, lay down to take a nap,
overslept himself, and when he got to the goal
there was Old Leatherback awaitin’ to turn the
big laugh on him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk wound up with one of his rollicking
laughs; everything seemed to create merriment
in his soul just now, after that royal breakfast;
though perhaps he was running away ahead of
the dry facts, and counting his chickens before
they were hatched out of the shell. But Perk
was confident the sly fox of a Slim would find
himself snagged in the net one of these days,
and the clever guy who handled things would
turn out to be an aviator and sky detective named
Jack Ralston.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack some time afterwards, had just aroused
from a short nap, when Perk, who had been
pondering and grumbling to himself, tossed out
another question, as if to disclose what was
troubling him:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it, old hoss, do you b’lieve them
dicks we left behind after they’d floated down
from a high ceilin’ with their chutes, got outen
the scrape, so they could a hiked to some nearby
village or town, an’ took the first train headed
for Orleans, reckonin’ we must a’been on the
jump thisaways?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say the chances all point that way, Perk,”
Jack told him, without the slightest hesitation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jumpin’ crickets! if that’s a fact why, a feller
might run acrost the slick pair any old minute—meet
’em right face to face!” Perk went on to
say, as if the fact gave him more or less concern.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose then you’d recognize the chappies
with just one look, eh, what about that, partner?”
asked Jack, laughingly; at which the other
grinned a bit foolishly, to admit he had serious
doubts on that score.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! didn’t either o’ us get a peep-in at
their monikers, worse luck—had them helmets
and goggles in place right away, like they didn’t
mean to give us a single look-in. S’pose now
they got the high sign on us boys?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“On a venture I’d say that was always possible,”
replied Jack, soberly; for this very point
had occurred to him, and was as yet unsettled
in his mind. “Nobody knows how long they may
have been in Atlanta—Mr. Adkins assured us
Slim seemed to have all sorts of strings out, so
as to learn in advance of any bunch of Government
agents taking the field against his giant
bogus money monopoly; and for all we can tell
those two may have been spying on us most
of the time we were around Candler Field, getting
our ship ready to take to the air.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rotten luck, I’m sayin’, and too much one-sided
to suit me,” growled Perk, frowning savagely.
“Here we got to do our work in the
dark; while that smart cuss holds all the high
cards in the pack, an’ c’n trump our ace any
time he takes a notion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No need to worry about that, comrade,” said
Jack, soothingly. “You must remember that
when we move along we mean to disappear as
if heading into the thickest belt of pea soup fog
ever seen—in that way they’ll lose all trace of
us, and we can play our cards as we choose, making
up for a different breed of sky travelers, so
as to dope the cleverest kind of spies he can send
out. While they’re left guessing what’s become
of us we’ll be doing our little tracking job, and
hour by hour, day after day, keep on creeping
closer to their secret stronghold, wherever that
may prove to be. Those are some of the things
we figured on doing, Perk, don’t forget.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The one addressed made no reply, but as he
let his head fall back, as if he meant to pick up
a few winks of sleep, there came a look of rapt
admiration on his weather-beaten face that bespoke
the utmost confidence in his best pal.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c014'>CHAPTER X <br /> <br />LAYING PLANS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>After a noonday lunch Jack and his partner
spent most of the afternoon in carrying out the
various duties that were seemingly on their program.
Among other things Jack visited the
Federal building, and was closeted for more
than an hour with Mr. Adkins.</p>

<p class='c013'>The latter official had conceived a great fancy
for young Ralston, and went to no end of trouble
so as to post him with regard to what he was
likely to run up against while endeavoring to
close in on Slippery Slim. With his accustomed
sagacity Jack made notes of some of the
facts thus laid before him; but since these were
in shorthand, and would be utterly unintelligible
to any outside party, should they chance
to fall into enemy hands, there was no danger
that any mischief would follow.</p>

<p class='c013'>By degrees he was filling up with scraps of
description, and everything connected with
former attempts at locating the hideout, where
all this unlawful scrip was being turned off the
press, to flood the Southwest.</p>

<p class='c013'>That was always his way of doing—when
given a tough job Jack would live alongside it,
breathing the very atmosphere of the undertaking,
until he found himself sympathetic with the
aims and ambitions of the criminals whose apprehension
was placed on his shoulders by his
Big Boss.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll have dinner early, Perk,” he told the
other, who had been carrying out a number of
special duties while Jack was busy elsewhere,
“so as to retire to our room at the hotel. No
going out after nightfall for us just at present,
especially in a strange city, where some sneak
might waylay us coming back from the theater.
All that sort of pleasure must be put out of our
heads just at present.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! guess you’re hittin’ the nail on the
head, old hoss, when you say that,” grunted
Perk, who very probably had already picked out
just the screen play he wanted so badly to see;
but he was a good scout, and able to put duty
above pleasure, when the occasion arose for
making a personal sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another thing,” continued Jack, “there’s no
telling what night flying we’re bound to be up
against, in trying to keep our movements secret;
so it’d be wise for us both to enjoy all the extra
sleep that comes our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, partner,” assented Perk, subordinating
his desires to the slogan which he knew
was Jack’s watchword—“safety first”. “When
I’ve stowed away all the grub I c’n hold mebbe
I’ll be ready to hit the hay, to stick it out till
cock-crow around daylight—an’ then some.
Pretty fair sleeper, they always called me across
the big pond—crawl out as the last horn was
blowin’, rub my eyes a bit, get aboard my fightin’
crate, an’ step off to knock another Heine pilot
down afore botherin’ ’bout my breakfast—all in a
day’s doings with Gabe Perkiser. Sabbe that,
partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I know you like a book,” Jack told him
with a smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get a bellyfull when you had that confab
with Mr. Adkins?” demanded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m filled up to the brim with all kinds of
material, which by degrees I’ll have to sort out,
keeping only what strikes me as essential,” came
the answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see—sorter separatin’ the chaff from the
wheat,” mused Perk; “an’ if it’s a fair question,
old hoss, which way do we head when we take
off?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You might call it due northeast,” Jack told
him; and then, as his companion uttered a
startled exclamation, as though vastly surprised,
Jack gave a quick glance around as if to make
certain that no one was dogging their footsteps,
after which he lowered his voice almost to a
whisper, to add: “but that would be only for a
<i>blind</i>, in case hostile eyes were watching our
departure from the flying field; for after we’ve
cleared a dozen or more miles we can make a
complete circle, and point the nose of our boat
squarely west!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good boy!” snapped the relieved Perk;
“sounds a heap more like it. You sure did
throw a big scare into me, Jack, ’cause it’d been
’bout settled ’tween us that the game had ought
to be played out there in the boundless waste
spaces around the border.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, everything points that way so far,” he
was assured; “but no more talkie at present,
Perk—we’ll keep bottled up until inside four
walls, where no spy can steal our thunder.
Slim’s knocked the underpinning away from a
bunch of fine schemes looking to his undoing,
simply by finding out what the big game happened
to be, and then bursting the bubble by a
scoop. We don’t intend to dish our business
that way if it can be helped.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wall,” drawled Perk, with his best Yankee
effect, “guess not if we know our stuff, an’ c’n
roll our hoop.”</p>

<p class='c013'>As they walked along toward their hotel Perk
kept up a constant lookout, as though endeavoring
to make some more or less thrilling discovery—never
a man, black or white, did they meet
but that he was made the object of a severe
scrutiny by the suspicious one; however, they
reached their objective without his having run
across any reason for making a decision; and
shortly afterwards they were securely lodged in
their room, the door locked, and a couple of easy
chairs inviting them to take things comfortable,
which they lost no time in doing, being wearied
from so much trotting about—flying men as a
rule not enjoying a reputation for pedestrian
feats.</p>

<p class='c013'>A long and serious confab followed, both
speaking in low tones; Jack on his part explained
the mass of information he had accumulated,
and answered the flood of questions asked
by his comrade, as well as he was able; until he
found a chance to go deeper into things himself
he could not make definite statements concerning
a number of points that were a bit hazy, and
needed confirmation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus the afternoon waned, and the time came
when they were ready to think of the essential
“eats”. Of course it was Perk who brought this
subject up, for he chanced to have a tremendous
appetite, and was apt to give considerable time
to figuring what his next <i>menu</i> would be—indeed,
half the enjoyment in his estimation lay in
thus building air castles along the line of “grub”.</p>

<p class='c013'>Remembering that little episode up in Atlanta,
where some unknown party had made such
a “rat’s nest” of Scotty’s adjoining room, evidently
under a mistaken belief it belonged to
himself and Perk, Jack made sure to carry all
his important papers on his person, properly secured,
so that no deft hand of a sneak thief could
negotiate their abstraction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All ready, partner,” he told Perk, at the time
looking out of the window, holding back the
curtains to see the better who chanced to be
walking along the opposite pavement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never said sweeter words than them, old
boy; I sure was close to faintin’, my tummy
feelin’ like the bottom was adroppin’ out—soup
an’ such soft stuffs, while fillin’ at the time don’t
stay with me any great while—I crave solids
mostly. On your way then, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had marshalled all the facts that had
been placed in his possession, weeded a few out
as worthless, and by the time their discussion
ended had told his companion that the Finger
of Destiny was pointing out their future course
as lying over the almost boundless plains of
Texas, across New Mexico, and deep into Arizona
deserts, to the wild country along the border
not far distant from the spot at which the
Gila river forms a junction with the larger Colorado;
where the latter serves as a watery boundary
line between Arizona and Southeastern California,
with Old Mexico less than thirty miles
distant as the crow flies.</p>

<p class='c013'>It would be a big jump for them, but the flood
of bad currency undoubtedly had its start somewhere
in this hostile region, and spread out like
an open fan, northwest into San Diego and Los
Angeles—northward up to Salt Lake City—and
in the northeast as far as Oklahoma. To
effectually break it up it was necessary that they
go to the fountain head, so as to destroy the very
roots of the noisome poison ivy plant.</p>

<p class='c013'>They spent more than half an hour dining,
and needless to say Perk enjoyed himself to his
heart’s content—who wouldn’t if he had a pocketfull
of ready cash, furnished by a bountiful
Uncle Sam; a bill of fare bristling with all kinds
of tempting dishes such as Perk doted on; and
to complete the combination having been born
with a healthy, unbridled appetite?</p>

<p class='c013'>It was just commencing to get dusk when they
emerged from the restaurant and started back to
the hotel, some two blocks distant. Perk, as
usual, kept turning his head this way and that
very much like a wolf scalp-hunter looking for
his suspicious quarry. Presently he picked at
Jack’s sleeve, and bending his head until his lips
almost touched the other’s ear he observed in a
sibilant whisper!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen, partner—we got a clam doggin’ us
like a bloodhound on the track o’ a runaway nigger
from a convict camp back in Alabam—get
that, do you?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c014'>CHAPTER XI <br /> <br />THE NIGHT ALARM</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“I’m not thrilled by what you say, Perk, because
I’ve been more than half expecting to hear
that discovery. Glad you got on to him okay;
because it’s always best to know what’s in the
wind. What sort of a chap is he like?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack spoke in his usual calm way, and the other
realized he had undoubtedly been prepared for
the sudden news.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ out o’ the way ’bout his looks, far as
I c’n see,” was Perk’s reply; “on’y got a few
squints at the guy; but he’s keepin’ tab o’ our
movements I guess now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Reckon he might be one of those lads in the
Ryan ship that crashed in flames after they’d
flown the coop?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! just can’t be dead sure, partner,”
chuckled Perk; “but there’s somethin’ ’bout his
walk that gets me into believin’ he’s the <i>kiwi</i>
that pilot was keepin’ on our tail so long, stickin’
like a leech from a mud-hole.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder,” the other went on to say, as if
talking to himself; “if that’s the case then, both
those duffers pulled through with their lives, and
not so badly hurt. Honestly I’m a bit glad that’s
so, for up to the present I’ve never had occasion
to take a human life.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk snorted on hearing this.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if so be you’d been ten years older, my
boy, mebbe you’d not be able to say that—chances
are you’d a been mixed up in that mess across the
Atlantic, when Yanks an’ Johnny Rebs were
fightin’ shoulder to shoulder, and it was a case o’
a Heine pilot’s life or our’n. But if you keep
on with Uncle Sam’s service as you’re adoin’
right now, the time’ll come for you to fetch back
a dead man who jest <i>wouldn’t</i> let hisself be captured.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like as not,” remarked Jack; “but there’s no
need of crossing a river till you come to it; so
I’m not taking trouble by the forelock away
ahead of time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’ll we do ’bout this dickey bird that’s
bobbin’ at our heels so gaily, tell me, partner?”
pursued Perk, eagerly, as though in his fighting
heart he was actually hoping his superior would
give the order to turn on their persistent pursuer,
and at least blacken both his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! nothing at all, Perk; let him run his
rope; only we’ll keep along streets where there’s
plenty of company, and be prepared for any sort
of ambush; though I can’t believe he’d be crazy
enough to start anything so early in the evening—if
the hour was close to midnight, things
might be different. There are any number of
tough cases in this old Creole city ready to handle
a sticking game for the coin in it—blacks and
yellows and whites it doesn’t matter which—all
of them are assassins at heart.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then you don’t care if he shadows us straight
to the hotel?” demanded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Much good that will do him.” said Jack with
a light laugh; “the chances are two to one he
already knows where we’ve put up, and has had
some spy dog me to the Federal building. When
the time comes for us to jump off we’ll find a
slick way to hop our ship without giving these
boys a show-down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently they arrived at the hotel entrance,
without any untoward incident arising to mar
the quiet of the evening. Perk cast a parting
glance toward their rear just before entering,
and seeing the shadowy figure hovering not far
away, considered it a part of his duty to place
his thumb to his nose, and wiggle his fingers
derisively, at the same time uttering a snarl like
a bobcat at bay, to express his utter contempt.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once in their room, Jack first of all cast about
as if to decide whether any uninvited guest had
intruded on their preserves while they were absent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything seems to be just as we left it,”
he told his running mate, after making this little
survey, “and even if some busybody did get in
here with the aid of a pass-key borrowed from a
chambermaid, he was shrewd enough not to mess
things up like they did with our friend Scotty
of the air mail bunch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess now they must acome to the conclusion
you keep the letter o’ instructions ’bout your
person,” suggested Perk, wisely, “which, bein’
the case mebbe now they figger on sneakin’ in
here while we’re sound asleep, an’ agoin’ through
your clothes in regulation style. They do tell me
there be sneak thieves right clever in this same
burgh, equal to the ones out in India, where they
c’n steal the sheet from under a sleeper, without
wakin’ him up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I understand that’s really true, partner,” Jack
agreed; “but we’re not going to let them have
half a chance, even if they hired all the crooks
in New Orleans to play the game.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sounds good to me, boss,” Perk declared.
“We’ll manage to sleep with one eye open, an’
if any critter tries to give us the once over, he’ll
wish he’d never been born, that’s all I know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Before turning in, Jack placed a chair so nicely
balanced that in case of the door being ever so
slightly opened it would crash to the floor, making
enough noise to arouse the Seven Sleepers.
Perk grinned at seeing him prepare this “guardian
angel” as he termed it, and lost no time himself
in “hitting the hay.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Some time later in the night, when outside
noises had almost died away, there came a loud
clatter that awoke both the sleepers instantly.
They bounced out on the floor in their pajamas,
with Jack pulling the cord he had attached to
the electric bulb, so that the room was magically
illuminated.</p>

<p class='c013'>The chair lay on its side, and just beyond Perk
could see that their door was partly open; the
key had been left in the lock, but skillful fingers
must have manipulated it by means of
slender-jawed pliers, showing the touch of a professional
thief.</p>

<p class='c013'>Straight toward the door the form of Perk was
projected—a hungry lion could hardly have
made a more pronounced leap at some four-legged
game which he had been stalking.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tearing open the door still wider, Perk thrust
out his head, and looked up and down the hotel
corridor. He fancied he could make out a dim
figure far along the poorly lighted hall, but it
vanished like a phantom even as he stared, evidently
turning some corner.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there were other sounds arising—doors
all along the corridor were opening, and heads
being projected, showing how the startling alarm
had awakened numerous other sleepers, who
may have imagined an earthquake was in process
of occurring, though such a happening was utterly
foreign to the metropolis on the Lower Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c013'>Voices, too, were heard, from both masculine
as well as feminine sources, as the aroused hotel
guests endeavored to fathom the real meaning
of the row.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, seeing there was nothing doing, closed
the door, and locked it again; after which he
turned to his companion who had been watching
his actions with more or less amusement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Consarn his picture,” growled the old fighter;
“he got off scot free; I jest glimpsed him
aturnin’ the first bend down the hall. Blamed
shame I couldn’t come to grips with the yeller
cub—I’d a given a heap to twist his neck
some, you bet I would. Mebbe now I’d otter sit
up the rest o’ the night to make certain, eh,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not the slightest need of such a thing, partner,”
Jack assured him. “I’ll fix that door so it
won’t be opened again in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c013'>With that he again took the stout chair, and
placed it diagonally against the door, so that its
top rested just under the knob; after that had
been accomplished it must needs be a battering-ram
that could burst in on them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not content with that, Jack went to each of
the two windows, thrust out his head to examine
for the second time the face of the outer wall of
the building so as to make sure there was no
ledge wide enough to give a would-be trespasser
foothold.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not the ghost of a chance for the most nimble
thief to get in by way of a window, Perk, so
back to bed we go, and sleep like babes in the
wood for we’re in the third story and far enough
from a fire escape to be secure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk grinned and nodded acquiescence; truth
to tell he was not at all averse to starting all over
again—possibly the rude interruption had disturbed
him just when he was starting to partake
of a royal feast that covered every one of his most
beloved dishes and he was hugging the delusion
to his heart that if given another chance history
might repeat itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>At least there was no further alarm, and the
night passed into oblivion like all its countless
predecessors with the rising sun arousing the
two comrades, and Perk as usual singing out
that he felt as though he could easily manage two
customary breakfasts in that delighful restaurant
where they were already feeling so much at
home.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c014'>CHAPTER XII <br /> <br />PLAYING WITH FIRE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>During the morning Jack took a taxi and paid
another visit to the offices in the government
building where Mr. Adkins had his desk, doing
his daily stunt under the direction of the U. S.
District Attorney and other officials in the service
of Uncle Sam.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, also, had his job laid out for him, which
was to circulate around until he felt positive he
had thrown off any possible spy after which it
was his duty to make certain purchases, following
the list Jack had given him, have them all
sent to the aviation field in charge of the man
Mr. Adkins had placed on guard at the hangar
containing their ship and thus completing the
stock of supplies necessary for their long flight
and survey work.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk carried out his instructions to the letter,
and with great vim, since the fact of their laying
in these stores was a positive indication that
things were coming to pass insuring a speedy
getaway and <i>Action</i> was what had come to be
the greatest asset in life to Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>They met again at noon in their eating place,
where, choosing an isolated corner table they
could discuss their plan of campaign, even while
attending to the wants of the inner man.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk made his report, which the other seemed
to find good, judging from his frequent nods of
acquiescence and when the story had been told
to the last word, Perk felt it was his turn to
learn things.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess now you got the last batch o’ information
from His Nibs, Jack?” he hastened to
ask, expectantly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sure did, partner,” he was told. “A few
scraps of fresh news that’d be likely to interest
us had drifted in since I saw Mr. Adkins last,
which he passed along to me. I’ll sort these
shreds over later, and fix them where they belong.
So far as I can see now they corroborate
what we’ve already been so strongly believing
must be a fact.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which means, I guess, boss, we head west?”
ventured Perk, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Into the setting sun—that’s right, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do we still expect to keep in touch with Mr.
Adkins, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whenever the chance opens up, and we have
any important news to send along or want to
know certain things, perhaps even to call on him
for that bunch of old-time Texas Rangers he
said he could turn over to us if we found any
use for them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be!” said Perk, plainly excited, “I
sure do hope that emergency does bob up, ’cause
I’d give my last Mex dollar to glimpse them
rearin’, tearin’ ole fighters knockin’ spots outen
the bunch o ’lawless ringers Slippery Slim’s
gathered around him. Chances are they’d skip
out like hot fleas soon as they heard the ol’time
battle cry o’ the defenders o’ the Rio Grande in
the days when cattle rustlers raided the ranches
down Texas way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But we’ve got to remember,” cautioned
Jack, “that these chaps are like lean hungry
wolves, that never leave the trail of a wounded
stag as long as they can crawl along. I’m not
fancying we’ve pulled the wool over their eyes
so far and that fact was brought to my attention
just after I got back from conferring with
Mr. Adkins.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As how, boss?” queried the curious Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t just know what influenced me after
I’d entered the hotel, to step back and look out
again,” explained Jack. “There was the driver
of my taxi, the trusty who’d been recommended
by the clerk at the desk, talking earnestly with
an unknown party and even as I watched I saw
him thrust a bank note into the chauffeur’s itching
hand, showing that he has been corrupted
and is in cohoot with our enemies.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! is it so rotten bad as all that, partner?”
bleated the disgusted Perk, “All I c’n
say is I sure do hope it was a nice brand new five-dollar
bill he handed over to the yeller dog, an’
that it’s agoin’ to turn out to be a sample o’ their
bogus money outfit. Serve the slick renegade if
he got hisself pulled in for passin’ a counterfeit
note on some guy that ain’t goin’ to sit by and
take what’s comin’ to him without raisin’ a nice
howl.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t be too vindictive, Perk,” Jack told
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, partner, ever see the boob afore?” the
other demanded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you mean the chap who was pumping my
driver for all that was out, Perk, I can’t say
that I have. He was a flashily dressed man,
with loud clothes that would stamp him as a
gambler, like those who used to travel on these
Mississippi River steamboats in the old days before
the Civil War, fleecing unsuspecting passengers
out of all their money and I haven’t
the least doubt but what he’s a member of the
very gang we’re expecting to round up. Mr.
Adkins told me it was simply amazing the vastness
of the combine Slippery Slim’s managed to
gather around him but he was certain it must
number many scores of workers, all obeying the
orders of the mainspring—crooked Slim Garrabrant.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! the more you keep on tellin’ me them
big stories, Jack, the happier it all makes me
’cause I seem to just know there’s bound to be a
heap o’ rough house stuff croppin’ up, to cool
my blood, ragin’ hot just now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some fine day you’ll be rubbing up against
enough fighting to make you call quits with the
game. Perk, my boy; and it’s just likely to crop
up before long if indications count for anything.
I felt pretty sure from his swagger that
this fellow might be the very same master mind
in charge of that Ryan boat—then, too, when he
walked away he had a little limp, which might
have come from striking the ground so hard
after his chute let him down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Darned pity he didn’t break a leg, or even
his measly ol’ neck, I’d say,” grumbled Perk, one
of his fits of resentment gripping him just then.
“Got no use for these treacherous snakes that
squirm, and worm their way into the confidence
o’ honest gents, on’y to play a low-down trick,
an’ fill their pockets with smackers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s one thing we’ve got to guard
against,” suggested Jack, who seemed to have a
faculty for looking at every side of a picture,
and anticipating troubles that might never have
occurred to others less gifted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As what, partner?” asked Perk, brightening
up once more.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Delay is what they may be hoping for—some
way to hold us here while important news is
carried to headquarters. I can even see how
they might make some sort of ridiculous charge
against us to the police, in hopes we would be
held several days under suspicion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk looked astonished.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But see here, boss, we got our credentials
from Washington to prove we’re in the Secret
Service, an’ sky detectives at that; they jest
wouldn’t dare hold us on some sorter flimsy
charge ’cause that’d get ’em in hard with the
Government, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never know how these affairs may turn
out,” said Jack. “Often there seems to be some
kind of a jealous feeling between States officers
and those of the Government—almost like a little
vendetta, each arm of the Law striking out
at the other, and getting in a sly lick that’s good
for a laugh after hostilities have died down.
These Southern city police might make out
there was a grave charge of abduction or something
like that, compelling them to hold us <i>incommunicado</i>—that
is keep us from intercourse
with the U. S. District Attorney’s office until
several days had elapsed and then setting us
free with a lot of apologies that didn’t mean anything
whatsoever.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! I get your drift partner,” said Perk,
frowning. “We sure can’t afford to spend any
of our valuable time in the hoosgow here, if we
c’n help it. ’Cause things set that way I hope
you get busy an’ fix it so we’ll shake the dust o’
this same burgh off our shoes in a hurry. Got
the date settled yet, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shook hands with, and said goodbye to Mr.
Adkins this morning, Perk and you are at
liberty to figure that out as you please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it’s <i>tonight</i>?” asked the other, looking
well satisfied with such an enticing programme.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wind and weather permitting we’ll clear out
soon after twilight settles down on the city and
the river,” Jack assured his understudy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me, I’m sittin’ pretty, an’ taking things as
they come along, old hoss,” continued Perk.
“Let’s perambulate and attend to the crying
needs of this high noon hour—the girl told me
they expected to have apple dumplings for lunch
today an’ that’s one I’d nominate as bein’ among
my prime favorites—you know I got a <i>few</i> I
really enjoy an’ that’s no lie either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I know a good many on your list—fact
is,” said frank Jack, “if I ran down the whole
menu this noon there’d be only a scant few that’s
missed being called your especial favorites each
in its turn as the wind blew. But just as well
we did all the eating while the chance lasts, for
only a magician can tell what our bill of fare is
going to be during the coming week or two—some
weird dishes most likely—boiled owl,
fried rattlesnake, baked prairie dog—Heaven
knows to what ends we may be reduced.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have a heart, partner, don’t take my healthy
appetite away by mentionin’ them terrible
dishes. ’Member you promised we’d hire a taxi
after lunch, an’ drive all around the city, lampin’
the big sights like the French market, the queer
buryin’ places where holes in thick walls take
the place o’ graves, on ’count o’ there bein’ so
much water in the ground, with the city settin’
so low down, an’ the ol’ Mississippi on one o’
its benders. Then I want to eat Gulf oysters
an’ shrimp at one o’ them cute little stands we
noticed yesterday afternoon; try a reg’lar Creole
dinner tonight at that place Mr. Adkins told us
about—after which I’m all done with Orleans,
an’ ready to pull up stakes for keeps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll keep that to the last, Perk, and go to
the flying field from the eating house by taxi.
From that time on we’ll have to depend on our
own heads and hands to keep us out of difficulties.
But let’s hope we can climb up to a three
thousand foot ceiling, and strike out as if we
were aiming for Savannah or Jacksonville, only
to swing around inside of half an hour, climb
high over the city and river and put for the
Texas border at full speed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This enchanting program gave Perk much
cause for rejoicing and he sat down at their regular
table in the restaurant feeling, as he expressed
it, “happy as a clam at high tide” and
full of little laughs that seemed to gurgle up
from his shoes.</p>

<p class='c013'>They chatted of other happenings, not wishing
to “talk shop” in such a crowded place, lest
listening ears pick up certain information that
could be used greatly to their disadvantage—Perk
had an endless fund of interesting reminiscences
that, told in his inimitable fashion,
were a never failing source of joy to the appreciative
air pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was spent in motoring all
around the most interesting portions of the city,
the obliging Mr. Adkins having made out a list
of subjects they should not miss seeing while on
this first visit to the justly famous Louisiana metropolis.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIII <br /> <br />THE HOP-OFF</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Leaving the hotel, after settling their account,
and still making use of the taxi with its accommodating
driver, Jack and his comrade had
taken what small amount of hand luggage they
possessed along with them, not meaning to come
back again.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins had recommended a small but
unique restaurant run by a buxom French madame,
where they could have a Creole supper,
such as would long haunt their memories as a
genuine treat and it was to this place they ordered
their driver to convey them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both of them felt fairly convinced they had
been shadowed during the afternoon, although
so carefully must this have been accomplished
they had no positive proof to make it what Perk
would term a “dead certainty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They really did have a delightful “feed,” and
the dishes set before them were as a rule complete
mysteries although the obliging madame,
seeing they were tasting her triumphs of the
French <i>chef’s</i> art for the first time, gladly explained
the nature of the food they consumed
with so much gusto.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was fascinated with his supper, and inwardly
vowed that this should not be the last time
he would partake of tasty Creole dishes. This
duty fulfilled, they faced the next progressive
step in their night’s program—making for
the aviation field, and boarding their ship for
a speedy takeoff, their ultimate goal neither of
them could say just where, save that if all went
well they expected to be somewhere along the
California border within the next few days.</p>

<p class='c013'>The taxi was waiting, with the chauffeur on
the alert. He had already been advised of the
fact that they anticipated having some parties
attempt to spy upon them as evening settled
down and on this account he had maintained a
strict watch for troublesome visitors who might
even attempt to threaten him with bodily injury
unless he agreed to enter into their plans for
delaying the flight of the two flyers, as he knew
his passengers to be from what he had been told.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I see our taxi’s still on deck, partner,”
observed Perk, just as if he might have suspected
they would find it missing, with a detail of grim
city police waiting to escort them to the lockup,
they to be held in durance vile until serious
charges against them could be sifted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing came along to bother you, Henri?”
asked Jack of the smiling driver, who laughed
as he said in reply:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I haf seen one beeg hulk of ze man hanging
around, M’sieu, and looking as if he would like
to eat me up but me, I haf been an old soldier
in the Grand Army of France, and I think he did
not like the way I throw my chest out thees way,
and walk as eef I am on guard duty; he did not
address a single word to me, but just a little
while ago he disappear—I think he may haf
gone to get more courage out of ze glass.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good boy, Henri,” said the grinning Perk,
clapping a hand on the stalwart chauffeur’s
shoulder; “for myself I should not like to tackle
you when you have your fighting face all set.
Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So they were off, and heading out in the direction
of the aviation grounds, with the first shadows
of approaching evening gathering around
them. Perk may have been more or less nervous,
in anticipation of something coming to pass that
would seriously cripple their plans for a speedy
flight, since he kept turning his head from side
to side and scrutinizing every one they saw upon
the streets they traversed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Henri maintained a fairly good speed, all the
law would permit, so that few cars passed them
on the road. Perk managed to watch closely,
and never a motor came booming along in their
wake, honking to announce the driver’s intention
to pass by, than he had his eyes glued on the car
and continued to pay strict attention until it
had crept well up ahead.</p>

<p class='c013'>But after all nothing out of the way came to
pass, and eventually they reached the aviation
field where they found lights already in play,
since a delayed air mail ship was hovering over
signaling for better illumination. There was
some small damage in regard to the steering
gear, making it a bit risky to try a landing unless
the field was brilliantly lighted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You made an arrangement with a couple of
the ground force to hang around so as to help
us get the crate out okay, didn’t you, Perk?”
queried Jack, as they drew up close to the particular
hangar where they had seen their plane
placed in quarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, I sure did, Jack,” the other replied.
“Must be they’re over where that crate hanging
overhead means to land—somethin’ wrong mebbe
but they gimme their word to stay around
till we got here—there, I c’n lamp the guys
runnin’ thisaways right now, so it’s okay, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I see them coming,” returned the other,
himself a bit relieved, since the intended departure
was a most important episode in their plans,
and to meet with any sort of a setback would
be most aggravating indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The two mechanicians quickly arrived, the
hanger was unlocked and opened so as to permit
the exit of the ship. First of all both flyers
hastened to don their working togs, then fasten
on the ’chutes with the harness necessary for the
purpose, all working smoothly and finally clapping
their helmets on their heads, with the earflaps
secured to keep things in readiness for any
emergency that might crop up.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being accomplished, Jack gave the word
to have the heavy ship dragged out into the open.
He knew that his assistant would have looked
after everything essential to their comfort during
the coming flight for Perk was one of those
dependable fellows who carry out orders with
machine-like regularity.</p>

<p class='c013'>A few parties had hastened up to see what
was going on but so far as Perk could tell they
were either workers connected with the field, or
else visitors from the city, who had lingered to
watch the landing of the air mail, so as to tell
how it was done when they reached their several
homes, to partake of a late supper.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now the ship had been swung around so as
to head into the west, since the soft evening breeze
was coming from that quarter and everything
seemed in readiness for the take-off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, still surveying his surroundings as if
still cherishing a fragment of his former suspicions
that all might not be as lovely as surface
indications would announce, started to climb
aboard. Jack on his part was handing some
money to the two men, not wishing to leave a
single thing unpaid when passing out from New
Orleans—there was nothing to be done about
their use of the hangar, since Mr. Adkins had
assured him that matter had already been taken
care of, regardless of how long they chose to
linger in the Crescent City.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, too, cast a last glance around, just as he
would have done had he still been with the air
mail service and about to start off on his customary
night flight with the north-bound sacks
of letters and the express matter that vent along.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then he heard Perk give vent to a hurried
exclamation:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get aboard, partner; I guess the measly critters
are acomin’ down on us like hot cakes right
now. Lookit how they start arunnin’ thisaway,
will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did not bother looking, as every second
might be valuable; he climbed aboard with alacrity,
and settled down in his seat; at the same time
calling out to the helpers to stand aside. Then
he pulled the gun, with the motor responding
instantly, so well had Perk done his work when
checking up the ship that morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was still glueing his eyes on the several
figures now racing madly in their general direction,
and waving their arms wildly; no doubt
they had started to shout in addition, but the
descending air mail crate was making more or
less racket, which, added to by their own motor’s
thunder, prevented any one from hearing what
they may have been whooping.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was trembling with an excess of emotion—evidently
they had just escaped “by the
skin of their teeth,” for he felt certain he could
distinguish the uniforms of the police in the
little bunch of runners.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Played your hand just a mite too late, gents!”
Perk was whooping as he in turn waved a mocking
adieu backward; “thought you’d ketch a
weasel asleep, I guess, but not so easy, you gate
crashers. Wow! here we go spinnin’ along like
the wind, and it’s goodnight to the bunch. Huh!
shootin’ at us, air you—jest awastin’ ammunition,
that’s all, boys. Go ’way back an’ sit down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Jack lifted her in an upward fling, and
they were off like a startled hawk!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIV <br /> <br />SKIRTING THE GULF</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There was some shooting going on back there,
for although of course the watchful Perk failed
to catch the sound of discharges of guns, he did
see flash after flash, proclaiming that the police,
under the impression that important criminals
were beating them to it, wished to show
their warlike spirit by such a bombardment.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the flying missiles came anywhere near the
ascending plane that fact was not manifest to the
two occupants of the cockpit; their movements
must have been too speedy for such an attack to
be successful and almost immediately they had
risen beyond the danger line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was feeling vastly relieved, for it would
have been a bad beginning of their special mission
were they detained for days in the Southern
city, while the agents of the great counterfeit
league held the upper hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>He could see with the last glimpse he had of
the aviation field that all this lively accompaniment
to their take-off had created considerable
excitement—people were running back and
forth, like milling cattle when stampeded in a
furious thunder storm and Perk even fancied
there was some sort of a movement as though a
ship would be sent after them in pursuit.</p>

<p class='c013'>That troubled him not a bit, because already
they were leaving the field far in their wake, and
would really be lost in the gathering shadows of
coming night before any pursuit plane left the
ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides, had they not already had one experience
along those lines, and completely worsted
the persistent enemy, sending their boat down in
spirals of flames, with the two occupants forced
to “bail out” in order to save their lives?</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk put that possibility completely out of
his mind and busied himself with more practical
affairs. First of all he was desirous of communicating
with his comrade and to do this
they must have those indispensible head-phones
clapped to their ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was already applying his own pair with a
confidence inspired by frequent applications,
after which he managed to get Jack equipped
with the other pair.</p>

<p class='c013'>Steadily they continued to ascend, and swing
around until they faced the east, following the
plan Jack had outlined to his mate. Not too
high did the pilot urge his craft, since such a
course was apt to bring them in the sunlight
that still lingered along the upper air lanes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, they turned out to be a hot bunch all
right, partner,” was what Perk observed, when
he had the harness adjusted and the ear-phone
means of communication in shape for use.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You reckon they must have fetched the police
out with them, do you, Perk?” demanded the
one at the stick, as he kept an eye on his dials
spread across the black dashboard in front of the
cockpit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! just what they did, old hoss,” returned
the other, vehemently, but accompanying his remark
with a loud chuckle that told of secret
amusement, he being excessively fond of anything
that smacked of a joke; “an’ they kept up
a runnin’ fire at us, let me tell you—could see the
flashes spittin’ like fire crackers on the Fourth
o’ July.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All of which sounds like they must have told
a pretty wild and woolly yarn to the cops, to
make them want us as bad as that, eh, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Makes me think they got an idea this ain’t
goin’ to be just a ordinary man-hunt, but something
worth while; we should worry, Jack.
Mebbe they a’ready see the handwritin’ on the
wall, an’ mean to try an’ upset us in the start,
’fore we get agoin’ full tilt. Notice you’ve gone
an’ headed east, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It may fool them; but whether it does or not,
Perk, such a move’s our proper caper. When
we’ve gone something like ten or fifteen miles
we’ll get on the curve, swing around to the south,
and then when in sight of the gulf turn due west;
after that we’ll be on our way to the place where
our work is waiting for us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! had an idea you’d just climb till out
o’ sight, an’ then cross over the city and river—how
’bout it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too much risk to begin with,” came the ready
reply, showing how Jack always planned ahead;
“you know how a rushing boat can be heard
clearly even when lost to sight among the clouds.
It might be those same smart chaps, backed by
the authority of the police, would commandeer
a ship, and cruise around over the city, so as to
learn if we <i>did</i> come back so as to line out into
the heart of Texas; to make sure such a giveaway
of our plans can’t upset our calculations
we’ll cross the delta of the Mississippi close to
where it joins its muddy waters with the gulf.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you now, partner, an’ let me say I guess
that’s the safest game we c’n play. Time don’t
count anything wuth while with us on this trip
but results are what we crave.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it that time, boy, the Big Boss has
confidence in our being able to fetch home the
bacon, and we’re bound to prove he didn’t make
any mistake in putting us on the job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>All this time they continued to zoom along
like a frightened wild duck, and it was not long
before Jack was turning the nose of his ship
toward the south. The night had not as yet
settled down over the earth, although they were
holding an altitude of several thousand feet and
by straining his eyes a bit Perk was able to distinguish
objects far below—he could tell when
they passed over a large sheet of water, probably
Lake Ponchartrain, with narrower cuts winding
through vast marshes, and seas of waving reeds;
also begin to catch fugitive glimpses of the still
distant Mexican Gulf stretching away to the
mysterious south.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was all deeply interesting to Perk, always
on the lookout for fresh and novel scenes; for as
it happened, thus far in all his wanderings he
had really never looked upon that historical sheet
of salt water; although reading many a rattling
romance of the days when buccaneers and pirates
haunted the sub-tropical waters of that same
gulf, lying in wait for the Spanish galleons laden
with gold bars taken from the prodigally rich
mines of Mexico and Central America.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Perk’s mind those historical personages,
like Blackbeard, and his fellow rovers of the
Black Flag, lent a glamour to the great body of
water that was apt to thrill him through and
through whenever he allowed his gaze to fall
upon its restless surface, and dark secrets of the
past ages.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards their course was again
altered, with the ship swinging into the west. It
would seem to have been something like extreme
caution on Jack’s part but from all accounts, as
well as from their own experience with the desperate
gang that had given Uncle Sam so much
trouble, the scoundrels had a tremendous game
at stage, and were ready to go to any lengths to
protect the profitable conspiracy from being
smashed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Safety before speed” had always been Jack’s
slogan, which could be accounted one of the leading
reasons for the success that had come to him
in the various vocations he had followed—as a
county fair barn-stormer, then in the regular air
mail service, and now finally with the celebrated
Secret Service arm of the Government, entrusted
with one of the most abnormal duties ever given
out to its members.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not too dark for Perk to know when they
were passing over the several outlets to the
mighty river; indeed, he was even able to distinguish
an ocean going steamship heading up
toward the city of New Orleans; for its lights
were plainly in evidence and those who chanced
to be on deck could probably catch the throb of
their motor, since the air was unusually still,
allowing sounds to be heard at great distances,
especially when in the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then finally they left the water behind, and
found themselves passing over great stretches of
sugarcane, and bamboo thickets, with cabins of
the humble blacks in little hamlets, sometimes
villages of the lowlands, where, as Perk plainly
recollected, recent terrible floods had wrought
such damage.</p>

<p class='c013'>So the night wore on, and thus far nothing
had occurred to cause them the slightest worry.
If their cunning enemies suspected them of
planning to go west, and baiting the chief in his
lair, there was nothing as yet to show that they
were making arrangements to intercept the air
adventurers on their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>An hour—two of them passed, and still they
kept making rapid progress. The moon was long
above the eastern horizon, although occasionally
obscured by passing clouds but Perk told himself
it was a pretty fair night, all things considered,
and that he had “no kick coming.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c014'>CHAPTER XV <br /> <br />PERK AS A FIRE-FIGHTER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was not far from midnight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had insisted on taking over the controls,
so that Jack might secure a little rest, possibly
even pick up a few catnaps in addition. They
were at a low altitude, perhaps not more than a
thousand feet up, since the air was a bit cool
higher and it was certain they stood in no
danger from colliding with mountain peaks
while crossing the wide State of Texas, where
nothing save the level plains lay beneath.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was alive to his duties, but this did not
keep him from occasionally stretching his neck,
so as to look over the coaming of the cockpit,
and trying to make out objects that might be
dimly detected on the seemingly limitless plain
below.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a rule next to nothing worth while rewarded
these efforts and really he continued
doing his little stunt from sheer habit, but there
did come a time when he showed sudden interest,
and even half arose from his seat to stare
with increasing intensity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not only that but he immediately banked, to
start circling around a certain point. A minute
afterwards Perk reached out and shook Jack
gently by the shoulder. The ear-phones being
still affixed to their heads, Jack naturally desired
to know what was up, and did his pal wish to
give over the stick to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ doing, partner,” he was told with
emphasis; “but there’s somethin’ queer goin’ on
down yonder, and I’ve swung around so’s to give
it the once over. On your right, Jack, an’ there,
see how it sparks up again, will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say it looks like a fire,” ventured Jack,
after taking a good look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My idea to a fraction, boss!” snapped the
deeply interested Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like it might be breaking out through
the roof of some sort of cabin, or ranch house,”
further suggested Jack, himself now almost as
excited as his running mate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, boy!” declared Perk; “but somehow
I don’t lamp anybody kickin’ around in a
big fuss, ’cause o’ the shack bein’ ablaze; strikes
me either nobody ain’t to home or else they’re
so sound asleep they don’t know what’s goin’ on.
Glory be! if that’s the case, partner, they stand
a mighty good chance o’ bein’ burnt to death in
their beds. What ought we do ’bout it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“First place we’ve just got to rouse ’em up,
and the way to do that is to rush our engine to the
limit, so’s to make a big row—if that doesn’t
wake anybody it’ll only mean they’re away from
home—or else already smothered by the smoke.”
Perk accordingly started up such a racket that
the dreadful roaring noise seemed hoarse enough
to awaken the dead and all the while he kept
swinging around in a continuous circle.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, bending over the side, watched to see if
this had any effect, nor was his discovery long
delayed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That fetched them, Perk—I can see several
moving figures, and they seem to be rushing about
with pails in their hands. If the fire hasn’t got
too strong a start they may be able to throw
enough water to put it out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, couldn’t we do somethin’ more to help
the poor dicks?” cried Perk, ever ready and
willing to assist anybody in trouble, no matter
at what cost or personal risk to himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It mightn’t be a safe thing to attempt a blind
landing,” he was told; but something in Jack’s
voice or manner when he said this encouraged
Perk to go a bit further.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, chances are it’s as level as a barn floor
down there,” he hastened to say, eagerly; “here,
you could take the stick—there never was a better
hand at makin’ a three-point landin’ than
you, partner; me, I might drop a few flares down,
an’ that’d give us a squint o’ the ground. If we
kept to leeward o’ the fire there wouldn’t be any
risk from sparks, don’t you see, Jack? I never
yet had such a fat chance to be a fire-fighter;
let’s go, boy—they need all the help they c’n
get, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The temptation was so great it soon overpowered
Jack’s sense of caution; really he fancied
he would never forgive himself if he allowed
Perk to show a higher sense of duty to people
in distress than he himself could display.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, you win, Perk!” he quickly called
out; “hand over the stick, and get those flares
ready to drop when I give the word.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk started to make a move, showing that he
knew just where the objects of his desire were
located, for he did not have to leave his seat in
order to place his hand upon the small package
of flares.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile Jack had reduced their speed to
a minimum compatible with safety, still continuing
that circular movement. The fire had
by this time assumed sufficient proportions to
dispel any doubts they may have entertained regarding
its true nature, for it was burning at a
lively rate. Jack could see a crouching figure
sprawled on the roof, and apparently emptying
bucket after bucket of water on the greedy flames,
and passing the empties back down the nearby
ladder to some one standing on an upper rung.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was all mighty exciting, and to Jack seemed
like some sort of fetching picture as shown on
the silver screen at the movies—a scene developed
through the skill of a wizard director, aided
by a group of star actors, so as to bring out all
the realistic effects.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get ready, Perk!” he told the other suddenly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All set, partner,” came the inspiring response.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let her go, then!” called out the pilot, just
as he found himself over a point to leeward of the
burning ranch house that he figured would be
the best place to make a landing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had a flare falling almost as the last
words left the lips of the pilot and then both
of them used their eyes to advantage as it neared
the ground, lighting up a small section fairly
well—at least what he thus saw seemed to convince
Jack it would be fairly safe to attempt a
landing, for the ground looked smooth, and free
from outbuildings, corrals, or wire fences.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Drop another, quick as you can!” directed
Jack; then, as this was carried out he started
down, showing the die was cast, come what
would.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk threw a third flare to one side, in the
hope that its light would afford his pilot a chance
to effect one of his really marvelous landings;
which turned out to be sound reasoning on his
part—the shock when their landing gear came in
contact with the ground was not very severe, and
Jack managed so that they did not run more than
thirty feet toward the burning house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus far all was well.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was out of the cockpit like a flash, but
managed to hold his eager spirit in check long
enough to allow his comrade to join him. Then
they hurried over to the building, which they
could now see, thanks to both the moonlight and
the brilliance of the blaze, must be some kind of
a ranch house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Several men who had the appearance of cow
punchers were working for all they were worth,
fetching water from a well, and hurling it where
it was calculated to do the most good.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s give you a hand in that game, neighbors!”
Jack burst out with, as he joined the string,
backed by Perk, and commenced handling
buckets full and buckets empty, with as much
vim as though tested and tried members of a
village fire company.</p>

<p class='c013'>At such a time the addition of two more
willing workers can do considerable toward
smothering a fire, especially when there happens
to be no wind moving; and from the moment of
their arrival things began to take on a better
look as though up to then the fight had been
hovering “on the fence,” as Perk called it, and
the balance being overturned, victory was in
sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was in his glory, and the brisk way in
which he hurried those buckets along was worth
going a long way to witness; Jack never would
forget how proud he felt over the marvelous performance
of his running mate, and how those
encouraging cries, so constantly emitted by Perk,
seemed to enthuse everybody with fresh vim and
go.</p>

<p class='c013'>Finally the last spark was extinguished, and
the house saved, having suffered but scant damage.
Then the men, yes, and women too, gathered
around the pair of aviators who had come
on the scene just in the nick of time, to first of
all arouse the people of the prairie ranch to a
sense of the danger that hovered over their heads,
and finally take chances in effecting what might
have been a rough landing, so as to lend their
material aid to the fire fighters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Surely you will not think of starting off again
till break of day,” the big man with the white
head of hair, evidently the rancher himself, was
saying, while engaged in pumping the hands of
the two who had dropped down from the sky,
as it were, to bring warning of the burning roof,
and start the stiff fight against the greedy flames
that had ended so successfully. “Stay and eat
breakfast with us, strangers; we’d like to know
you both some better, and have a chance to thank
you most heartily.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unfortunately we must be on our way, neighbor,”
Jack told him. “It happens we are on
special duty, and delay might upset certain plans
we are bent on following out. It was just by
sheer accident we discovered the fire, and took
the customary means for attracting attention that
all air pilots employ; but some other day, if we
chance to be in this neighborhood, we’d be
pleased to see more of you all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The women added their voices to the pressing
invitation, but Jack was forced to decline, although
doing so smilingly, since he would have
liked very much to see more of these warm-hearted
stockmen and their wild riders, possibly
picking up some useful knowledge concerning
the way a ranch is run in these modern days, so
different from early times in the cattle country.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is absolutely necessary for us to be going,”
Jack told them all, “if we are lucky enough to
be able to hop-off again. Perk, I wish you’d
take a look over toward the west, and see if the
ground is fairly clear; while I talk for a few
more minutes with our new friends here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was astute enough to avoid giving their
names to any one but the ranchman, who readily
promised not to mention them to a living soul;
he felt heavily indebted to Jack and his chum,
and considered that they knew their business
best—for one thing he felt absolutely certain the
fact of their being in such a hurry had nothing
whatever to do with any unlawful act on their
part—he had as much confidence in them as
though Jack had actually confided the fact of
their being Government Secret Service agents,
bound on a mission fraught with much peril to
life and limb, the prime object of which was to
save honest people from being victimized by a
gang of unprincipled sharks, makers of clever
bank notes that were without the pale of the
law and only base counterfeits, although clever
imitations of the genuine bills.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVI <br /> <br />IN THE GRIP OF THE STORM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Perk soon afterwards showed up, and seemed
so cheerful that it was evident his little scouting
mission had yielded favorable results.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems okay to me, partner!” he burst out
with, as soon as she came along; “course it ain’t
just as smooth as some fields we know but there
ain’t goin’ to be any smart trouble takin’ off, I
guess now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And are we holding the nose of the ship
straight in line of the course you took a squint
at, Perk?” Jack asked, as he prepared to climb
into his seat, the people of the ranch clustering
around, to gaze with wide open eyes at the fleet
aircraft, some of them doubtless seeing such a
modern cloud clipper for the first time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dead ahead, boss, an’ you’ll strike the right
racket, I’m tellin’ you,” came the positive assurance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then jump aboard, comrade, and we’ll put
it to the test,” saying which Jack himself climbed
into the waiting cockpit, to settle down in his
accustomed seat, take a quick glance at his dials
when the small light was turned on, and await
a signal from the other sky traveler that he was
“fixed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The way was clear, and the fact that just then
the gay old moon condescended to poke her smiling
face out from behind a mass of clouds assisted
more or less in giving the pilot some of the
necessary illumination—the rest must be left to
his native sagacity and instinct.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a bunch of cottonwoods at some
little distance ahead, the location of which Perk
had pointed out to his mate before settling down
in his seat but if all went well Jack calculated
to be able to clear them in good shape—did it
seem necessary he could swerve slightly to the
right, and have a clear field for the take-off.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a little shouting as the friendly
plane started to taxi along, but of course this was
smothered by the increasing roar of exhaust and
spinning propeller. Faster and faster they scurried
onward, and then started to rise on an angle
just sufficient to nicely clear the tops of the cottonwoods;
when Jack jazzed his motor, to find
it running as “sweet as a purring cat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So they departed only a short time after making
that landing which humanity had demanded
and in times to come the little episode was
likely to afford both aviators more or less satisfaction,
in that they had “seen their duty and
done it,” as Perk would say in his whimsical
way.</p>

<p class='c013'>As they continued on their way Perk found
himself wondering if this interesting adventure
was destined to be a sample of other equally
thrilling happenings in store for them the further
they dipped into the great game that had been
laid at their door by the powers that be at Washington.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whenever he came to thinking of the audacity
shown by Slippery Slim in virtually defying all
the authority of the Government, Perk would
feel his dander rising as if in great indignation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh!” he at one time told himself, being
rather fond of thus communing, as his thoughts
ran on, “we’ll call <i>his</i> bluff just the same, the
scaly ol’ gila monster, you wait an’ see. Thinks
he’s the whole works, the boss man-handler, does
he, just ’cause he’s outguessed a number o’ the
boys. This time he’s due to find himself up
against guys o’ the right size, who’ll jerk him
down off’n his high perch in a jiffy, or I miss
my ticket.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk kept on boasting in his customary
fashion, possibly to keep his mind on the subject.
Jack was paying little attention to side issues
just then for he knew his pal’s peculiarities, and
short-comings as well and having “exhausted
his boiler” Perk presently lapsed into utter
silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had climbed to a fairly high ceiling, and
caught only occasional fugitive glimpses of the
earth far below, when the moon chanced to break
through the banks of clouds, which intervals
became less and less frequent, Jack noticed.</p>

<p class='c013'>He did not altogether fancy the looks of the
heavens, by degrees becoming more and more
overcast; still, this might after all mean next to
nothing and their business was to keep steadily
on their way as if things were bound to come out
all right.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was now drawing well on toward midnight,
and they had placed hundreds of miles between
the city of their recent stay and themselves. Long
since Perk had taken what proved to be his last
glimpse of the vast gulf as seen far away toward
the south, when the night was brightly illuminated,
with the moon’s silvery rays shining on the
glistening waters, and making a picture that
even appealed to Perk’s rugged nature—after
that all he was able to make out was the monotonous
level plains that lay in every quarter,
as though the whole earth consisted of this same
stock country.</p>

<p class='c013'>No longer were they able to find any cheer in
the company of the moon, for the canopy above,
earlier in the night peopled by a multitude of
bright stars, was now gripped in dense masses
of clouds.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having thus lost his guide marks below, Jack
was compelled to place all dependence upon his
faithful instruments, but this of course was an
old story to one of his experience, so that he did
not do any worrying on that score.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, buried in his own thoughts, and paying
scant heed to what changes were taking place
in the signs of the weather, had no warning until
suddenly there came a dazzling flash, that was
almost instantly succeeded by a tremendous burst
of thunder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ginger pop! that means we’re booked for a
bit o’ storm, mebbe, eh, Jack?” was his startled
exclamation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s hope it turns out to be <i>only</i> a bluster,”
the pilot went on to say, as he turned the nose of
his ship upward, and commenced to climb, evidently
in hopes that by so doing they might get
above those low hanging clouds, and have clear
sailing while the disturbance lasted.</p>

<p class='c013'>When shortly afterwards a second electrical
crash almost stunned them by its violence, Perk
began to fumble for his oilskin coat, which he
was never without when aboard a boat with an
open cockpit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk could take a ducking with as much good
nature as the next fellow but just the same he
did not intend to get soaked if he could help it,
since a continuance of the flight, with a cold wind
likely to follow the rain, would not prove to be
the most delightful experience possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>No sooner had he accomplished the job of
securing his raincoat than he gave Jack the well
known signal that he meant to take over the
stick, and thus allow his comrade to also protect
himself against bad weather.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly both of them were presently thus
equipped, and ready to take whatever might be
in the offing. Meanwhile the ascent was continued
in spasms, for there was always a chance
of getting above such a storm, and avoiding the
worst of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The thunder claps became more frequent, and
also much louder, so that each sudden burst gave
them both a thrill, death seemed so close, for
should their speeding ship chance to attract one
of those dazzling bolts it would be all over for
the daring air adventurers, and no one be the
wiser concerning their taking-off, until possibly
after long months had passed, their bleached
bones might be discovered by some party of
plainsmen out looking for rustlers or seeking to
round up missing stock.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus far not a single drop of rain had fallen,
according to Perk’s calculations but the coming
of the drenching flood could not be much longer
delayed, he felt positive. Had there not been
so much racket around them those keen ears of
his might have detected a rushing sound in the
near distance, like the roar of the incoming tide
on the sandy shores of the gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then it came with a swoop, the wind whistling
around their ears and the rain beating a tattoo
against the fuselage of the ship, as well as striking
them smartly in the face, despite such protection
as their helmets and heavy goggles afforded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack certainly had his hands full in managing
the bobbing, shifting craft, gripped by those
shifty gusts that came with giant force, making
the flyers feel as though they were clinging to a
mere chip tossed about in the wild fury of a
Texas tempest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Time and again did Perk feel as though his
heart had jumped up in his throat, almost choking
him; seasoned veteran at this sort of thing
as he believed himself to be, he could not help
this feeling of helplessness in the hands of the
aroused elements; yet each time Jack managed
to bring their ship through the teeth of the storm
in a way that was next door to miraculous, and
if Perk had up to this time not fully appreciated
the astonishing skill and confidence of his younger
companion while at the controls in an emergency,
he certainly was getting his lesson then and
there, in a way to cause it to sink deep, and stick.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch17' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVII <br /> <br />A FIGHT WELL WON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was no longer possible for the busy pilot to
keep on his course. Every minute of his time
was taken up with a desperate effort to keep
from being thrown into a nose dive, that, unless
miraculously conquered, would be likely to
send them whirling down, to crash from a five
thousand foot ceiling, and thus bring about a
complete writeoff.</p>

<p class='c013'>That however was the least of Jack’s worries—all
he asked was the ability and luck to be
able to fend off threatening disaster; could this
be done successfully in good time they could
pick up all that was lost, and once more continue
their westward flight.</p>

<p class='c013'>The battering they endured was simply tremendous,
and Jack marveled at the ship being
able to withstand such a horrible strain. If
but a single strut gave way under all that pounding
it would mean starting a series of similar
mishaps such as would quickly render them incapable
of keeping aloft; and with this threat
hanging over their heads it can readily be understood
neither of the two could be in a comfortable
frame of mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still it is wonderful how men thus threatened
will continue to carry on, although in an almost
mechanical fashion, doing just the necessary
thing with each change of pace on the part of
the tricky storm, and meeting successfully every
near tragedy as it arises to clutch them in its
grip.</p>

<p class='c013'>No longer did Jack keep on climbing—it
seemed to him that the further the staggering
boat lifted the more dangerous became their
situation for the air was surcharged with electricity
as the zigzag lightning darted from cloud
to cloud, doubling the chances of their frail
craft being struck.</p>

<p class='c013'>In fact it seemed so terrible above that he
lacked the nerve to persist in the upward work,
and even commenced to drop down. Perk
noticing this move, hardly knew what to make
of it. He was, as he himself would have expressed
it, “hanging on by his teeth,” in order
to keep his seat in the wildly plunging airship
and on finding that the bold pilot had given up
hope of finding relief in the upper regions, the
fact appalled him. Could it be Jack had decided
to attempt a landing, with only the glare
of those repeated electrical flashes to serve as
airport lights? That indeed would be next to
admitting their case as hopeless, and that Jack
was taking such desperate chances only as a last
resort.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were zooming along all this time as if
pursued by a jinx and indeed with such weird
accompaniments it would not be hard to believe
the spirit of the storm took on the part of such a
goblin of the air, to pursue relentlessly this bold
invader of the home of the aroused elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk hit the bullseye close to the center when
afterwards, in describing their experience on
this night of the great blow, he vowed they were
“playing dice with death,” since it seemed a bare
chance that they could ever pull through alive.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such is the life of the aviator—one hour sailing
smoothly along, at peace with all mankind,
envying no man his following, and feeling himself
to be on the top of the world—the next and
he may be fighting with might and main the
mad demons of the air, his life hanging in the
balance, his strength ebbing fast, and unless the
little cherub aloft that is said to be watching
over each sailor, whether of the sea or the limitless
air, comes to the rescue, his fate is sealed,
and another modern Argonaut never comes back
again to the home port.</p>

<p class='c013'>It did not seem to be any the less exciting even
when they had succeeded in gaining a much
lower altitude; although possibly the danger
from those thunderbolts might have been somewhat
abated. Perk soon realized that his pilot
had no intention of trying for a landing in the
midst of such a turmoil and confusion, which
fact relieved his harried feelings to some extent.
Indeed, it would have been a mad proceeding,
and almost unheard of, since hardly the slightest
chance offered for the most skillful pilot to
reach the earth without disaster, such as making
a ground loop, and having the heavy engine bury
them under its weight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk endeavored to convince himself that
things were a bit easier since a lower altitude
had been effected but in so doing he feared he
was only deceiving himself—if anything at all
things were even worse,—although the drop
might not be so far, which was small comfort,
since it must mean their complete annihilation
if it befell them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had numerous spasms when he fancied
something was going amiss with their staunch
craft, although unable to decide the exact nature
of the imaginary trouble. Despite all these
chills, which must have been the products of his
excitement, they managed to hold out minute
after minute, which fact gave more or less cause
for renewed hope.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack must indeed be almost completely exhausted,
and yet he refused to give up the controls,
to which his hands seemed glued as though
riveted there. Perk punched his side numbers
of times, but could get no favorable response,
proving that the other deemed it too hazardous
a proceeding to change possession of the stick
while in the whirl of that shrieking gale—which
was indeed only another adaptation of the old
proverb “it is folly to change horses when crossing
a stream.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no means for communication with
each other, even though they may have wished
to do so, since the ear-phones had been discarded
with the donning of their slickers, and
could not be put back in position, owing to the
sudden bursting of the storm, and the necessity
for employing their hands in more useful pursuits.</p>

<p class='c013'>All Perk could do was to hang on, keeping
himself ready to seize hold should his companion
be suddenly compelled to release his grip
through sheer weariness—that, and keeping tabs
of the weather, so as to glean the first favorable
sign that came along, promising a let-up, or at
least a break.</p>

<p class='c013'>Judging from the heavy rain that had come
down in such a solid stream it must be reckoned
one of those dreadful cloud-bursts of which he,
Perk, had so often heard, but which thus far in
his experience he had never met up with. No
doubt rivers would be out of their beds long before
dawn although that angle of the situation
did not interest them in the least, since their
traveling would not be interfered with a particle,
if only the air proved inviting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yes, soon Perk believed he could detect a lessening
of the baffling crosswinds that had been
so trying to the pilot, keeping him continually
on the anxious seat—then, too, it struck him the
floods were growing weaker in the bargain;
which two facts gave poor Perk a feeling akin to
joy in the region of his heart, such as he may
have known on previous occasions, but that must
have been far down in his adventurous past.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to their altimeter they were something
like two thousand feet from the ground,
but of course never the faintest glimpse could
they secure of what lay beneath them, so poor
was the visibility, with all that torrent of water
pouring down as might a mountain cataract.</p>

<p class='c013'>This delightful feeling grew stronger as minutes
passed—at this rate he would soon be able
to influence tired Jack to renounce his frozen
hold on the stick, and turn the handling of the
ship over to his chum.</p>

<p class='c013'>In this frame of mind he again nudged the
other, but in turn received a negative shake of
the head, which meant there was “nothing doing”—in
other words, since the storm still raged,
even though in somewhat diminished violence,
they must not be too premature, and spoil it all
just when the victory seemed about to drop into
their hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>With what Perk hoped would prove to be a
last dying spurt the rain came pelting down,
after which it suddenly stopped as though an
unseen hand away up among the clouds, had
plugged the gap, and kept any more water from
running out—enough was enough, surely, Perk
was telling himself when he made this thrilling
discovery and for one he felt he had had sufficient
rain to last him the balance of that year.</p>

<p class='c013'>So too did the wind start to diminish its force,
also coming from one direction with more constancy—some
relief to Jack, that was certain,
since now he could know just how to steer his
turbulent craft so as to meet the force driving
against it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then what did Perk do but start getting his
ear-phones adjusted, being wild to hear a human
voice, after all that fiendish roaring and howling
kicked up by the raging elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>Why, already the atmosphere had cleared
enough for him to catch faint glimpses of what
lay beneath them—it looked as though they had
come to a stretch of country where the level
prairie had changed into rougher ground, with
deep swales, sometimes running into quite respectable
ravines and there were indications of
ridges ahead, which might even prove to be
fairly high, so that it would have been tempting
Providence had Jack dropped still lower, while
flying blind through all that welter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Talk to me ’bout luck,” the grateful Perk
was saying to himself, “I never ran ’cross anything
like <i>this</i>—they told me Jack must a been
born under a lucky star, an’ now I sure b’lieves
it to be the right stuff they were givin’ me, an’
no taffy either. But that was some fight, take
it from me, fellers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards Jack condescended to give
him the sign that he was willing to pass up the
job; whereat Perk quickly superseded him as
pilot, and saw the other sink back in his cramped
quarters as though unable to hold up his tired
arms a second longer. Apparently the relief
had come not a minute too soon, for he must have
been close to the point of utter exhaustion after
so long and violent a strain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Battered as the crate had been while the gale
lashed them so madly, it had stood up under the
buffeting most amazingly and Perk would
never have occasion to utter anything saving
words of praise for the model and its makers;
it must be as near perfection as aircraft are being
built these days of man’s victory over the
savage forces of the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Setting his course in what he believed to be the
proper direction Perk waited until Jack seemed
fairly well recovered, when he was pleased to
see the other take up his head harness as though
he too felt the necessity for opening up communications
with his running mate, which outlook
gratified Perk immensely.</p>

<p class='c013'>There were many things he wished to have
made clear, and besides, he felt more than curious
to learn what Jack’s next move might turn
out to be—that they had drifted far from their
original course went without saying but a means
must be found to recover the lost ground, after
which they could take up the game again just
where the sudden storm had caused such a diversion.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then the moon peeped out through a
break in the clouds overhead, as though to tell
them it was all over, with decent weather once
more in the offing.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch18' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVIII <br /> <br />THE DESERTED SHACK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Well, that’s somehow I guess over, and I’m
mighty glad,” was the way Perk voiced his feelings,
when the clouds were rolling away, and the
heavenly host of stars backed up the moon in
lighting up the firmament.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Same here,” echoed Jack, still more or less
tired after his energetic battle with the unleashed
elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And strikes me the air’s got some chilly,”
added the other; “I own up I’m shivering to
beat the band right now. Where d’ye figger we
might be, partner—must a lost our course in all
that kettle o’ rain an’ wind, an’ drifted far to
the south, eh, what, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question about it, Perk; I could feel the
pull right along; still, there wasn’t a thing to do
but let the old crate take the reins in her teeth.
Once morning comes we’ll manage somehow to
get a line on our locality, and swing back to our
course.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some hours off yet,” ventured Perk, whose
lips were indeed trembling, as if the chill was
beginning to get in its work—perhaps all that
recent excitement was helping to make him
shiver, as it often will, even in the case of the
most valiant of men.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack noticed this fact, even though he himself
experienced nothing similar, for some reason or
other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Perk, you ought to have a chance
to sit alongside a warm fire and dry off; the rain
must have got under your slicker, and I reckon
now you’re slopping around in water back there.
Something’s <i>got</i> to be done about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! boss, don’t bother ’bout me; I’m a
hard-shell you must know, an’ a little dampness
ain’t agoin’ to do me any harm, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just the same we’ll try and make a landing,”
continued the other, “if there’s half a chance;
all I’d want would be to stack up against a level
stretch of upland, where the drainage had carried
off all that flood.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, that sounds all to the good, boy but
what difference will it make, I want to know?
After such a storm it’s bound to be some cold
even away down here along the Texas-Arizona
line; they call them Northers, jest like I’ve heard
they do down in Florida. Forget it, partner—I’m
a tough guy, an’ ain’t wantin’ to be coddled
like a baby.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just the same I say we’re going to land, if
half a chance shows up,” affirmed the pilot, in
that set way of his. “We’ll find the stuff to build
some sort of fire, Perk, where you could make
a pot of hot coffee; which’d do you more good
than a switch of hard liquor. Put that in your
pipe and smoke it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk remained silent for almost two whole
minutes, during which time no doubt he was
revolving in his mind what Jack had proposed—in
imagination he could almost <i>smell</i> the delicious
aroma of the coffee, boiling so merrily
over the red coals and even feel a joyous sensation
of warmth stealing through his chilled body.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Okay, Jack; you win, hands down. Me for
the coffee every time, to be followed by a quiet
smoke o’ my fav’rite brand o’ tobac. Have your
own way about it, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then get ready to try and make out what
sort of ground we’ll soon be passing over,” added
Jack, as he turned the ship earthward, and slid
down on a long glide, with the motor clamped
shut. “We’ll skim along close enough for you
to get a good idea as to how matters stand, and
yet giving enough distance to keep clear of any
clump of trees, or little bald knobs of rises.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently Perk assured him he could manage
to get fair glimpses at what lay below; at which
Jack again started on an even keel, moving with
as little speed as was compatible with safety.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not very long before the watcher gave
tongue.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Looks good to me down yonder, partner—guess
now we might make a safe an’ sane landin’—’specially
with <i>you</i> at the stick. Circulate
a little bit to the south, brother, ’cause it looks
some better thataways.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This Jack did, and then at another signal from
the observer, he proceeded to drop down with
almost as much confidence as he might have felt
when making a landing on Candler Field, well
lighted, and with every convenience suited to
safety and comfort.</p>

<p class='c013'>His confidence, it seemed, had not been misplaced,
for they effected a very fair contact, all
things considered, even though the landing was
somewhat “joggly and rough” as Perk expressed
it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once the ship came to a stop and both of them
hastened to clamber out of their close quarters—“cribbed,
cabined and confined,” Jack sometimes
liked to say in connection with their limited
cockpit, although his pal always reminded him
of the fact that <i>cabin</i> was something only conspicuous
by its absence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk’s first movement was to start threshing
his arms against his thighs with more or less
vigor, in which he showed good common sense
since there is no better method for stirring up
sluggish circulation after a long period of inaction.
Jack on his part commenced to check
up on certain sections of the undergear, meaning
to make certain he had done no damage in making
connection with the earth under such unfavorable
conditions.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything in ship-shape, I reckon, Perk,”
he announced. “And now let’s make out to find
something in the line of trees, where we might
pick up enough wood for that fire.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Looks kinder like things’d be mighty well
soaked after all that downpour,” affirmed the
shrewd Yankee-Canadian; “so it’d be a tough
job coaxin’ stuff to take fire. But wait a minute,
partner—I didn’t get a chance to tell you that I
spied what looked like an ol’ tumbledown shack
over to windward—I guess now it might be
abandoned, but just the same, partner, we’d be
apt to run across some dry wood inside.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suppose you step over and take a look-in,
Perk,” suggested the other. “I’ll stand by the
crate here, and keep our little glim working, so
you’ll get your bearings when you start back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, Jack,” acceded the lanky one,
always eager for any sort of service; “an’ by the
same token now I’ll tote my gun along—never
c’n tell what sorter game you’ll stack up against
on these here Texas plains, I’m told. I feel like
I could knock over a wolf er two, just to get my
blood to movin’ at a faster clip—how ’bout it,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suit yourself, Perk,” he was told, as Jack
climbed back into the cockpit so as to manipulate
the light he mentioned, and which would prove
sufficient to serve the wanderer as a beacon when
wishing to retrace his steps.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly Perk wandered off, having decided
as to the quarter where he had glimpsed
what looked like an old and lonely shack or
cabin, faintly seen in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>He came back in a short time, bubbling over
with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all right, Jack—just like I guessed, it
turned out to be an ownerless shack but the roof
looks like it might’ve shed the rain, an’ oh! boy!
heaps o’ dry wood inside, with a whoppin’ big
fireplace where you could slap on the biggest
log agoin’. Mebbe I ain’t glad you thought o’
this game. Come along, an’ we’ll fetch the stuff
for a warm snack—coffee, crackers, an’ bacon
in the bargain. Talk to me about luck, it’s comin’
to us in big chunks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! we’ve got to get used to that sort of
thing,” said Jack, in the most matter-of-fact tone
imaginable; “when you’re on such a wonderful
lay as this anything’s likely to happen, and all
kinds of surprises spring out at you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder,” was all Perk could say in reply;
but he lost no time in gathering together such
articles as aluminum coffeepot, skillet, cups, and
such other things as he knew would be needed to
complete their little midnight spread.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon it’s safe for us to leave our crate
off here,” remarked the cautious Jack, “but I’ll
fix things so no busybody can take-off while we’re
away,” which he did without any trouble; after
which they both set out to move along to the
deserted shack Perk had located, lying right
there, just as if a favoring Fate had designed it
for their especial benefit in an emergency, as
the grateful Perk told himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Arriving at the humble shack, that once may
have housed a happy family in days that were
gone, they made use of Jack’s electric torch in
order to gather some dry splinters of wood,
which, heaped above some paper on the open
hearth, soon blazed up, and afforded them an
opportunity to take a look around.</p>

<p class='c013'>Other fuel more lasting was hurriedly added
to the fire, and this done the two air adventurers
took stock of their surroundings. There was
nothing much to see, since the shack happened
to be entirely devoid of any kind of furniture,
even of the most primitive make; but the roof
had stood the ravages of time, and promised to
hold out for years still to come.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk held out his chilled hands to the blaze
but only for a few minutes; apparently the possibility
of brewing some “nectar” was an overpowering
temptation, for presently he started to
work.</p>

<p class='c013'>In short order he had the steam coming out
of the coffee pot spout, and a most delightful
odor permeated the interior of that ancient
shack. When the coffee was ready, Perk poured
some of the amber fluid in both aluminum cups,
and offered Jack one, together with a freshly
opened carton of tempting crackers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goes right to the spot,” the self-made <i>chef</i>
observed, rubbing a hand across his stomach, as
though experiencing the most blissful sensation
there; “best coffee I ever tasted, barrin’ none,
an’ say, I’ve tried it a good many places like
France and Germany, as well as in Turkey too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Same here,” Jack assured him, as he drained
his first cup. “By the way, didn’t you say you’d
fetched some bacon along over here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jest what I did, partner, an’ now I’ve had
my fust swaller o’ coffee I’ll get a move on an’
soon have some o’ the same asizzlin’ in the pan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He started to carry out his words, with the
interested Jack watching his efforts to try and
make the frying pan set evenly on the fire, a feat
that requires considerable knowledge of camp
tactics in order to be successful. After one near
spill, with Perk only saving an upset by quick
work, Jack modestly broke in to give a bit of
advice, not forgetting, however, that old saying
about “too many cooks spoil the broth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too hot to keep hold of the handle looks like,
partner; now if only we were outdoors we might
find stones enough to form some sort of foundation
on three sides of the fire, where you could
rest your pan. Hold on, here’s this old hearth
that was made of some kind of Mexican bricks—adobe
they call them and it looks to me like
some of ’em might be loose. Here, I’ll manage to
pry a few up for you, Perk, old man—just hold—your—horses
and——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did not finish his sentence, and the cook,
glancing up to see what ailed him, found his
pal holding the first adobe in an uplifted hand,
while he was himself staring hard into the cavity
from which it had come, as if he saw something
wonderfully fascinating there!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch19' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIX <br /> <br />FORTUNE KNOCKS AT THE DOOR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“I swan! what’s the matter, partner—my
sakes; is it a <i>rattler</i> you uncovered, I wanter
know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk on his part was already sharing the excitement
of his pal, although apparently from
an entirely different reason. He had already
started to scramble to his knees, being doubtless
bent on taking some aggressive action, when he
saw Jack reach forward and deliberately pluck
some object from the hole under the displaced
adobe fire brick, and hold it up to view.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he saw its nature Perk’s jaw dropped, and
he was the picture of abject astonishment—but
it was far from being any poisonous reptile that
Jack was thus exhibiting with such a grand
flourish; just as though he might be some necromancer
or magician, and drawing all manner of
amazing things out of an apparently empty
stove-pipe hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gosh-a-mighty! that looks like real money!
I swan!” burst from Perk’s lips, as he continued
to stare.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just what it’s supposed to be, Pal Perk,”
said Jack, trying to keep his own voice from
displaying a genuine tremolo—“a neat wad of
it, waiting here for us to drop in and pick it up.
Seems like things might be set up, like tenpins
in the alley, for two lucky dogs to knock down
with a couple of rolled balls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If that don’t beat anything I ever did see,”
continued the astounded Perk, now grinning, as
though the pleasant nature of their find was
commencing to appeal to him. “Jest think o’ a
pair o’ air tramps ahappenin’ along, runnin’
across this here deserted shack, an’ findin’ a fortune
askin’ to be taken care of—don’t it beat the
Dutch what c’n happen—Arabian Night’s adventures
can’t hold a candle to the real thing in
these modern days. Some ol’ miser musta hid
that boodle under the bricks, so’s to keep the
Mex raiders comin’ up over the international
border from gettin’ their itchin’ fingers on it—how
’bout that, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Off color, I’m afraid, Perk,” Jack told him,
after taking a quick look at his wonderful find
in the hearth <i>cache</i>; “that miser story might go
with some but it doesn’t wash with me worth
a red cent. In the first place if this money had
been hidden here by a miser, he’d have taken it
away with him when he cut stick. Then again
it would surely have been partly in hard cash,
like gold eagles, and such stuff—all hoards of
misers, you remember, are made up like that,
Perk, and when you give this the once-over
you’ll also notice how it’s all in bills, mostly
fresh ones at that, as if they hadn’t seen much
circulation, as you might say.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk drew in a long breath, and continued to
stare hard at the object Jack was holding out in
front of him; it might be that something in the
other’s words and manner suggested certain possibilities
that seemed almost too staggering for
poor Perk to digest offhand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gee whittiker jewsharps! Jack—what’s this
you’re hintin’ at, ol’ pal—give it to me easy-like,
so I c’n swaller it—all in bills—mostly
fresh ones at that—not seen much handlin’
around—say, are you tryin’ to tell me they’re
every one five dollar bills,—Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon that’s what they are, Perk, I’d say,
from taking a quick look at the same.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bad currency—counterfeits—bogus stuff, er—what?”
gasped the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look for yourself, and you’ll recognize them
as having been printed from the same plates as
the one we’re carrying with us as a sample of
Slippery Slim’s best work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Je-ru-salem crickets! I’m knocked silly for
a fact,” whimpered Perk; and then, as if mustering
up his vanishing stamina he went on to add:
“but however could they’ve got right there under
that brick—conjurer’s black magic, looks
like to me, partner, it sure does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nonsense! that part of it is easy enough to
figure out,” asserted Jack, as usual very matter-of-fact;
“the only thing that seems to border on
the miraculous is our running across this packet
of all the people in the Far West—it looks to
me as if some sort of Destiny might be handling
the cards—that all we have to do is to keep moving
and everything’s bound to come our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure does seem like a snap, and that’s a fact,”
agreed Perk, calming down a little as he began
to grow more accustomed to the great discovery
that had resulted from their deciding to drop
down, and have a sociable cup of hot coffee;
“but I’ll be danged if I c’n make head or tail
out o’ this happening—now, what under the sun
did anybody want to stick that wad o’ long green
under the same adobes, I’d like to know, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! there might be any number of answers
to that question, Perk; for instance didn’t we
learn that it was the habit of Slim, or one of his
busy bees, to jump across the border every little
while with a load of the flimsy, and dole the stuff
out to a number of agents he has working with
him in this section of the country, also all the
way over to Los Angeles and San Diego?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was the spiel they gave us, for a fact,
boss,” admitted Perk, wagging his head eagerly,
as though he felt certain clever Jack would be
able to figure things out, and hit on some sort of
explanation that would cover these mysterious
happenings.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, this, then, might be one of his hidden
<i>caches</i>—at certain times this unknown agent
hides some <i>real</i> money in such a hole as this, and
comes along another dark night it might be to
pick up the big wad that was left in exchange
for the small one he contributed. And that is
the way the game runs, so I was told.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“By gum! but what grand luck for us to come
in on this deal, Jack—pretty soft, I’d call it,
and neither of us had any hand in it either—just
hit on this little bank by sheer chance! Goin’
to crib the loot, are you, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack scratched his head as though certain
plans were flitting through it, and he must make
a choice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, we have to start somewhere, you understand,
Perk, and it looks like the finger of
Fate might be pointing right at this shack, and
telling us to get busy and pick up a strong clue
that, if followed up, would take us straight to
that hideout Slim’s got across in Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess I see what you mean now, brother,”
ventured Perk, his face lighting up with extreme
joy; for he felt they were already on the track,
and that from that hour there must be rapid
action continuously. “If so be that ’ere critter
that slams out these bills on greenhorns and
come-ons is gettin’ anxious to see what sorter
prize he’s drawn in the lottery, why, he might
jest come along any ol’ time now, since the
storm’s over an’ there’s nawthin’ to hold him up.
Got any idea he’s nigh due here, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shouldn’t be a bit surprised if he walked in
on us any time,” ventured Jack; and then, seeing
the puzzled look on his chum’s rugged face
he went on to add: “I didn’t mention the fact
but while we were making our way over from
the ship I felt certain I glimpsed several far-off
lights, as if they might be in windows of cabins
or houses of some sort. Then, too, I surely did
hear a big dog barking, and something like a
rooster crowing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I’ll be jiggered if you ain’t got sharper
ears than I c’n boast, Jack, ol’ hoss, which ain’t
no lie either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t you believe it, Perk; it just happened
that you were so wrapped up in thinking of that
coffee treat you didn’t pay as much attention to
outside things as I did. So it seems as if there
might be some kind of a village or prairie town
not more than two miles from this abandoned
old shack and if that’s so then the chances are
this agent who’s been working the public for
Slim probably lives there. Then again, like as
not he has a pretty good idea about when his
bunch of kale ought to be placed under that
brick—in fact he might have made his way out
here this very night only for the storm threatening.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, partner,” Perk hastened to say, brimful
of energy, “which, bein’ the case, it’s up to
us to lay a sweet little mantrap, so’s to trip him
by the heels if so be he knocks on our door.
How’ll we fetch it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“First of all we’ll finish our supper, and clean
up here,” came the ready explanation; “he may
smell the odor of coffee and bacon, but then you
might expect this shelter to be used once in a
while by Mexican tramps, or passing cowboys,
especially when a big storm threatens, so that
isn’t going to scare the Johnny. As for us, we’ll
fix things so as to give him a nice little surprise,
by hiding out, after making things all dark inside
here, with water thrown on the fire to
smother the hot coals, after which there’s nothing
to do but take things easy until he shows up—if
he does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sabbe, okay, partner; let’s get busy, for
the bacon’s done brown to a turn.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch20' class='c014'>CHAPTER XX <br /> <br />SPRINGING THE TRAP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There was much that must be done before they
could feel satisfied they had their mantrap arranged.
Jack realized that if the party who
played the part of local agent for the counterfeiter
gang had been kept from coming to secure
the fresh supply of bogus bills by the threatening
storm, he was likely to make his appearance
at almost any time, since all danger from the
electrical disturbance was now past.</p>

<p class='c013'>They finished their little supper without
wasting any more time, after which the matter
of hiding all traces of their presence was taken
up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See if you can find any water outdoors,
Perk,” Jack was saying, as he contemplated the
red embers of their late fire. “Seems to me I
stepped in some sort of a puddle while coming
up to the door. Here’s an old rusty can that
looks as if it’d hold a quantity—I want to dash
it on these coals so as to cool them off. That
done we’ll find some way to hide, and watch developments.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk sized up the situation cleverly enough,
and lost no time in setting about doing as his pal
suggested. When he came back he was carrying
the rusty can, which did leak a trifle, but
then that made no particular difference, so long
as enough water remained to put the fire out.</p>

<p class='c013'>It sizzled, and steamed a bit but Perk distributed
the fluid contents of his can with such
discretion that all this was speedily brought to
a finish, with the last red ember cooled off, leaving
a dead little pile of wood ashes as the only
reminder of their blaze.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now that’s settled, partner,” said the always
ready Perk, “what comes next on our program?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had his hand electric torch in use, for
otherwise they must have been left to grope
around, since the clouds continued to drift past
in clusters, shutting out most of the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We must gather up everything here that
might give us away, for like as not the fellow’ll
fetch some kind of a light along with him—lantern
it may turn out to be, because he knows its
apt to be pretty dark inside the old shack, and
he can’t do much just by fumbling around.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! that’s right, boss,” returned Perk,
commencing to gather up any and all their
scanty belongings, not forgetting that convenient
rifle of his. “But I say, how ’bout the bus—won’t
he lamp the thing settin’ there in the open
an’ ain’t it apt to give him a bad start?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had duly considered that very point in
making up his plans, and was ready to meet the
situation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Taken it all in all, buddy, there’s small danger
of that happening,” he went on to tell Perk.
“First, remember, the ship lies on that side of
the shack away from the spot where I glimpsed
those lights and if he comes along in a direct
line from the town there isn’t one chance in three
of him noticing it. Even if he does I reckon
he’ll feel dead certain only his own messenger’d
be flying in this region—he may never have seen
another crate besides the one sent out by Slippery
Slim.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She sounds good to me, Jack an’ I’m willin’
to take a shy at the target, if so be you guess it’s
straight goods, all wool’n a yard wide. Let’s
go!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly both passed out of the deserted
shack that had proved such a fortunate harbor
for them after the late storm. Jack knew what
they must do in following up the little plan he
had framed, with a view of giving the suspect
the shock of his life and without any further
preliminaries he set about carrying out the few
details.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a chink or two in this further wall,”
he went on to say, in a low voice, next door to a
whisper, “that will furnish us means for keeping
tabs on what’s going on inside. We’ll settle down
there, and just wait. As luck has it that side of
the shack is away from the moon, which is all in
our favor, in fact everything seems to be arranged
just to suit our plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bully set-up, boss, couldn’t be better for a
fact,” agreed the hopeful Perk, who firmly believed
in the element of Luck, and was immensely
gratified to discover how that little god
was working over-time in their favor—according
to his way of thinking it was always “better
to be born lucky than rich.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it?” whispered Jack, after they
had commenced to crouch down in the darkened
spot he had selected.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just great, that’s all,” Perk assured him,
“show me where one o’ them cracks c’n be located,
partner, an’ then I’ll be okay—all
fixed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack obliged by directing his chum’s hand to
an opening, through which it would be easy
enough to keep watch over any happening inside
the shack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Next we’ll creep over to this further corner,
and try to find out when he comes along,”
continued Jack. “From now on, Perk, keep
your tongue between your teeth—no talking, remember,
but if it does seem to be absolutely
necessary, put your lips close to my ear, and
whisper—get that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nuff sed, boss, I’m on,” came faintly from
the figure crouching at Jack’s side, after which
abject silence fell upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>A little later on Perk, now that his hearing
was strained so as to pick up any kind of sound,
however slight, caught the barking of a watchdog;
it seemed to be at a considerable distance
from the shack, and he judged there might be a
couple of miles lying between. This was not a
great amount of ground to cover, if only the inducement
were sufficiently urgent and that fat
packet of enticing bank bills, supposed to be
secreted under the adobes of the old hearth, must
represent an alluring prize, capable of drawing
a chap who was fond of “easy money” out of his
snug home at this unseasonable hour of the
night, and indulging in a little hike, for which
effort he would fancy himself well repaid.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some time passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>They lay there just back of the comer of the
dilapidated and abandoned shack, waiting, listening,
and frequently feeling a little thrill when
some soft sound came stealing to their ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Perk plainly heard what was surely a
low cough, such as might be caused by a sudden
tickling in the throat. Some one was undoubtedly
approaching the spot, and coming from the
west, where they understood the prairie hamlet,
or village, lay at the foot of a small ridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>He merely touched his companion’s right arm
to let Jack know something was in the wind.
The cough was repeated, so that Perk chuckled
softly to himself, as if more than ever convinced
that luck was bent on handing them out further
fat plums.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was already creeping back so as to reach
the spot where those convenient peepholes could
be found and of course Perk imitated his example.
Thus it came about they were in complete
readiness to make good use of their eyes
when a slight scratching sound came from
within, and a tiny flash announced that the newcomer
had struck a match.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk could see him there down on his knees,
and intent on applying his lighted match to the
wick of a lantern he had evidently fetched along
for this very purpose. If Perk could have analyzed
the feeling that possessed him just then he
must have compared it to the exultation of a cat
when about to make a jump upon a sparrow,
close up to which he had managed to hide, all
prepared for the finishing act of the ambush.</p>

<p class='c013'>No sooner had the man succeeded in lighting
his lantern than with eager hands he commenced
lifting the adobe under which Jack had again
artfully placed the bait in the shape of that
tempting packet of bogus notes.</p>

<p class='c013'>How eagerly he pounced on the contents of
his queer <i>cache</i>, all the avariciousness of a miser
handling his hoard was displayed and at the
same time he looked hurriedly from one side to
the other, as though his guilty soul, conscious of
having thus broken the law of his country, was
already seeing the long arm of Justice stretching
out menacingly toward him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack evidently had seen enough to satisfy him
the genuine criminal was in focus, and that there
could be no miscarriage of Justice in effecting
his capture with the goods upon him. He was
creeping toward the open door of the shack, evidently
bent on taking the slick partner of the
counterfeiter chief by surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk lost no time in crawling at his pal’s heels,
bent on having a hand in the closing scene of the
little drama—he wanted to see with his own
eyes just how such a slimy beast would take his
“bump” when he found the meshes of the net
closing around him.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon looking in at the open door.
The man still knelt there on the hard earthen
floor of the shack, and appeared to be nervously
fumbling the sheaf of bills, as though trying to
count them, and be assured that he had received
the full amount to which he was entitled—that
there had been no “holdout” attempted.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps one of them happened to make a
slight sound—either that, or else the man’s guilty
soul caused him to fancy he heard something
for he turned his head. It chanced that the
light of the lantern fell full upon his dark face,
and disclosed the distended eyes filled with terror,
as well as the expression so ghastly that
passed athwart his countenance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put ’em up!” commanded Jack, sharply, in
a voice that would brook no nonsense and as if
mechanically influenced to obey, the wretched
trapped distributor of bad notes raised both
hands, the packet falling to the floor as if his
nerveless fingers could no longer retain their
grip.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and Perk stepped blithely into the
lighted shack, the former with his ready automatic
covering the badly shaken rogue, Perk
trailing his rifle in a suggestive way, as if able
to back his boss up on the slightest provocation.</p>

<p class='c013'>First frisking the other, and removing a gun
from his back pocket, Jack made a motion with
his hand as he set Perk to work.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get the bracelets on him, partner, then we’ll
ask him a few leading questions before we make
up our minds what the next step’ll be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But—hold on, Mister,” whined the poor
devil, all aquiver as he groveled there on his
knees; “I ain’t done nawthin’—this hear ain’t
my stuff—I jest suspicioned Jud he must a had
somethin’ hid out this way, ’case he kep’ comin’
an’ agoin’, so I kim tuh see what it mout be. Now
I knows he must a robbed thet bank over in
Tucson when he went off with a gang he runs
with.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stow that gab,” said the disgusted Perk,
“that’s all too flimsy to wash. We got you to
rights an’ where the hair’s short, an’ you’ll have
a chanct to see what the inside o’ the pen at Atlanta’s
like. This here’s counterfeit long-green,
an’ you knows it, mister,” with which cutting
remark he snapped a pair of steel handcuffs
upon the other’s wrists with the skill only one
accustomed to handling such “safety-first” contraptions
could display, proving that for one of
Slippery Slim’s active lieutenants the show was
indeed over.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch21' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXI <br /> <br />PICKING UP CLUES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>By this time the man whom Uncle Sam’s two
clever sky detectives had trapped, showed signs
of being almost in a state of collapse. Too late
did he realize what a terrible mistake he had
made when yielding to the blandishments of
Slippery Slim Garrabrant, and acting under the
belief that he could defy the law and get away
with it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the big idea, partner,” Perk was asking
after he and Jack had fixed things so there
was no possible chance for their prisoner to
break away, and give them the laugh. “Do we
jump off right now, or wait till mornin’, I’d like
to know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No hurry at all,” was the calm reply, “I
want to go over our crate once more before we
start that hop across to the California border,
I’ve good reason to believe things are okay but
a second overhauling will satisfy me better.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I kinder guess you won’t want me to slip
over to this here town, an’ pick up a few fresh
eggs, eh, boss?” and Perk’s voice actually took
on a wheedling vein as he made this remark
for if there was anything he dearly loved along
the line of “eats” it was those same “fresh eggs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack shook his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hardly think it would be wise,” he observed;
“we don’t know the lay of the land for one thing—it
might be this party has some backing among
his neighbors, and we’d find ourselves in a hornets’
nest before we knew what was what. No,
we can stick it out here the balance of the night,
which is pretty well gone right now, and be off
about sunrise.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a lot more stuff around in here that’d
burn right well,” insinuated Perk; “how ’bout
another bit o’ fire—this night air feels some cool
to me an’ ’sides, we’d have a blaze ready so’s to
boil more coffee ’fore we kick off, eh, what,
partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Please yourself so far as that goes, Perk, I
reckon it wouldn’t feel at all bad to have some
fire, as we must hang out here several hours.
But don’t make any noise if you can help it.
Besides, we ought to keep an eye out for trouble,
no telling what this slick chap might work off
on us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! we’ll one o’ us keep watch off’n on,”
promised Perk, starting without any further delay
to gather some fuel, and get a blaze going.</p>

<p class='c013'>While he was thus engaged Jack took their
prisoner in hand, and commenced to grill him.
There was nothing of the dreaded “third degree”
rough-house measures in what Jack attempted
but he tried to show the man where his best interests
lay.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re in a bad fix, my friend,” Jack told
him: “and unless you come clean, so as to help
us round up the balance of your outfit, you’ll
be certain to get the full penalty the law lays
down. We know a whole lot about Slippery
Slim and his ways, and are dead certain we’re
bound to end up his graft before many more
days pass by. So when you’re answering my
questions don’t try to lie to me, for like as not
I’ll be already acquainted with the facts and
know you’re trying to beat around the bush.
Dangerous business, let me tell you; far better
for you to hold your tongue than deceive me.
Come clean, and I promise you I’ll do everything
in my power to have you let off easy, besides no
one need know you’ve turned State’s evidence.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he started in to put pointed questions,
concerning certain points that were vital to his
plans. Once he caught the man squirming under
the lash, and giving an answer that he very well
knew was like “beating around the bush.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know better than that, my friend,” he
told him sharply, “that’s only half a truth you’ve
given me. Don’t try it again if you know what’s
good for your health, or it’ll be a matter of possibly
ten years before you see your family again.
Stick to the truth, and it may be only a question
of six months you’ll spend at Atlanta behind the
bars. Now tell me again what I wanted to know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He had managed to impress his strong personality
upon the writhing wretch, who was
ready to throw himself unreservedly upon his
mercy and so the answers were given without
hesitation, although in some instances the man
declared he did not know, as he had only once
been across the line and visited Slippery Slim
in his hideout among the Mexican mountains.</p>

<p class='c013'>When Jack realized that he had really pumped
the other dry, he felt he had profited in many
ways and that their sudden determination to
make, a night landing, so as to recover after their
buffeting by the storm, had been a most fortunate
happening indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>For one thing he had learned that the name
of their frightened prisoner was Simeon Hawkins,
and that he had a wife and several children
living in the little prairie town only a few miles
distant—a fact that seemed to give him great
distress, now he found his avaricious dreams
wrecked, and himself in the hands of a couple
of those very same Secret Service detectives
whom the “big boss” had undoubtedly referred
to so contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had been “listening in,” and chuckling
happily whenever he realized his mate had made
some sort of a “ten-strike,” picking up valuable
information that was destined to ultimately
serve their ends wonderfully, and help to “pot
their game.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They sat there for some time, talking in low
tones. The man who lay close by helpless was
silent as a rule, although several times he uttered
a dismal groan, when his feelings overpowered
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess I’ll step out, partner,” remarked Perk
at one time, “an’ slip over to the ship, I’d sure
hate to have some critter do us a bad turn by
meddlin’ with any o’ them dials an’ gadgets.
What I wouldn’t do to <i>him</i> would be a caution,
that’s right.”</p>

<p class='c013'>From the fact that Perk carried his rifle along
with him his meaning was not difficult to understand
and Jack felt sorry for the chap who was
at the other end of the gun sights when his pal
pulled the trigger.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk cautiously approached the grounded
ship, and started when discovering some moving
object just in its shadow. The moon was shining
brightly now, so that it was an easy matter to see
for quite some little distance, although so deceptive
was the light that even sharp-eyed Perk
could hardly have told whether some dark object
seen fifty feet off was a stump or a black dog
sitting there and watching him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Waiting until the object moved again, he discovered
he had been wise to hold his fire, for by
then he had made it out to be some species of
animal. He took several forward steps, whereupon
the beast started to move off, uttering a
little nasty snarl while doing so.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks, on’y a stinkin’ kiote after all, skulkin’
’round to see if he c’n stir up a little grub o’ any
kind. Get out, you varmint!” and he waved his
gun above his head while starting to run forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>This completely demoralized the cowardly
prairie marauder, so that he took to his heels,
and quickly vanished in the near distance. Perk
found everything all right when he gave the
stranded plane “the once over”; and being satisfied
that there was nothing to be feared from a
coyote prowling around in search of a supper or
breakfast, he returned to the shack to report all
well.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was busily engaged making certain notes,
and reading others connected with their present
business, as jotted down in his memorandum
book in a peculiar brand of short-hand all his
own, but which would appear as so much Greek
or Choctaw to any one else.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Better turn in, and get a few winks of sleep,
brother,” he told Perk, who had yawned once or
twice as he sat before the fire. “I’ll wake you up
in about an hour or so when you can take your
turn playing sentinel, until the dawn shows up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just as you say, old hoss,” came the ready
reply; “fact is, I’m a bit drowsy, an’ could get
away with a few winks; but don’t forget to wake
me when the hour’s up, remember.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s all right, partner,” Jack told him,
laughingly; “we’re in this game thirty-thirty,
and you’ll have your turn, depend on it. Now
get busy, and don’t you dare snore above a whisper
either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I do jest gimme a poke, Jack—tryin’ to
break myself o’ that nasty habit but I got to
have help, you know—no feller ain’t wholly responsible
fur what he does when he’s asleep.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In due time Jack aroused the other, and himself
sought a brief period of forgetfulness in
sleep. So the balance of the night passed, and
morning came with a clear sky, and a promise of
decent weather for the continuance of their
flight.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch22' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXII <br /> <br />OVER ARIZONA DESERTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Perk must have dreamed about that hot coffee
treat he had been promising himself, for when
Jack opened his eyes he found his comrade already
watching the bubbling pot, from which
delightful odors were commencing to escape in
the way of steam.</p>

<p class='c013'>They enjoyed quite a decent little breakfast,
what with the ambrosia contained in their aluminum
cups together with some crackers and jam,
after the crisp bacon had been disposed of. Jack
offered some to their prisoner, but the man sadly
shook his head, as if to say he had no appetite
whatever.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was not a bad looking fellow, only with a
weak sort of chin, and evidently built along a
line that could be easily tempted to go wrong if
the inducement were only gilded enough. Jack
felt sorry for him, especially since he had learned
about his family; and was determined to do what
he could so as to get Simeon off, should his information
prove of any value to their cause.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once breakfast was disposed of they all went
over to where the ship lay. By this time Simeon
had found that they really planned to carry him
off with them, a startling fact that added to his
alarm, for apparently he had never been up in
a plane, and a species of stage-fright made him
shake as if he had the ague.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there was no other way to work things,
for should they set him free the chances were
the man, forgetting his promise, would try to
send out some kind of warning to Slippery Slim,
and in the end he and Perk were apt to pay dearly
for their slip-up, perhaps even with their own
lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>When playing such a desperate game with so
canny a lawbreaker it would be the height of
folly to let the dictates of tender hearts turn
them from the path of “safety first,” and Simeon
must continue to “take his medicine,” even
though the innocent ones at home suffered for
his misdeeds—he had never considered others
whom his evil actions had doubtless harmed,
when they found themselves arrested for passing
worthless bills, and how could he expect these
sworn officers of the law to go easy with him
when caught in the act?</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk now began to wonder just how they
would be able to “tote” a third party in the limited
accommodations afforded by the double
cockpit of their ship. It was bound to prove a
tight squeeze, and not so comfortable but then
why grumble on account of a trifle like that,
when Fortune was giving them such a glad hand
all the while?</p>

<p class='c013'>He began to shift things around some while
Jack was busy checking the motor, struts, undergear,
and propeller, with the design of condensing,
and making more room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Funny how you c’n jam things into such a
small compass when you really an’ truly try,”
he told Jack, when he had finished his task. “I
kinder guess I’ll be able to fix him okay, ’cause
he’s no great shakes at size, an’, seems like to
me, he’s shrinkin’ right afore my eyes, he’s that
shaky. Then it’s only for the day, I figger; how
’bout that, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve planned all that out, partner,” he was
told. “As soon as we get over to the California
border we’ll give him in charge of some sheriff
to keep in the hoosgow till we’ve made our killing,
and are ready to deliver the whole batch to
Uncle Sam’s nearest U. S. District Attorney,
at Los Angeles or San Diego. That clear to you,
Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say it was, boss, an’ here’s hopin’ we’ll
get there with both feet when the end shows up,
our prisoners hobbled, an’ with nice new steel
bracelets decoratin’ their wrists. Now to get
the gent aboard the boat, an’ stowed away.
Shucks! he acts like he might be scared out o’ a
year’s growth—some sillies get that way ’bout
goin’ up in a skyscraper the fust time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>His scorn for such a weakling showed in his
face as he helped Simeon to clamber into the
cockpit. The man was as white as a sheet, and
trembling as if expecting to meet with some dire
end in short order, once he left the firm ground
and took to the boundless air. His groans were
heartrending, and Jack felt sorry for the wretch
but for once Perk displayed no signs of sympathy,
it was all so silly in his opinion.</p>

<p class='c013'>He proceeded to take precautions by fastening
the greenhorn in by means of a stout strap which
would prevent his falling out should conditions
necessitate a sudden banking on the part of the
pilot, or a fierce gust of wind cause the ship to
give a unannounced plunge.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All ready, Jack,” announced Perk, after
completing these arrangements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll be with you inside of three minutes,” he
was told, and as the ground ahead had been examined,
and found to be fairly good for the
wheels to trundle over, there seemed to be nothing
more that could be done, only put things to
the test.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was “some rough,” as Perk told himself,
when violently shaken once or twice but they
managed to get up sufficient speed to admit of
Jack lifting her when the right time arrived.
Then they were off, rising like a bird, and almost
immediately opening up the village that nestled
there two miles off, at the foot of the low ridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack headed straight into the west, for that
was their route “as the crow flew.” He cared
not at all that they would pass directly over the
settlement, for few of the people were apt to be
abroad at such an early hour, nor would they
be any the wiser for seeing a plane pass overhead
at such a low altitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, looking down, found himself wondering
which of the modest cottages in line of his vision
chanced to be the home Simeon had spoken of
with such a catch in his voice. The man had
temporarily forgotten about his fears concerning
his own safety, while being carried so high above
the surface of the earth—he was stretching his
neck, and eagerly focussing his staring eyes on
one spot, which evidently held all that he held
dear. Perk ignored his recent sensation of scorn,
and actually felt sorry for the man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor guy,” he was saying under his breath,
though the other could not have heard him had
he shouted at the top of his lungs, on account of
the racket being kicked up by combined motor
and propeller, “he feels right bad ’cause he’s
goin’ off without a chanct to say goodbye. Well,
I on’y hope this will be a lesson to Simeon, an’
he’ll quit playin’ with a buzz-saw, which is the
long arm o’ our Uncle Samuel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon tried his best to keep tabs of the lonely
little hamlet until it was no longer possible to
distinguish objects, owing to the several miles
of distance the speeding plane had covered; then
he fell back in his seat, and let his head drop
on his chest, while his body shook with emotion.
In that dreadful moment he would undoubtedly
have only too gladly given all he had in the wide
world for a chance to undo the wrongs he had
committed in his haste to get rich.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! he orter thought o’ that before, while
the goin’ was good!” was Perk’s comment, who
had seen just such short-sighted men more than
once before in his eventful life, and had a philosophical
mind concerning all such late repentances.
“But I’m sure sorry for them that are
agoin’ to suffer the most—he deserves all he’ll
get, but they’re the innocent ducks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The plane soared along its set course, and as
they were not at more than something like five
thousand feet altitude, Perk could see very well,
when he adjusted the binoculars they carried of
necessity, so as to be able to spy out conditions
before trusting themselves to land, being naturally
a bit suspicious while thus drawing steadily
nearer to what might well be called enemy land.</p>

<p class='c013'>From time to time he found himself gazing
down with considerable curiosity upon scenes
which were mostly foreign to his eyes—he had
only too often scrutinized pictures where uncounted
troops belonging to the enemy were encamped,
or on the march, with monster guns
making the very air quiver with the tumult of
their discharges; where rival pilots came up in
answer to his insulting challenge, to engage him
in deadly combat—he had seen many an unlucky
or less skillful airman go down with his whirling,
blazing coffin, yielding up his life as a tribute
to what he called patriotism—all these and a
multitude of similar thrilling spectacles could
be unrolled in memory as he thus sailed the
azure sky, and saw Jack meet and conquer successive
air pockets lying in wait to give him battle;
and yet this was actually the first time Perk
had ever focussed his gaze upon a genuine cattle
ranch, and saw stock being driven to market,
or it might be mavericks branded; so that he
found himself entranced with the panorama
spread before him as they glided over the prairies
of New Mexico.</p>

<p class='c013'>There cropped up other and like interesting
sights when the wilder sector of country was
reached, with its deep gullies, its bare-topped
mountain peaks—perhaps stretches of desolate
desert where nothing could be seen save billowy
sandy wastes, except possibly patches of yucca,
sage, greasewood, and prickly pear cactus.</p>

<p class='c013'>When, his interest increasing, Perk begged
his comrade to drop down so as to give him a
nearer view of these strange sights, he was able
to increase his knowledge concerning the myriad
of strange sights to be picked up when touring
by air in new territories—now he could make
out the fantastic Joshua trees that seemed to be
engaged in a shimmering dance in the blazing
sunlight; moving shadows that sometimes crossed
the line of his vision he made out to be buzzards
on the wing, circling in search of their carrion
meal; while others on the ground he recognized
as coyotes skulking along, frightened by the sight
and noise coming from far over their heads, and
trying to reach their secret dens in some rocky
canyon or defile.</p>

<p class='c013'>Noon came in due time, with the ship keeping
up its steady grind, and having left hundreds of
miles in its wake.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk began to realize that he had eaten his
breakfast at an unearthly hour, and concluding
that a bite of something, together with a swig of
water from their jug, might go well, he mentioned
the interesting fact that the usual lunch
hour had come, at which Jack nodded his head,
as if to leave all that sort of thing to the discretion
of his trusted pard.</p>

<p class='c013'>So they had a pick-up snack, which was quite
acceptable to the two airmen, able to enjoy their
meals even while cutting capers up among the
clouds. It was another thing to the novice
Simeon, whose appetite had not come back,
though he did manage to swallow a few bites,
and have a drink of cold water to wash things
down. By slow degrees he was getting the upper
hand of his dreadful fears, for while familiarity
could not be said to bring contempt, nevertheless
he was becoming accustomed to the conditions,
and could even display a trace of curiosity
when looking down on some unusually interesting
spectacle to which Perk was pointing so
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>If things continued to exist as they had been
doing all morning it was likely—Jack at one time
told his co-pilot in answer to a question—that
they would be close to the California border by
sunset, or shortly afterwards; since even then
they were well along across Arizona, with fair
skies still beckoning them on their way.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch23' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIII <br /> <br />ON TO THE COLORADO</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Listen, Perk, I’ve got something you should
know—something that hinges on a change of
plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was saying this at a time when, relieved
from the controls he could enter into one of the
little confabs that their use of the ear-phones
allowed. All Perk had to do was to lean forward
and while still handling the stick drink
in whatever his co-pilot chose to say.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! spit it out then, partner,” was his familiar
way of inviting confidence and which
meant so much with those who knew Perk’s peculiar
sayings best.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be sure Simeon Hawkins was sitting close
beside Perk, and what Jack meant to confide in
his running mate could never be intended for
his ears but despite this elbow to elbow touch
there was not the slightest risk of his being able
to pick up a single word, owing to the clamor
kicked up by motor exhaust and propeller.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re going on a bit further than was arranged,”
said Jack, concisely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! meanin’ we don’t pull up when we
strike the border, eh, what, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just that, brother—the going is good, and
we might as well keep moving till we drop down
on the Metropolitan Airport grounds.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whoopee! you mean at Los Angeles, don’t
you, old hoss?” demanded Perk, apparently considerably
surprised by his pal’s bald statement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Righto, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How come, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get this fixed in your noodle,” said the resting
chief pilot—“circumstances often alter cases,
they tell us; well, when we figured on halting at
or near the border, close to the Gila River,
things hadn’t happened such as have hit us since
then.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Meanin’ the storm, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was one thing,” admitted the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Knockin’ us out o’ our reckonin’, like, an’
makin’ us take a forced landin’ on the open
prairie where we run across that flimsy ol’ shack—does
that cover what you mean, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“After a fashion it does,” the other told him,
adding: “like the play of Hamlet, with Hamlet
left out, it falls flat. You omitted the chief reason
for my making this change in plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess you must mean Simeon here, eh
boy?” asked Perk, as if suddenly waking up to
the fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing—what are we going to do with
<i>him</i>, tell me, Perk? It’d be impossible for us
to lug him everywhere we mean to go, flying
across into Mexico, and baiting the wolf in his
own lair, as you might say. He’d be a constant
hindrance to our being free to act besides, we’d
run a fat chance of having him give us away,
just when we thought it was all over but the
shouting.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, Jack—it means you don’t trust his
promises to lend us a helpin’ hand, and goin’
back on his pals—ain’t that the idea?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it,” replied Jack, never bothering
to drop his voice a particle, knowing as he did
that without the aid of those valuable ear-phones
Simeon, humped up against the side of Perk,
could not have caught what was said even
though it had been shouted at the top of his
voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what then, partner?” continued Perk,
apparently still groping in the dark.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing to hinder our tripping right along
till we fetch up at Angeles, when we can find a
way to hand him over to the Federal agents located
there. He’s connected with the big gang
against which Uncle Sam’s declared war to the
knife; and as a material witness, ready to turn
State’s evidence, they’ll be only too well pleased
to hold him <i>incommunicado</i>, so he can’t do a
thing to warn the bunch the big push is on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Okay, Jack. Sounds mighty good to me,
you bet. I’d never a cudgeled my brains enough
to hatch up an idea like that; takes you to think
o’ clever dodges, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then we’ll consider it settled, eh, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just what we will,” came the confident reply.
“’Bout when ought we raise the last beacon
on the road to Angeles, an’ lamp the field
lights at that same Metropolitan Airport?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! if everything goes well, you might call
it along toward midnight,” Jack assured him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got aplenty o’ gas to carry on that far, I’d
guess?” hazarded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s to be hoped so,” said Jack; “because
there’s some mighty tough stretches of country
between the Colorado and the big Pacific city.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! so I understand, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And it would be a bad job for us if we had
to hit the ground where you couldn’t scrape up
a decent landing place with a fine-tooth comb.
When I take the stick again, Perk, maybe you’d
better have a look in, so’s to get tabs on our fuel
tank, and tell me how it stands. From the dial
finger yonder I figure we’ll have a lot more than
enough to see us through.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s right, boss,” affirmed Perk, after casting
a hasty glance at the tell-tale figures so
plainly marked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That settles it then,” with which remark
Jack showed by his actions that further conversation
was needless.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Simeon sat there through it all, never
once dreaming how his fate was being so calmly
settled; doubtless he imagined the consultation
had been about something connected with the
running of the cloud-chaser, and covered facts
such as would have been all Greek to him, even
had he been able to listen in.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was not at all bothered by this change
of plans on the part of the head pilot—it mattered
little when they managed to drop down at
the airport—chances were the ground lights
were kept on full through the whole of each
night, since air mail planes would be apt to
come and go, some of them having been thrown
out of their regular schedules by dense mountain
fogs, or head winds that cut down the customary
speed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, also, was well acquainted with the
courtesy to be encountered at all such well conducted
flying fields, where every one would be
eager to do whatever was possible for the comfort
of those who chose to visit such ports, and
show little or no undo curiosity connected with
the reason for their coming.</p>

<p class='c013'>True, they might turn out to be a bit short
with the “eats;” but Perk, who knew the ways
of his pal so well, felt certain Jack would see to
it they had a chance to “fill up” as soon as they
could strike an open restaurant, of which there
should be no lack in such a wide-open city as
Los Angeles, with its sporty crowds at Hollywood.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was moving on apace, and
there cropped up fresh thrilling sights every little
while, for Perk to stare at through his useful
glasses. They were following the course of
the famous Gila River toward its confluence
with the still better known Colorado, which
hundreds of miles further north passed through
the Grand Canyon country, most majestic in a
panorama sense of any region on the face of the
globe.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along about nightfall they might expect to
pass over Yuma, located close to the junction of
the two rivers. Perk wondered once or twice
why his pal had not decided to land there, and
turn the prisoner over to some one in authority;
but he felt certain Jack had good reasons for
not attempting this.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe, now,” Perk told himself, with Jack
again running the ship, while he attended to
some of his own manifold duties; “he
guessed there might be a bad crowd at Yuma—fellers
apt to be in cahoots with the same
gang o’ daredevils Simeon here was connected
with; and who might even try to effect his escape,
so as to shut his trap—even go so far as to
knife the poor skunk to make sure he didn’t
peach. Oh! yeah, that’s the way Jack looked
at it, bet your boots it must be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Soon afterwards the sun gave notice that it
was about to withdraw behind the line of mountains
lying toward the west. Jack had his bearings,
and expected to be able to pick up the flash
beacons arranged for the convenience of the air
mail corps in their night flights to and from Los
Angeles. So thoroughly has this all been
mapped out, with the signals to be found about
every ten miles, that a pilot can see as many as
three ahead at one time, depending on the altitude
at which he may be flying.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such wise precautions had been taken that
would make night flying just as safe and easy as
during the daytime one thing only cropping up
from time to time to raise trouble, and cause delay
was the presence of the fogs that were apt
to rise from the deep canyons, to blot out those
friendly gleams of flashing light marking the
air mail course from start to finish.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch24' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIV <br /> <br />SIMEON GROWS DESPERATE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was commencing to grow dusk when they
sighted the lights of Yuma, that town on the railroad
leading to Los Angeles. Such a thing as a
plane flying overhead was so common these modern
days as to hardly excite any comment—they
came and went, with seldom anything out of the
usual taking place although not so very far
away, among the mountains, one of the most
dreadful of all air tragedies known to the annals
of flying had taken place, when the great
liner <i>City of San Francisco</i>, lost in a storm,
struck head-on against a rocky cliff, shattering
the ship and causing the death of every one of
those aboard, some seven souls in all.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now they had left Yuma far in their rear, and
Jack was watching to pick up the first flash beacon
on the way to the Coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>The weather continued to favor them, the
heavens being almost devoid of any semblance of
clouds, and the air quite cool at the height they
maintained while heading into the beckoning
west.</p>

<p class='c013'>Over deserts and mountainous stretches they
kept swinging along, to the constant accompaniment
of the customary chorus of a bustling plane
threading the mighty air lanes of the skies. The
silvery stars came out in battalions to sprinkle
the azure heavens like innumerable bright lanterns,
such as could be seen in Old Japan during
carnival times.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was the life, Perk told himself again and
again, sitting there after he had munched his
scanty portion of their meagre supper, Simeon
having again declined to share with them—what
air pilot who has tasted of the joys of such hours
could ever dream of forsaking his vocation, so
long as Fortune allowed him to retain his vision,
hearing, and the faculty for guiding an onrushing
ship through the realms of unlimited space—not
he for one, Perk assured himself, drawing in
huge draughts of the clear air, and watching the
wonderful beacons as they passed them by,
threading the pathway of the stars as it were,
straight toward their distant goal.</p>

<p class='c013'>The night wore on, with the voyagers making
splendid progress.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had made no miscalculation when saying
he believed they would fetch up at their destination
somewhere about the midnight hour; for
it still lacked more or less of that time when in
the near distance they glimpsed lights telling
that the city, and its nearby aviation field, must
be close at hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they found themselves circling over the
port, which, just as Jack had fancied would be
the case, was lighted most brilliantly. Even as
they sighted the field they noted a ship settling
down, evidently an air mail plane that had
been held up by some dense fog belt which they
had fortunately missed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Soft snap I’d call it, droppin’ down with all
them field lights to show the ground, so a feller
c’n see a rock the size o’ a baseball,” was what
the tickled Perk was telling himself while Jack
was proceeding to make the terminal drop, with
several ground attendants hurrying up so as to
lend any assistance needed.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had received his instructions from Jack,
and removed the handcuffs from the wrists of
the prisoner. There was no necessity for letting
everybody know the facts and the sight of a
man wearing steel bracelets, and gripped by an
attendant never fails to excite keen curiosity with
most people and especially would this be the
case if he had just come by the air route from
some unknown and therefore mysterious quarter.</p>

<p class='c013'>He would keep his arm through that of
Simeon, and inform him in a forcible whisper
that should he attempt any “funny business” it
would be at the risk of being shot down without
further warning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack would attend to everything necessary,
such as having their crate stowed away in some
convenient hangar, where it could be recovered
at any time, by paying such charges as were
customary.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be sure Perk was questioned by several of
the men while Jack saw that the ship was being
taken care of but when he chose, Perk could keep
a still tongue in his head and since he paid no
attention to what was said, and never opened his
mouth in the least, possibly they concluded he
must be both deaf and dumb.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk may have chuckled deep down in his
throat when he heard a few of the disgusted
remarks some of the men exchanged concerning
his lack of speech and hearing but
he kept his own counsel; and in the end Jack
came up saying he had secured a taxi to carry
them to a small hotel down in the heart of the
city, recommended by one of the hostlers who
seemed to know what he was talking about.</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon had looked a bit anxious, as though
wondering how their arrival at Los Angeles
would affect his wretched fortunes but he made
no attempt to appeal to the crowd for help.
Undoubtedly he was firmly convinced that the
grim Perk must be a man of his word, and that
any attempt on his part to break away would
prove a most serious matter indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah!” Perk was telling himself under his
breath when he took note of this humble disposition
on the part of Simeon, “Guess now he feels
it’s a heap better to be a live fool than a dead
hero; an’ by jinks I don’t blame the beggar for
thinkin’ thataways either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon all three safely lodged in the
taxi—which fortunately had remained up to this
late hour, the driver hoping to pick up a fare—and
heading for the nearby city.</p>

<p class='c013'>Later on they entered the small hotel, and
found it all the obliging ground attache at the
port had said. Jack registered the party, all of
them under fictitious names, since it paid to exercise
due caution when on the track of big game
just as it would for the big game hunter to make
no sound when advancing upon an enormous
tusker or “rogue” elephant whose spoor he had
been trailing through forest and jungle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Would it be possible for us to have some
supper sent up to our room?” Jack asked the
night clerk who shrugged his shoulders as if
dubious concerning his ability to accommodate
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kindly try to have it done, if double price
will have any effect,” continued Jack, using his
most gracious smile that usually accomplished
his purpose and at that the clerk responded by
saying he would do his best but it was of course
most unusual, and he hoped they would not make
any complaint if the variety was not all they
might wish.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quantity is the chief thing that interests
us,” said Jack; “you see, we have come
by air, and fell short of food while on our way,
so that my two pals here are very near being
starved; so whatever you send make it a fairly
bountiful spread, please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they were shown to their room, which
contained a double bed and a cot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I kinder guess now, partner,” said Perk, after
flashing a glance around the apartment, fronting
on a back lot, though up in the third story of the
building, “you an’ me better share the bed, while
Simeon gets his little nap on the sofy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That goes, Perk,” his comrade told him
“and after we’ve had supper we’ll hit the hay.
After such a broken night as we had back a ways
some sleep ought to be welcome, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! hope we don’t have to wait too tarnel
long for the grub,” Perk was saying, dismally
rubbing his stomach, as if to show how flat it
seemed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack engaged him in conversation of a general
character, just to keep his mind from dwelling
on the subject of eating for once Perk let himself
believe he was in danger of famishing and
he just could not subside but must commence
to marshal all the known dishes of which he was
especially fond, and keep on taunting and tantalizing
himself by stringing them off as might a
glib-tongued waiter in any restaurant.</p>

<p class='c013'>After quite a tiresome wait there was a knock
at the door, which Perk hastened to answer.
Two waiters strode in, bearing trays laden
with a pretty substantial assortment of food—quite
a satisfactory display, Jack thought, considering
the late hour, and that probably the regular
kitchen force must have long ago turned in
or else gone home.</p>

<p class='c013'>The table fairly groaned under the assortment—Perk
pertinently mentioned the fact,
adding that he guessed he’d do his share of
groaning <i>after</i> he had finished his supper which
Jack did not doubt in the least, having a knowledge
concerning the other’s vast appetite, and
unbridled disposition to make a pig of himself
at such times when food was plentiful.</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon Hawkins was coaxed to sit down with
them and as his state of mind seemed to have
improved quite a little, he also partook of food
of which he most certainly was much in need,
having fasted so long and abstemiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>When this ceremony had been carried through
to a finish, the supply of visible victuals had been
wonderfully reduced; and even Perk was heard
to declare he could not eat another bite, which
meant he was like a stuffed turkey, fit for the
Thanksgiving table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before turning in, Perk took occasion to “talk
like a Dutch uncle,” as he termed it, to Simeon,
assuring him he need not be in too upset a state
of mind concerning his future, since Jack had
said he was bound to do all he could to have him
let go, because of what he had confided to them,
and such assistance he would be able to lend the
Government in convicting the head men of the
lawless conspiracy along the counterfeiting line.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other nodded his head as though he
understood that, having embarked in the game
of throwing down Slippery Slim, he realized
there was nothing else for him to do but go
through to the windup.</p>

<p class='c013'>So confiding Perk, thinking things would run
smoothly, took off some of his outer garments,
and rolled into bed, as it afterwards turned out,
happily choosing that side of the same nearest
to the windows of their room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack soon followed, and the last thing he noticed
ere snapping off the light was the humbled
Simeon wrapped in a blanket, and lying there
flat on his back, as though meaning to get what
sleep he could during that fragment of the night
still remaining.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was, so far as appearances went, sound
asleep; but then sometimes things are not just
what they seem. To tell the truth, Perk had
made up his mind ere lying down that he would
“sleep with one eye open,” as he called it, meaning
it was his intention to keep on the alert, ready
to jump out of bed at the least sign of trouble.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps when he thus decided it was with a
hazy idea they might have some sort of unwelcome
visitor during the night; he could not just
decide how this could be but then those unprincipled
agents of the counterfeiter king—like
the fellow who had rifled the belongings of
Scotty, the air mail pilot in Atlanta—were liable
to turn up anywhere, everywhere, when least expected,
and try to manipulate their bold games.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hearing some sort of sound as of a person
moving, Perk suddenly sat straight up in bed,
to see their prisoner in the act of crawling over
the sill of the nearby window, evidently bent on
giving them the slip!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch25' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXV <br /> <br />THE STAGE SET FOR BATTLE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Hey! you, lay off that stuff!” was the way
Perk exploded, even as he made a wild dash
across the floor, and clutched the reckless Simeon
by the arm, dragging him back into the room
by sheer strength.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other struggled but feebly perhaps he
was really horrified at the desperate chances he
had been about to take.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, you must be goofy, Hawkins, to try that
sort o’ game!” Perk went on scornfully,
as the wretched man writhed on the floor where
he had flung him. “Don’t you know it’s two
stories down to the roof o’ that extension; an’
chances are you’d a got a broken neck, or leg,
in the drop. Better make up your mind to take
the medicine an’ stand it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack of course had been aroused at the first
movement of his chum, and sat up in bed watching
the actions of the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Trying to take leg bail, was he, Perk?” he
remarked. “You can hardly blame the poor
dick, come to think of it because he’s rubbing
up against a tough proposition. Better put the
bracelets on him again, and tie his ankles together
he might get loco, and try to jump out
of a window, just to end it all and that would
be too bad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon, utterly cowed and silent, made no resistance
when Perk followed out his pal’s advice.
There were several hours of the night still remaining,
and they might as well secure such
sleep as lay in their power, since no one could
predict what sort of strenuous activity awaited
them in the near future.</p>

<p class='c013'>Came morning, and the two air detectives
were stirring.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another right fine mornin’ for us,” Perk remarked,
blithely, as he looked out of the window,
and made a grimace at seeing what a nasty
drop had awaited the desperate prisoner had he
succeeded in carrying out his plan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! that’s the usual program, I understand,
out here on the Coast,” Jack told him. “Hardly
ever see any rain in this blessed country; that’s
why they have to depend on irrigation for their
crops.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Plenty to keep us hoppin’ today, I kinder
guess, partner, eh, what?” volunteered Perk, as
he started dressing, after removing the stout
cords that had been wrapped about the lower
limbs of the Federal prisoner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never said truer words, boy,” Jack
added “got to settle about this business of having
our friend here held until the gate’s been
crashed, and our scoop put through. Then I
mean to have a good talk with several people in
the Government offices, who can give us a few
points that so far we’ve been missing. You can’t
pick up too much information when aiming to
stack up against smart lads like this Slippery
Slim. He’s got so many eyes on the watch the
chap who expects to corral <i>him</i> must get up right
early in the morning, and pull the wires in a
dozen different directions. I’d a heap rather
overdo the matter of taking precautions than to
let just one ragged end get loose, for a game like
this is only as strong as its weakest link.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do we eat here, or look up a restaurant?”
asked Perk, quite naturally, since it was the
easiest thing in the world for his thoughts to
turn toward the subject of catering to the loud
demands of his stomach, when the usual time
for meals came around.</p>

<p class='c013'>“On the whole I reckon it’d be as well for us
to stick around, and have breakfast fetched up
here,” suggested jack. “I’ll step down presently,
and see if it can be managed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just as you say, partner,” Perk told him,
grinning, to add: “Make her two fried eggs and
a rasher o’ bacon for me; also a big cup o’ coffee
with a stack o’ wheats done brown. Say, you
might add some toast, and an orange, seein’ that
this is California, an’ a feller ought to patronize
the fruit industry when happenin’ to visit the
Coast country. Guess that ought to fill a vacuum
okay, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Leave it to me, Perk, and you’ll never starve
to death I’m a good provider, and Uncle Sam
foots the chuck wagon bill.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When later on two waiters appeared laden
down with a mass of dishes, Perk grinned some
more, and looked quite joyous; for the odor of
coffee and bacon always pleased his sense of smell
as nothing else could.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Simeon had apparently about decided to
make the best of a bad bargain, for he began
sniffing as though the idea of breakfast appealed
to him—he certainly needed something to brace
him up.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along about ten o’clock they prepared to set
out for the offices of the Federal forces in Los
Angeles. Simeon had finally given his word not
to make any further attempt at escape. Jack had
been talking seriously with the fellow ever since
breakfast, trying to squeeze further information
from him, and holding out hope that if he “came
clean” he might yet be allowed to go back to his
family after the Government had made use of
him to send the leaders in the wide flung conspiracy
to prison for long terms.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again a convenient taxi was called upon to
convey the trio to their intended destination.
Both Jack and Perk evinced considerable curiosity
concerning the unfamiliar sights on the
streets. They asked numerous questions of the
driver, who chanced to be a communicative sort
of fellow, and filled them up with information
about the sunny queen city of the Coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not long before Jack’s magical passport,
sanctioned by the Big Boss at Washington,
brought them in contact with several high officials
who apparently had been secretly apprized
of their presence in the West, and had
also been requested to afford the two daring sky
detectives all the assistance possible in carrying
out their plan of campaign.</p>

<p class='c013'>So it came about that Simeon was taken off
their hands, after the story of his capture had
been told. Jack secured a promise that the man
would be lightly dealt with because of the valuable
aid he had already afforded the sleuth-hounds
of the air branch of the Law.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both of them shook hands with the pitiful
looking chap as he was taken away by a marshal
who had been summoned and who would see
that he was kept aloof from all other prisoners
until his testimony was wanted in court.</p>

<p class='c013'>After that they fell into a general talk, Jack
telling the deeply interested officials about the
stirring adventures befalling himself and Perk
since they first struck Atlanta, where the drive
really had its beginning.</p>

<p class='c013'>In return he was given such information as
had been gathered in connection with more recent
happenings along the line of Slippery Slim’s
operations and the fact of the matter was there
always seemed to be fresh outbreaks of the bogus
money disease in this or that part of the whole
Southwest, as new agents started to work virgin
territory until by this time the greatest unrest
and uneasiness existed among all Government
ranks.</p>

<p class='c013'>The balance of that day the two pals put in
taking a look around the city, visiting Hollywood,
and seeing a number of movie stars whom
they recognized from familiarity with their faces
on the silver screen at various times.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack paid another visit to Federal Headquarters
on the succeeding day, to gather up all
loose ends, and decide on his plans while Perk
took himself off to look up some old friend, who,
he understood, was making good in one of the
new big pictures.</p>

<p class='c013'>They met again late in the afternoon, with
Perk displaying signs of nervous tension for
almost the first thing he said to his chum was in
the shape of a leading question, which Jack undoubtedly
anticipated, knowing Perk’s headlong
nature as he did, and the habit of the other for
seeking speedy action.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wal, what’s the good word, old hoss—when
do we skip out from here, if so be it’s all set?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No more hanging fire, brother,” Jack assured
him, smilingly “we’re loaded for bear this time,
sure pop. I’ve been out at the airport, and had
a full tank of gas put aboard the crate as well
as all that stuff you sent over so’s to keep us from,
starving to death.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bully boy!” crowed the delighted Perk; “jest
can’t come any too soon to please me. I’m only
cravin’ a chanct for a set-to with the head o’ this
flim-flam bunch, who’s laughed at the Government
boys just once too often. Is it tonight,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Midnight ought to see us several hundred
miles on our way, if all goes well,” Jack told
him, not displaying any outward signs of jubilation
himself, although he undoubtedly must be
thrilled by the thought of how they were now
about to put everything to the test, and match
their wits against that astute schemer, for whom
the Federal prison doors were yawning so widely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never gimme sweeter words, old pal!”
Perk was saying, backed up by one of his most
hideous grins.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch26' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVI <br /> <br />ON THE FACE OF THE MOON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Jack proved as good as his word, for they were
off shortly after nightfall, and headed almost
due east. No one at the aviation field had the
remotest idea as to who they were, what their
destination might be, and whence they came.
But then this particular port was becoming a
very important link in the trans-continental
chain, with lines of great passenger and freight
airships going and coming not to mention the
several speedy air mail boats that covered their
hundreds of miles day or night and as a rule on a
schedule that seemed as perfect as that of any
train time table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was unusually silent, at least for him.
Perhaps he was realizing at last the serious
nature of the job they had undertaken—that it
was rather a weighty proposition, such as was
bound to require all their united reserve force
to put across.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still, he had absolute confidence in Jack’s
ability to swing the undertaking, and also refused
to allow anything like doubt to assail him
with regard to their united courage.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was by this time well understood that the
climax, when it came, would occur on Mexican
soil for now that all accounts from every quarter
were in hand, they knew absolutely that the den
of the counterfeiting gang was in a secret cave
among the mountains of Sonora also that the
sagacious Slim had bought protection from certain
local Mexican officials, who were suspected
of secretly plotting a new revolution, and took
this means for obtaining the money needed to
purchase arms in the States.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was even said that Slim never flew back to
his headquarters without loading his swift plane
with a dead weight of guns and ammunition as
the price he had to pay for being allowed to operate
undisturbed on foreign soil.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A pretty kettle of fish, I’d call that sort o’
game,” Perk had indignantly asserted, when he
learned of this see-saw method of currying favor
with the plotting generals who hoped to once
again turn the country upside-down and kick
the present rulers out of office, as well as seize
the city banks with their rich booty.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so it was, but Jack realized how it accounted
for the long spell of immunity Slim had
enjoyed while he lined his pockets, and spread
that financial panic throughout the Southwestern
States. There never had been his equal as a skillful
worker and bold lawbreaker; one who knew
how to set neighbor against neighbor, and make
every one work so that he could rake off a heavy
dividend from each separate deal.</p>

<p class='c013'>So he had for a long time been coming and
going, crossing the border, as a rule by the air
route, carrying his cargoes of deceitful bank bills
to various distributing points—like the one Jack
and Perk had struck by sheer accident—gathering
the genuine stuff contributed by his numerous
dupes, and leaving bulky packages of the wonderfully
executed spurious notes in exchange.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a veritable Golconda for the industrious
worker, who, safe from interference, had kept
as busy as the proverbial bee, that stores honey
day after day.</p>

<p class='c013'>They followed the line of swirling beacons
the air mail boys were in the habit of trailing,
since by this means they could pass some of the
numerous danger spots on their route. In good
time Jack expected to turn his back on these
friendly flashing lights and head due south, to
cross the border, and fly over foreign territory.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had been placed in possession of certain
secret documents issued by the Mexican government,
which proved how they knew of the unholy
alliance made between Slim, the counterfeiter
king, and those traitorous generals who yearned
for fresh outbreaks so as to pamper their own
personal fortunes, just then at low ebb.</p>

<p class='c013'>There existed something of an arrangement,
whereby the Mexican government agreed to
stand back of any effort made by the Department
at Washington to capture Slim, smash his gang
that was widening its powers every day, and
clean out the mess of near-bandits with whom he
had allied himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>If it were necessary all arrangements had been
made whereby Colonel Jose Morales, with a
crack regiment of hard fighting regulars who
had seen much bloody service in bringing the
defiant Yaqui Indians to terms by invading their
mountain fastnesses, and meeting them hand-to-hand—was
stationed within a day’s ride of the
ravine where Slim had his plant and could be
summoned by means of certain smoke signals.
No sooner would these “talking smokes” be detected
than the order would be given “boots and
saddles,” with the mounted regiment in full
swing for the debatable ground where Slim had
his nefarious nest.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, too, had a secret arrangement been effected
with the old leader of the now defunct Texas
Rangers, most of whom were in the service of the
Government connected with the border patrol
and orders had been given the former gallant
hero that if a certain message were received, no
matter by what method, he was to gather a squad
of his old fighters, and cross the border, sure of
being warmly received by the loyal Mexican
troops who would welcome his assistance in wiping
out the sore spot that had been so long a blot
on their country’s honor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus it would seem that everything possible
had been done toward striking a telling blow.
It only remained for Jack Ralston to start the
ball rolling, when it must gain fresh impetus
with every revolution.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk acted as though decidedly pleased when
later on he discovered that they no longer followed
the flashing beacon trail—Jack had gone
as far as was judicious along that line and now
headed straight into the mysterious south, toward
the border of the neighboring republic where
disorder still held sway, and disgruntled chiefs
continued to plot against the rule of the recently
elected president.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every mile traversed now was bringing them
closer to their goal, and Perk found more or less
joy in picturing the thrilling climax, when they
would give Slippery Slim the surprise of his
life—if only no leak concerning their clever plan
had come about.</p>

<p class='c013'>The moon had risen, and was hanging there
in the east, a silvery shield with one edge clipped
off telling that the queen of the night was already
well past her “full” stage and running for
a fall.</p>

<p class='c013'>All at once Perk had an electric shock.</p>

<p class='c013'>He leaned convulsively forward and gripped
his mate by the shoulder, at the same time pointing
toward the southeast and shouting through
the head phones:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look, oh look—see what’s passing across the
moon, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then just as suddenly did he release his clutch,
to fall back in his seat, and exclaim most dramatically,
with a touch of disgust in his voice:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! It’s slipped past, dang the luck!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But I got it all right, Perk,” the pilot assured
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it <i>was</i> a ship, an’ my lamps didn’t fool
me, partner?” Perk cried in renewed excitement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As sure as you’re born, that’s what it was,
brother,” Jack added.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Headin’ south, same as we’re doin’ right now,
eh, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, buddy—just what the crate was
doing, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the answer—could it a been <i>him</i>, on
his way back home with a load o’ machine guns,
life they say he carries every time he crosses the
border, after takin’ out a freshly printed batch
o’ his flimsy stuff to soak on the honest folks back
home?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s something we can only make a stab
at,” replied Jack. “Chances lean that, way, I
must say; but just the same it might have been
some mail plane that’s got blown off its regular
course, and is beating it for the home port. Then
again I understand the border patrol are handling
a few ships in their line of intercepting flyers
making a business of smuggling Chinese aliens
across the line night-times.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d give a heap to know the answer to that
puzzle,” continued Perk, who disliked enigmas,
and all that sort of thing calculated to make a
fellow lie awake nights, bothering his poor
brains. He never had been fitted by Nature for
the job of being a real detective.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll never know,” his pal told him, “unless
it happens we run afoul of the other crate when
our courses draw closer together and if it’s Slim
whose fingers grip that stick we’d rather be excused
for having that happen—our job is to fetch
him back <i>alive</i>, and not make him lose his life
in a crash.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me, I ain’t peticular just what <i>does</i> happen
to the slick guy,” Perk wound up the little talkfest
by saying. “Only, when it comes to a real
showdown either Slim or us got to go to the
wall—dead or alive, the thing’s goin’ to be settled
for keeps!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch27' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVII <br /> <br />THE SIERRA MADRE CHAIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Another thing Perk noticed—this was the fact
that Jack seemed to have changed his mind with
regard to making haste for the ship was racing
along at top-notch speed, as though engaged
in a race with some unseen rival.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hey! what’s the big idea, Jack?” he called
out, when this thing had been going on for some
time, and his burning curiosity could no longer
be held in leash. “Why doin’ the sprintin’ act,
I’m awonderin’?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Less chance for us to run foul of that other
boat if we forge well ahead, don’t you see, partner?”
exclaimed the pilot, sententiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! that’s a fact,” returned the enlightened
Perk. “An’ then mebbe it’d be jest as well for us
to get there ahead o’ the boss in the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m aiming to do that,” he was told.
“It happens that we can’t keep on in the boat till
we strike close to his hideout—the racket would
stir the whole bunch up like a hornet’s nest you’ve
kicked when going through the brush, with the
mad critters swarming out to tackle you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you now, Big Boss—never did think
o’ that before. Then I kinder guess we’ll
have to hike some little way,” and there was a
vein of chagrin in the speaker’s voice as he mentioned
this fact, since walking and Perk never
did seem to agree very well—like most flyers he
had been spoiled for all manner of pedestrianism
by his ability to cover such vast distances
without moving his pedal extremities an iota.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s our sure enough program,” Jack told
him, doubtless thinking that the delayed knowledge
might allow his pal to make up his mind
about swallowing the bitter medicine without a
single grimace.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not long after this little break when
Jack again spoke:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve a good idea we’re across the line now,
partner,” was the information he passed along.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sounds good to me, okay,” commented Perk,
with a tinge of solid satisfaction visible in his
voice as though having a possible rough-house
job to handle, the sooner he got busy the sooner
it was likely to be over.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And making more than an even hundred
miles to the hour in the bargain, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some punkins about comin’ in swell on the
last lap, this crate sure is, I’d say, partner.
Licketty split she humps along like a reg’lar
witch. I guess now she’d make rings around
that ol’ boat Slim’s got hold o’ though it
answers his purpose seems like. But see here,
Jack, you never did tell me jest how you got word
to that same Colonel Morales down here in
Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was given my instructions, and sent a telegram
to him at Hermosilla, in care of Padre
Lopez, giving him the order he was expecting—during
the last hour we were in Los Angeles.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! then the sojers must be in the saddle
right now!” burst out Perk, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If the arrangement went through without a
miss that’s like enough a fact,” admitted Jack;
“the way my plan’s arranged everything must go
off with the regularity of machine work, each
separate part dovetailing, so as to work in full
sympathy. If anything lags, and goes amiss, it’s
apt to throw the whole scheme out of gear, you
understand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! I grab what you mean, partner,” said
the astounded Perk; “but I got to hand it to you
when it comes to hatchin’ up big things—it’s jest
wonderful how you manage. An’ I sure do hope
everything’ll slide along like greased lightnin’,
once it gets started.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had planned to drop down in some isolated
spot where with the coming of dawn, with
the aid of the strong glasses they could pick up
the rocky Sierra Madre range with its canyons
and valleys, where, unless all his leads have been
false clues, those whom they sought would have
their secret den and stronghold.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk got to thinking these matters over, and of
course he was bound to run across some things
that still seemed a bit hazy in his mind. Accordingly
he sought for information at headquarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, now, d’ye know I’m jest beginnin’ to get
on to why you had the wings an’ fuselage o’ this
here ship painted the color o’ sand—took a pattern
from the way they striped the steamers on
the Atlantic durin’ the big war, an’ colored batteries
on the battle front, so flyers couldn’t pick
’em out to drop their bombs down on—camouflage,
ain’t that the right word, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Slow to get on to my little schemes, partner;
but in the end you make a smart stab—yes, that
was what I had in mind, for I knew we’d have
to park the old bus somewhere in the open; and
I didn’t want any hostile eye to glimpse her from
a soaring plane, or a mountain crag—for you see
I reckoned Slim was too smart a lad not to have
binoculars handy so as to watch for trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>More than ever was Perk impressed with an
overwhelming admiration for the ability of his
pal to lay plans capable of covering every possible
necessity that could arise in carrying out
the job they had tackled.</p>

<p class='c013'>He asked no more questions, confident that
everything was bound to move along smoothly,
when the casting of the play was in such capable
hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Anyway,” he told himself as he thus pondered,
“we ain’t seen anything more o’ that moon
ship, which makes it certain we’ve knocked her
outen the runnin’. Wonder now if that was really
an’ truly ol’ Slim, totin’ a swell bunch o’ machine
guns, so’s to bolster up the new revolution
they say is bein’ fostered an’ nursed in this corner
o’ poor ol’ Mexico. Queer what international
jingles a feller c’n get mixed up in, when he runs
in harness with Uncle Sam’s revenue boys; but
it’s all pie to me, just the same, ’cause they allers
did say my middle name was Scrap.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was now starting to make use of the binoculars,
which were fitted with lens capable of
making them useful during the night-time, at
least when there was a certain amount of moonlight.
In a general way Perk could decide where
to turn his attention, for it went without saying
that the mountain chain lay toward the southeast
for had he not studied the lay of the land
upon the small but accurate map with which
Jack had armed himself before leaving Washington
to take up this hazardous adventure?</p>

<p class='c013'>When he felt assured that he could make out
the distant ridges he announced his pleasing discovery
to his mate and then at the other’s request
took over the controls so that Jack in turn might
use the glasses and thus make assurance doubly
safe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bank, and head more into the east,” Perk
heard the other saying, after a steady look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it’s the Sierra Madre okay, partner, I
opine?” suggested the one at the stick, as he
obeyed orders.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question about it,” Jack assured him “but
I knew it was time for us to sight the ridge. I’ve
pored over the map of this section, and charted
it all out in blocks, so I can tell just what the lay
of the land is, and how long it’s apt to take the
colonel to get here with his galloping company.
We’re going to drop down presently, and find
shelter where we can lie low until the hour comes
for making our ten strike.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How long might that be, boss?” asked Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It all depends on certain happenings. We
can creep up close to the place, and watch how
things move figuring out how to act when you
get your first glimpse of a dust cloud away off
toward where Hermosilla lies. I give the cavalry
two days to reach here, if everything moves along
smoothly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Two long days—an’ say, we gotter eat all that
time, don’t we, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We surely can’t live on air, Perk; but I’ve
provided for that—even should we run out of
grub you laid in I’ve a little deposit of dried
meat, real pemmican in fact, that will keep us
from famishing. Water we can secure somewhere
among the mountain trails, since never a
drop would we be apt to find on the open desert.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! I’m leavin’ it all to you, Big Boss,”
Perk told him, again lost in wonder and near
awe as he realized how Jack seemed to have
thought of everything—what a mind the boy had
for grasping details, and weaving them into the
net with which they expected to enmesh the slippery
one.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now Jack slowed down their speed more or
less, although of course it was not possible to
soften the clamor accompanying their flight
through space. But Perk noticed that, so far as
he could tell, the night wind was coming from
ahead, and this assured him it would not be apt
to carry those telltale sounds toward the range
lying in the east, and so warn the enemy of their
coming.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch28' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVIII <br /> <br />CLOSE TO THE TIGER’S LAIR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“We’re about due for a landing, Perk,” finally
announced the pilot, after he had used the glasses
for a spell, and again took over the stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! some hike that’s agoin’ to be, I’d say,
old hoss,” grunted Perk; “but I guess it can’t
be helped—got to take the bitter with the sweet
lots o’ times—the way o’ the world, seems like.
Go to it then, boss; if anybody c’n make a safe
landin’ by moonlight it’s jest you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>His confidence was not misplaced, as Jack
proved when he brought the ship down in as
perfect a three-point drop as the best of aces
could have carried out.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’ll have to lie here till we need her again,”
he observed, on climbing out of his confined
quarters, and stretching his cramped legs after
the manner of air mail pilots in from a long and
irksome run.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk stared around him—they were on the
sandy desert without a doubt, and off toward the
east could be seen the dim crests of the high and
ragged peaks comprising the main ridges of the
Sierra Madres—old-time home of the fierce
Yaqui Indians, whom the soldiers of Mexico had
for so many years labored so hard and in vain
to conquer; nor was it until the day the airplane
came along that they were able to accomplish
this much to be desired end.</p>

<p class='c013'>But now other equally annoying thorns in the
flesh had made a hideout of those same
inaccessible mountains—defeated aspirants for
the presidency of the Republic, always generals,
took to gathering groups of malcontents and mercenary
adventurers in these mountain depths,
defying the troops sent to rout them out, and
proving the latest source of trouble in the political
problems of the authorities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack soon completed his preparations for
abandoning their ship. He looked it all over, to
satisfy himself its camouflage would prevent it
from being sighted by any air pilot chancing to
pass overhead at a reasonable altitude then he
gathered a few articles, the possession of which
might turn out to be of value when it came to
closing the mouth of the bag and finally announced
himself as ready to make a move.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got all you wanted, Perk?” he inquired, incidentally,
for he had reason to feel certain such
was the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! from the binoculars an’ my rifle, down
to what’s left o’ the eats,” the other assured him.
“Guess we’ll get along somehow or other.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! don’t bother your head about the grub
part, comrade; I’m carrying a small packet with
me that holds enough to keep two men alive for
a whole week—all we’ll have to do is to run
across some sort of spring, where we can get all
the drinking water we’ll need, while we wait for
the wagon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! in this case you’re meanin’ a <i>hearse</i>,
’cause mebbe we’ll have to shoot him up afore he
calls quits,” and Perk grinned horribly at his
own wit.</p>

<p class='c013'>So they left the ship stranded there, sprawled
out like a gigantic dragon-fly or a monstrous
toad. If Fortune proved kind they might yet
live to make good use of it again when the time
came to fly back to God’s country on the other
side of the border where defeated candidates
are in the habit of accepting the dictum of the
voters, and retiring from the field of battle await
the next call to arms, with ballots instead of
bullets as their method of settling elections.</p>

<p class='c013'>Side by side they set forth, like a pair of adventurers
starting out in search of Fortune’s
smiles, and careless alike as to whether they met
with success or not, so long as the excitement
they craved came their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk managed to conceal the chagrin with
which he buckled down to his unwelcome task,
walking always gave him a pain, mental rather
than physical but on the whole he was a good
scout, and could follow the beckoning finger of
duty, even though he loathed the conditions attached
to the performance of his role.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sand was far from compact, and allowed
them to sink in somewhat, so this made the going
more difficult in contrast to that on the seashore
which being beaten down by incoming waves is
often as hard as concrete and a pleasure to walk
over; whereas this of the desert was dry and
sifted at the least puff of wind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk having had some previous experience
with deserts, felt no love for the uninviting waste
places of the earth only such useless vegetation
as sage, greasewood, cactus and yucca would
grow between the sand dunes amidst the blistering
fangs of the infernal heat and always vowed
he disliked such arid regions with a violence too
deep for mere words.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet he kept his own counsel and plodded away
alongside his pal as if he had no personal feelings
in the matter whatsoever. Far off in front
of them they could see the line of peaks studded
against the sky once or twice Perk felt certain
he had caught a fluttering light aloft such as
might spring from a passing plane but in every
instance he finally decided it must be some shooting
star, ducking behind the mountain range,
leaving a trailing wake behind that but reflected
its passing glory.</p>

<p class='c013'>One hour, two, and then a third dragged along
before Jack thought fit to call a halt. Never did
poor weary footsore Perk, almost used up, listen
to more welcome and delightful words than
when Jack as he drew to a halt went on to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Time to rest, partner, you know—I’d like to
find a bunch of shady trees that would afford us
a decent shelter from the blazing sun, should we
be so unfortunate as to get adrift after leaving
all landmarks behind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! bless you for sayin’ that, buddy,” Perk
was saying hoarsely, for his throat seemed as dry
as tinder, the fine sand even affecting his vocal
cords so that he would not have recognized his
own voice. “By your leave I guess I’ll lie down
and get the kinks outen my legs. Wow! that
must abeen fi’ miles if she was one—my shoes
are full o’ sand, an’ altogether I don’t feel half
the man I was on startin’ out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There are some trees over yonder, you may
notice, Perk; so after we’ve caught our second
wind we’ll take chances, and cut across to where
they lie, perhaps when morning comes tripping
along, we may climb up the face of the mountain
and get a look-in at the printing establishment
that’s set itself up in opposition to the U. S.
Treasury Department, and the Federal Bank.
Come on then, a little further where we can drop
down, and rest our weary feet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards the pair had crept in
among the sheltering trees, where Jack called a
rest, although under the impression that they
should get along further before break of day.</p>

<p class='c013'>He talked matters over with his partner, speaking
almost in whispers, since in this enemy country
no one could take anything for granted and
for all they knew hostile ears might chance to
be close by, ready to listen in.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Perk himself who proposed to move
along while the going was good.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like we might be a heap better off, old
hoss, if on’y we located up thar on the side o’ the
mountain, where we could see without our bein’
watched. I’m okay now, an’ ready for b’ar.”</p>

<p class='c013'>That was the spirit Jack liked in his mate—a
readiness to take hold and reach a decision. They
moved along toward the base of the forbidding
height, keeping a watchful eye on the eastern
sky lest dawn come and surprise them in the
open, where it would not be easy to find a hiding
place during the entire day.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fortune favored them, for they managed to
get under cover before the first gray streaks appeared
in the east. It was bound to be a strenuous
task climbing that formidable mountain side
but Jack had prepared for even this part of the
adventure.</p>

<p class='c013'>From various sources he had learned how there
were three separate means for subduing that
grim pyramid of rocks and trees and tangled
growth—in order to lessen the chances of discovery,
with unpleasant consequences, Jack had
decided to try and negotiate the most difficult
of these mountain trails in the belief that it
would offer a safer passage since evidently none
of the seething revolutionists, or their allies, the
bad men from across the border, would be likely
to follow that canyon trail when others less difficult
could be utilized.</p>

<p class='c013'>Down there hidden by the bushes and spurs
of outlying rock they employed their time in
munching what must serve as their breakfast.
Then quenching their thirst at a convenient
pool they proceeded to climb the face of
the steep elevation, making for the quaint hollow
in the crater of a long dead volcano and which
had once been a Yaqui fort.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch29' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIX <br /> <br />NEARING THE GOAL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>They had now reached that most thrilling
point in their bold venture, where they would
have to “watch their steps” most carefully, lest
an incautious act precipitate a calamity that must
end all their hopes as well as snuff out their
lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>This breeding place for inflammatory embers
of Mexican revolutionary disappointed political
generals, and their immediate retainers, was
about as safe for the two sky detectives as a cage
of Bengal tigers would have been once let their
presence be suspected, and the entire neighborhood
would be scratched over as with a fine-tooth
comb in the endeavor to discover their
hiding place and should they be rounded up it
needed no magician to prophesy what their fate
must be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack led the way, with Perk following at his
heels, every sense on the alert. The native cougar
of that historical group of mountains could
hardly have crept along with greater care than
did the two human sleuth hounds of the law.
Every advance was attempted only after a careful
survey of the entire neighborhood—at the
sound of some faint bird-call Jack would sink
down and flatten himself upon the ground, his
example being imitated by his shadow.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this caused their progress to be exceedingly
slow but time did not enter into their calculations
so much as security—many hours must
pass ere Jack could figure on the arrival of those
upon whom everything depended and they
might as well make use of the entire morning in
climbing higher and higher toward their ultimate
goal.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once when they chanced to be resting their
tired limbs, snug in a sheltered nook behind a
mass of brushwood, Jack turned and looked back.
The site was especially fine for looking out on
the level stretch toward the spot where they had
landed during the preceding night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, watching the actions of his comrade,
could easily give a close guess as to what Jack
had in mind. This opinion was made more convincing
when he saw the other get out the useful
binoculars, and apply them to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Keenly he kept tabs on the others and was
finally thrilled to note the pleased nod Jack gave
as if wholly satisfied.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk touched him on the arm, and as Jack
turned made motions with his head, while his
eyebrows went up, his expression without a single
word being spoken signifying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How come?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take a look for yourself, and tell me if you
can get the first glimpse of our old crate” suggested
Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ doin,” whispered Perk, after a most
diligent search; “an’ if we can’t get a whiff o’
the boat, with these glasses, I kinder guess
nobody ain’t agoin’ to locate it with their naked
eyes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which same lets us out from any danger in
that quarter,” came softly from Jack, whose face
for the moment lost some of the strained look it
had borne during the last few hours.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never saw a better sample o’ camouflage
when I was across the big pond alistenin’ to the
smash o’ the rip-roarin’ German guns,” asserted
Perk; and then “dried up” when he saw the
other press a finger on his lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>Higher they climbed, like monkeys, taking all
manner of desperate chances when necessity
arose but so cautious was Jack in leading the
way that nothing amiss came about, every obstacle
being successfully surmounted until
shortly before the noon hour they found themselves
in a position to spy upon the camp of their
intended prey.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was intensely interested in what he now
visioned. The old crater, resembling an immense
football bowl, as adopted by some Eastern
colleges, looked as though it might have proven
well nigh impregnable as a fortress where the
fighting Yaquis were able to hold an army at
bay—which feat history records as an actual fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>Scattered about the depression were scores of
rude dwellings, some built of rocks, while others
more modern had walls composed of sun-baked
bricks, known throughout all Mexico as <i>adobes</i>.
Men and women, also children, could be seen
moving about, preparing the noonday meal or
partaking of their customary frijoles, hot tamales,
or it might be maize cakes cooked in the
hot ashes of fires, and with black coffee as a
beverage.</p>

<p class='c013'>The picture appealed to Perk, who delighted
in novel scenes nor did it seem to lose any of
its thrill from the fact that, as he very well knew,
the men he was staring at so eagerly were most
likely as tough a brand of desperadoes and villains
as could be grouped together anywhere on
earth—ready to fight, hold up trains, or commit
all manner of pillage at the drop of a hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>He marveled at the sagacity shown by Slippery
Slim in deciding to join forces with these
firebrands of the back country, with the idea of
thus securing the greatest safety for his own
lawless operations.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this while Jack had been keeping close
watch, in hopes of being able to pick out the
figure of the man he had been deputized to bring
back to the States so he might be prosecuted for
his crimes, and sent to Atlanta. There he would
possibly end his days in seclusion, with a large
portion of the Southwest breathing more freely
since they need no longer fear the avalanche of
counterfeit currency that had been demoralizing
business for such a long spell.</p>

<p class='c013'>After all it was Perk who made the discovery,
he chancing to be carefully handling the binoculars
at the time. He handed the glasses over to
his mate, and told Jack just where to look, using
as few words as possible, and keeping his voice
very low.</p>

<p class='c013'>Long and earnestly did Jack follow the movements
of the remarkable character who had been
described in his hearing so many times. What
satisfaction it afforded him to know he was actually
in sight of the big game and if only his
plans carried through his hour of triumph was
steadily drawing closer and closer. In imagination,
as he continued to watch the moving figure,
he could vision the pleasure it would afford him
when he could turn in his report to his Chief,
and mark it as completed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon drifted along, and night approached.
Nothing could be done to hasten the
crisis; they must wait patiently, and continue to
shape their plans until the expected smoke signal
told them Morales and his rough riders had
reached the foot of the Sierra Madres ten miles
further south and when assured by means of a
counter signal that everything was working well,
start to cover the last lap of their long ride, leave
their mounts at a safe distance, and complete the
journey on foot.</p>

<p class='c013'>When darkness fell the picture was even more
fascinating to Perk than before, with a number
of fires lighting up the huge bowl, the sound of
women chattering in Spanish, and children playing
just as all youngsters might do while from
time to time he could catch strains of music, telling
that some amorous swain might be practicing
on his guitar, as all who have a drop of Spanish
blood in their veins invariably love to do when
at leisure.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk doubtless made many a grimace while
partaking of the light refreshment afforded by
the tough pemmican Jack had produced, as their
sole means for staying their empty stomachs for
when the evening breeze wafted some of the
odors from the cooking fires down below it almost
set him wild with a desire to partake of hot
food. But he knew what he was up against, and
sternly repressed the inclination to groan his
protest.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was one of the longest nights Perk ever
knew. The mountain air, too, was cold, especially
along toward the last few hours and since
they were debarred from the joy of indulging
in a campfire, Perk could only lie there and
shiver. He never was so glad to see the pink
sky in the east as on that occasion.</p>

<p class='c013'>The day was but a repetition of their former
afternoon with their sole recreation being the
chance it gave them to watch Slippery Slim’s
movements whenever he appeared coming out of
what seemed to be a cavern of some sort from
which at several times when the racket from many
tongues died down Perk could catch a strange
rumbling sound, accompanied by what seemed
to be a blow, and which he could easily believe
must be the working of the printing press that
had been carried all the way from the States in
order to be able to produce those wonderfully
clever notes that had deceived many shrewd
bank tellers by their deceptive qualities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then at last Jack discovered, just as night had
begun to fall, three columns of smoke rising toward
the heavens from far down the wild Sierra,
telling how that Morales and his troop had arrived,
and that the curtain was about to rise on
the last scene of the international drama.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch30' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXX <br /> <br />JACK GETS HIS MAN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Immediately on discovering the welcome signal,
Jack dispatched Perk to put a match to the
heap of brush they had arranged well out of sight
from the depression where the skeleton revolutionary
army was slowly assembling its pitiful
force of the dissatisfied generals who had been
counted out in the last national election.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk understood what was expected of him,
and managed to send up a single smoke signal,
allowing it to have but a brief life and then hastening
to smother the fire. As Morales was expected
to be on the watch for just such a sign,
he would lose little time in starting to carry out
his part in the attack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In three hours they will be climbing the
mountain by way of the old Yaqui trail we followed,”
Jack was telling his chum, when the
other returned to his side, flushed with the success
of his labors. “It is time for us to make a
forward move, so that we may be ready to strike
as soon as the camp quiets down and corral our
man, leaving it to Morales to carry the fort itself
by storm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This they set about doing without any further
delay. Dodging from rock to rock, taking advantage
of every outlying spur, as well as patches
of hardy bushes, and other objects that were
likely to conceal their movements from any
watchful eyes but always creeping downward,
they crawled along like two great lizards such,
as Perk could remember seeing when in the
Philippines.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the time they were ready to slip into the
underground pressroom of the lawless printing
company’s plant, Jack figured the three hours
had just about expired, and that it was now up to
them to make the first hostile move that would
precipitate the assault.</p>

<p class='c013'>In thus deciding to make a start he was influenced
by seeing an agreed upon signal from
the same hiding place he and Perk had held for
so many hours, and which told him the troopers
had finally succeeded in climbing to the position
assigned to them when plans for action were
formed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Flattening themselves out against the dark
wall of a small cliff Jack and Perk glided along
until they arrived at that aperture in the solid
rock they knew to be the entrance to the wonderful
underground retreat that had been described
by Simeon at the time when in his desperation
he gave his confederates away and from which
they had watched Slippery Slim come and go
during those long hours of their espionage.</p>

<p class='c013'>Slipping inside, they found themselves in a
corridor that led into the body of the mountain
with a gleam of light beckoning them to advance.
In this fashion they kept moving, gliding from
one point to another, until eventually they had a
clear view of the little machine that was working
so industriously in turning out the bogus
money, hour after hour, as though the demand
were without limit.</p>

<p class='c013'>How Perk did stare, and hold his breath when
realizing that they were upon the verge of accomplishing
their great undertaking. Slippery
Slim was doing no actual manual labor himself,
but he kept close watch over the two men who
ran the press, closely scrutinizing the printed
bills as if to detect the slightest inaccuracy, and
correct it without delay.</p>

<p class='c013'>No wonder, Jack told himself, the product of
his skill had startled the financial world by its
genuine appearance, when such a master in his
particular line took such personal pains to see
that the work was carried out in its most minute
details.</p>

<p class='c013'>In whispers Jack informed his backer what his
duty would be when the roar of guns and hoarse
shouts from without announced that the picked
troopers had actually launched their long deferred
assault. Jack had taken it upon himself
to close in on the chief worker in that little
coterie, and have the glory of capturing Slippery
Slim unaided but meanwhile Perk might find
plenty of action in holding up those two others
who were second in importance only to the leading
figure.</p>

<p class='c013'>The tension had become almost unendurable
when suddenly there broke out a frightful uproar—women
were shrieking, children’s high
pitched voices told of intense alarm; men gave
tongue, and above it all guns began to sound with
deadly import, until the basin rocked with the
dreadful clamor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack waited no longer, but giving Perk a kick
on the shins to tell him to get busy he rushed
headlong toward Slippery Slim, holding his automatic
ready for instant service, knowing as he
did that such a desperate bad man as Slim
was reckoned from all accounts, would not be
apt to surrender so long as there remained the
slightest chance for a getaway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nor was he mistaken in judging the character
of the man who had so long defied the shrewdest
detectives of the United States Secret Service
for when Slim found his way to the open air
barred by such a determined looking figure, he
snatched out his handy gat and made as if to open
fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>For once he was just a trifle too slow with his
service gun, for Jack, clever lad that he was
along the line of firing off-hand, managed to send
a bullet through Slim’s right shoulder that crippled
him, so that his own weapon went rattling
to the stone under his feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put ’em up!” Jack was saying, covering his
man as he spoke and having no desire to commit
suicide, Slippery Slim obeyed the call; and
instantly afterwards suffering the painful ignominy
of having his wrists encircled by a pair
of nice new steel bracelets.</p>

<p class='c013'>So far so good, with Jack, his own share of the
capture an accomplished fact, able to turn in
order to lend Perk a helping hand. It was not
needed, for Perk had descended on those two
muscular chaps like a thunderbolt, knocking one
down with a terrific jolt under the chin and
causing the other to look along the short barrel
of his blued automatic, he having discarded the
repeating rifle for the time being in favor of
the easier handled pocket gun.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the trio of discomfited rogues were all
handcuffed, Jack and his reliable partner turned
and faced the other way, so as to be ready for a
rush, should some of those valorous generals
decide to take advantage of the defensive security
of the rock cave, and bolt into its gaping mouth.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being actually attempted they met with
a demoralizing surprise when they found themselves
the objects of a hot fire, that brought about
a complete right-about face movement and
presently forced their ignominious surrender to
the gallant Colonel Morales and his fierce fighters,
who had once before gone through an interesting
campaign in that same old extinct volcano
vent, with warlike redskins as their opponents.</p>

<p class='c013'>The end was not long in coming, with many
of the would-be revolutionists holding up their
hands in complete surrender others escaping
by losing themselves along the scraggly sides of
the mountains and not a few either slain outright,
or seriously wounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and his chum had a chance to meet the
doughty Colonel Morales, pride of the Mexican
army, and be congratulated on their clever work
of rounding up such a jack-o’-lantern, fly-by-night
as Slim Garrabrant. Of course the two
comrades were eager to start back to the other
side of the border, since complications might
come up over their legal warrant to arrest a criminal
so badly wanted by the Washington authorities,
but who had made his headquarters south
of the international line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly they handed over Slim’s two lieutenants,
who would have to answer to a charge
of being hand-in-glove with those plotting generals,
and doubtless find themselves incarcerated
in a Mexican dungeon for some years, a fate that
made Perk shudder to contemplate.</p>

<p class='c013'>While he stood guard over their prisoner, Jack
sent Perk off at dawn, mounted on one of the
cavalry horses, and accompanied by a soldier
who would fetch back both animals, Perk’s duty
being to get the stranded ship off the ground,
and drop down at a more convenient spot closer
to the former mountain stronghold of the tiger-like
Yaquis.</p>

<p class='c013'>By nightfall they were hundreds of miles on
their way over Arizona and New Mexico, Jack
having decided to carry his prisoner, whose
wound did not prove to be very serious, though
painful enough—all the way to Washington, and
present him to his superior, with his customary
air of not realizing that he had done anything
extraordinary.</p>

<p class='c013'>That this thrilling feat was only a common
occurrence in the lives of such intrepid manhunters
as serve the Government through the
agency of the Secret Service and that from time
to time Jack and Perk might with reason be
expected to duplicate such adventurous feats can
be set down as certain; indeed, the title of the
next number in the Sky Detective Series, “<i>Eagles
of the Sky; or With Jack Ralston Along the Air
Lanes</i>,” a tale of the smugglers of the Florida
Coast, will grip the reader from start to finish,
and prove to be one of the most thrilling stories
ever written for lovers of action and valor.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

  <h2 id='ch01' class='c011'>CHAPTER I <br /> <br />READY FOR THE TAKE-OFF</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>It was a day in the late Fall when Jack
Ralston, accompanied by his best pal, Gabe
Perkiser, known simply as “Perk” by all his
friends, found themselves climbing out of a
hired taxi that had halted on the border of
Candler Flying Field just a short distance out
of Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! reg’lar mob out here today, seems
like,” observed Perk, as he took note of the
triple line of cars parked around the field, with
its numerous up-to-date hangars, and with ships
coming and going every few minutes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, you see Perk, it happens to be a big day
at stunt flying, with fat prizes for the winners.
All the better for us, I’d say, since our take-off
will hardly make a ripple in the pond, with all
this confusion going on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing, my boy,” continued Perk, with
one of his humorous grins that betokened a good-natured
chap; “and privacy’s just what we crave.
I guess now that might be the mail comin’ from
down East an’ New York?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A rotten guess then, Perk,” chortled the
other; “Eastern mail boat was due here at six-ten
this morning; the Pitcairn Aviation concern
handle that route, as well as the run between
Atlanta and Miami down in Florida; and I’m
telling you for a fact the boys holding the stick
with <i>that</i> corporation are nearly always on time
to the dot, come storm, come fog as thick as
pea-soup. The schedule I glimpsed at the Atlanta
post office gave the time of the East Coast
ship as seven-thirty P. M.; that from New Orleans
at six-thirty P. M.; and the one from
Chicago about the same time. So you see it
couldn’t be a mail crate dropping down right
now, unless they’d had to make a forced landing,
and lost time in making repairs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, come to think of it I sure did hear a
bus passin’ over just at peep o’ day,” admitted
Perk. “Let’s have a look-in while we’re here,
and see what a bag o’ tricks these stunt flyers
are holdin’ up their sleeves, so’s to give this
crowd a row o’ thrills.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suits me, Perk; no great hurry about our
jumping off, so long as we pull the gun before
dark sets in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! little difference it makes on a patch
as well lighted as this Candler Field o’ your
home city, old boy; and with a flashlight beacon
set every ten miles all the way down to Orleans,
to keep us on our course. Look at that guy
fairly burning the air like hot cakes—he must
be tryin’ to beat the speed record, I guess, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hardly a day comes without some record
going by the board,” remarked Jack, who had
a reputation as a safe and sane pilot, although
on occasion he had been known to put through
some tricks so death-defying as to make the
hearts of the spectators seem to jump up in
their throats with the thrill.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was quite correct when he stated that
Atlanta was the home city of his close friend
and chum; although Jack’s family had moved
away years back, and become fruit raisers in
far-off California. Still, having spent some
years in the Georgia capital Jack always liked
to drop in and renew a limited number of old
friendships when opportunity offered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack Ralston had begun his aviation work
starting at the lowest round, that of a Gypsy
pilot, flying an ancient boat at County Fairs and
Harvest Home gatherings; doing aerial stunts,
and “bailing out” by means of a parachute while
another pilot ran the ship; also taking up air
minded “sand-bags” as passengers at so much
each person.</p>

<p class='c013'>From this modest beginning he had finally
accepted a position with an aircraft corporation
having contracts with the Post Office Department
at Washington for carrying the mails, and
later on express matter as well; and last of all
working for Uncle Sam through joining the
Secret Service corps of skillful detectives, whose
activities covered every part of the Nation, and
even to adjacent countries as well.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the Government wearied of the bold
doings of one “Slippery Slim” Garrabrant, and
decided to “clip the wings” of that audacious
freebooter and bogus-money crook, it was only
natural they should pick Jack for this service.
The reasons for doing so were many, but what
counted most was Jack’s well known cleverness
as an all-round air pilot; for it happened that
the slick rogue who had been giving the revenue
men such a wild-goose chase, with his thumb
held up to his nose, so to speak, was himself a
remarkable master of the air lanes, he having
been an ace as a flying pilot over with the army
on the Argonne front in France.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since as a rule this troublesome offender carried
on his bold enterprises by means of a handy
plane—frequently with a single assistant, who
helped handle both ship and cargo—the man
thus selected to put a crimp in his activities was
likewise given full permission to engage a helper
from the same arm of the Government forces,
one who must of course know something about
the handling of a plane, so that in case of necessity
he could serve as co-pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack lost no time in picking Gabe Perkiser,
otherwise known simply as “Perk”—a man who
had supped with adventure since he was “knee
high to a duck”—a half Yankee—half Canuck,
drifting into the army, and serving with the
sausage observation balloon corps over in
France; from which patriotic occupation he
later on became a champion light-weight boxer.
Leaving the ring while as yet undefeated he
served for several years with the Canadian
Mounted Police. Here his smartness in usually
fetching back his man, no matter what the difficulties
that had to be surmounted, attracted
the attention of a gentleman connected with
Uncle Sam’s Secret Service, just then moose
hunting over the northern border, who finally
influenced Perk to join up with his force.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and the other had met under peculiar
conditions when both were tracking a bunch of
check raisers floating across the country and
leaving a wide swath of victims in their path.
They had become more than friends, although
meeting but seldom; then, when the opportunity
came for Jack to call upon Perk to join him in
the new job that had been turned over to his
charge, the latter had responded with alacrity.</p>

<p class='c013'>So here they were, on the threshold of an
affair that promised to engage their united talents
in running down the leader of the most
troublesome gang of counterfeit currency makers
known to the Government agents in the last
ten years.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every clue possessed at Headquarters had
been turned over to Jack at the time he was
given authority to carry on as the situation demanded;
although this information was a bit
limited, and much was left to the shrewdness
of the two trail hounds themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no hurry at all, and Jack had
always been one of those cautious workers who
meant to provide for all sorts of emergencies.
Only too well did he know how many a splendid
undertaking went on the rocks from lack of
foreseeing the next move on the part of the
astute criminals whose apprehension meant so
much to the Government, as well as the folks
they were victimizing.</p>

<p class='c013'>But by now he had decided everything was
arranged so far as human means would permit,
and that it was high time they started on their
long chase. Their boat, a Stinson Detroiter, a
monoplane with a Wright Whirlwind motor,
and reckoned to be an unusually swift craft, was
already loaded, and ready for immediate departure.
It had been stored in one of the big
hangars connected with the Candler Flying
Field but could be taxied into position when
Jack felt ready to skip off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their flying togs were also contained in a
locker in the same hangar, and could be donned
in a jiffy, even to the ’chute harness that was
so familiar to Jack, and a constant reminder of
early experiences when he was accustomed to
carry out his daily program of “quitting the
ship” with as much <i>sang froid</i> as though the
jump into space from a five thousand foot ceiling
were absolutely next to nothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>But plainly Perk was becoming a bit restless,
as though eager to be on his way; which fact
doubtless influenced Jack to eventually give the
word that took them to their hangar. Here
they commenced preparing for a night flight
that was expected to land them in New Orleans,
where Jack was to interview a certain representative
of the Government service, from whom
he anticipated receiving a few valuable tips that
would give them something tangible and serve
as a beginning of their arduous chase.</p>

<p class='c013'>While they were thus engaged someone
hailed them with a boisterous greeting, at which
Perk grinned, and made a suitable reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hey, Scotty, this your night off, is it—got
in from your route okay, and stepped out to see
the boys cut a few figger-eights in the sky—just
can’t keep away from the game, even when you
got a lay-off? What’s new, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They told me at the house you expected to
step off tonight, boys—is that a fact, or did they
slip an easy one over me, I want to know?” demanded
the other, who was apparently a mail
pilot friend of theirs—in fact, having the adjoining
room at the small hotel where they were
stopping.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” Jack told him, secretive as usual,
“we’re going further, and boosting the Stinson
Detroiter ship by showing what it has to set it
above most other boats. Plans not fully arranged
as yet, but we’re on our way; so it’s good-bye,
and good luck to you, Scotty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about that news, Scotty?” the insistent
Perk went on to demand, being by nature one of
those stubborn chaps who can never be happy
until they get what they are after, no matter
how trivial it may seem.</p>

<p class='c013'>The air mail pilot scratched his head, and
then with a grin answered Perk’s question.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much along the line of aviation;
but something queer happened to me—say, did
you boys sleep at home last night while I was
on the road?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We sure did,” Perk told him, and then
added: “What makes you ask that, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Didn’t hear any sort of racket in my den
did you, fellows?” continued the other; at which
Perk, after exchanging a look of bewilderment
with his pal, hastened to answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a thing, Scotty; but then you know I
sleep like a log; and it’d have to be a thunderclap
to wake me up; what’s been going on?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You got me guessing, Perk,” said the other,
with a look of disgust; “only when I got in this
morning I found my room looking like a hurricane
had struck it, my things tossed out of drawers,
my trunk broken open, and say, you never
saw such a dirty mess. Course I asked the boss
what it meant; but he was as much surprised
as I was—talked with every servant from the
cook down to Mary the chamber maid; but
nobody could tell a darned thing about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again Jack and Perk exchanged a swift
glance, as though the same idea had struck both
of them. Scotty did not appear to notice this,
being too worked up with the mystery that had
so suddenly gripped his fortunes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did you lose anything worth while, Scotty?”
Jack asked, in a voice that suggested sympathy;
but to his surprise the other shook his head in
the negative, and even grinned as he lifted his
heavy eyebrows to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s the funny part of it, boys; whoever
the sneak thief was, he didn’t even dent me a
little bit—so far as I c’n see not a blessed thing
is missing—fact is, I’m even better off than before
he paid that queer visit, ’cause he left this
old pocketbook mixed up with my traps; and
it ain’t mine for a fact, though I’m meaning to
spend the little wad of dough it holds. Like
manna coming down to the children of Israel
in the Wilderness, wouldn’t you say, boys?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lucky old hoss you are, Scotty,” remarked
Perk, enviously; while Jack nodded his head as
though to echo the sentiment.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c014'>CHAPTER II <br /> <br />THE LUCK OF SCOTTY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Happen to have that pocketbook along with
you, Scotty?” asked Jack, in a matter of fact
tone; just as though he might be possessed of
ordinary curiosity concerning so amazing a
visit; since never before had he heard of a night
prowler leaving his own money behind him,
when his intention had been to rob his victim.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing, Jack,” promptly replied the air
mail pilot; “here, take a squint at my Christmas
present, dropped in by old Santa Claus
a bit before the reg’lar holiday season,” and with
a laugh he chucked the object in question into
the hand of the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Old, just as you remarked, Scotty,” observed
Jack, “and used a long time. It must have
slipped out of his pocket when he worked your
stuff over to mix it up like the devil.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Open it up and see what the blessed chump
left me in place of his card,” the other continued,
looking exceedingly proud over his lucky
find.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did that with alacrity; in fact it
was what he intended doing, for reasons of his
own; something more than curiosity influencing
him, it would appear.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gee whiz! a neat little bunch of the needful,
I’d say, Scotty, old hoss!” burst out the envious
Perk, his eyes fixed full upon the contents of
the much worn pocketbook, which Jack was
holding in his hand and apparently interested
in counting, for there were a number of bank
notes for various amounts, and among them just
three five-dollar bills, seemingly quite fresh,
though a bit soiled, as though they had been in
circulation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nineteen smackers in all,” announced Perk,
showing that he had also been keeping tabs on
the count. “Well, wouldn’t that knock you cold
though? Huh? that same caller must’ve been
looking for <i>me</i>, and just missed connections by
striking the next door. Well, here’s wishing you
the same old luck every time a sneak thief pays
you a visit, Scotty boy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack on his part was feeling of the three five-dollar
bills, and holding them up to the light
from the western sun that managed to come
into the hangar by way of the open doors.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What ails you, Jack?” demanded the recipient
of Fortune’s smiles, as he noticed these
strange actions on the part of his new friend.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much,” he was told, “only I’m going
to give you a bit of advice, partner, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to it, boy; always willing to take it
when it seems sound!” snapped the mail carrier,
briskly enough, still more than curious.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you’re wise, Scotty,” went on Jack, smilingly,
“you’ll not try to pass any one of these
five-dollar bills until you’ve asked the opinion
of some bank teller—it might get you into
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Zowie! what’s that you’re saying, Jack—don’t
tell me they’re off-color bills, counterfeits
in fact. Wouldn’t that be a rotten deal to hand
out, and me figgering how I’d spend them? Is
<i>that</i> what you mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon it’s so, Scotty, much as I hate to
knock your good luck,” Jack told him, with a
shake of his head. “I happened to have a little
experience in a small bank some years ago and
they did say I showed signs of being a clever
detector of bad money. That’s a clever job all
right; but I’m afraid it won’t stand the wash
worth a cent. Go slow, and don’t count your
chickens before they’re hatched. Also I’d advise
you not to go around telling about your windfall
until you’ve shown this stuff to some friendly
bank official, whose advice you’d be willing to
take. If he says it’s good stuff why forget what
I’m saying, and go the limit. But we’d better
be finishing our own job, Perk, and get off on
our jump.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Scotty hung around for a short time, looking
puzzled, as though he hardly knew how much
to believe. What Jack had said in his friendly
fashion had doubtless cast quite a damper on
certain bright dreams in which he had been indulging.
However, he finally decided to take
himself off, evidently eager to know whether
the laugh was on him or not, for he called out:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goodbye, Jack, Perk; and be sure to look me
up when next you drop in at Candler Field Airport;
like as not I’ll still be on my old job here,
unless they decide to transfer me somewhere else.
And say, Jack, I’m meaning to take your advice,
and get an opinion on this here stuff ’fore I try
to pass it out on any old duffer. So-long boys
and luck!”</p>

<p class='c013'>When the two comrades, adventure bound,
found themselves alone they looked at each other
in silence for almost a full minute, when a grin
started to travel over Perk’s well bronzed face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, wouldn’t it jar you though, to have such
luck knock at your door, and then give you a sly
kick?” he demanded of his companion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To tell the honest truth, Perk, I’m not thinking
about Scotty and his queer windfall; it’s
our own great good luck that’s making me suspect
we’re bound to carry this job through with
flying colors.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Eh? now what d’ye mean by saying that?”
asked the other hastily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right in the beginning, Perk, we seem to
have stumbled on a nice little plum in the shape
of a clue—flung directly at our heads, you might
say in the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! do you mean to tell me those bogus
notes were off the same plates we’ve been
hearing so much about lately that I’ve been
dreamin’ I was tied hand an’ foot, an’ poked
under a dozen bales of them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just that, as sure as you live, partner,” said
Jack, composedly; but if he could take it so
coolly, not so his right bower who showed signs
of extreme excitement and satisfaction, for he
thrust out his hand, that had so often been an
object of vast respect on the part of some welter
weight boxer, and insisted that Jack accept a
gentle shake.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re sure Fortune’s favorites,” Perk was
saying, striking an attitude as he thus proudly
spoke; “an’ with such luck hoverin’ over our
heads I vow all the Lower Regions with its devils
can’t prevail against us. But see here, old hoss,
there’s more than chance in this break o’ the
party who broke through Scotty’s door, and
panned all his traps—I guess now he must have
missed a cylinder, an’ jest passed us by in a
ground loop.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was accustomed to the other’s quaint way
of expressing himself, for he lost no time in
adding:</p>

<p class='c013'>“About that way, I take it, Perk. And if
what we suspect turns out to be true, it stands to
reason there’s some sort of big combine back of
it all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“With this same Slippery Slim Garrabrant
pulling the wires for the whole bunch, is that
what you mean, Jack?” demanded the other flyer
quickly; for when once set on the right track
Perk’s mind could travel speedily enough.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s certainly his brain that’s built up this
wide flim-flam trade in the make believe green
stuff that’s been fooling a whole lot of bank tellers,
it’s so near the genuine article. To
smash the combine we’ve got to check up on
Slim; after he’s caged the entire arrangement’s
bound to fall through.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, partner; and them’s my sentiments
every time,” admitted the eager Perk. “And
here, when we’re starting out to pull off our
fresh stunt, I’m wishing all the luck that’s going
to our little game. Meaning to give her a last
checking over, eh, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s a habit of mine, as you know, Perk; and
you might amuse yourself stowing the cargo
we’ve taken aboard, so’s to let us have room for
our feet when we take off. From the looks of
the junk you picked up anybody’d reckon we
planned to go into camp for a week or two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, mebbe that’s what’ll happen to us before
we strike pay dirt in this ticklish job,”
asserted Perk, stoutly. “You know we figgered
things out, and made up our minds this same
slick article of a Slim might have his hangout
over the line in Old Mexico, where he prints
his bad bills, and then comes across the line with
a big bunch in his ship, so’s to scatter the stuff
around to his agents in Texas and Arizona, or
it might be all through Southern California. If
that guess turns out to be a bullseye we might
be away off the line of travel for days at a stretch,
and a grub stake’d turn the trick okay, I’m thinking,
boss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack made no reply, for he was already busily
engaged in looking over his crate. This was, as
he had mentioned, an old habit, contracted in
the early days of his career as an aviator of sorts;
and most likely such extreme caution had saved
his life more than once.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he too worked close by, Perk was thinking
more or less about something that had caught
his ever watchful eye just before they entered
the hangar to make these last preparations for
their southern flight. As usual he was unable
to keep his speculations entirely to himself, since
he always liked to compare notes, and find out
whether his companion’s views coincided with
his own.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, Jack, did you happen to notice that
Ryan ship they’d just taken out of the shed before
ours?” he demanded, while still lifting
packages of various supplies, and stowing them
away in a shipshape fashion; so they would not
be likely to shift, and thus imperil the safety
of himself and comrade, should they chance to
encounter rough weather later on.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not particularly,” came the answer. “I was
too busy over my own affairs to bother with anything
that didn’t concern me in the least. What
of it, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much, old hoss, only it was a next
to new bus, and hadn’t been flown more’n a few
thousand air miles, I’d guess. Couple of fellers
seemed to be the crew, one of ’em lookin’ like
he might be a pilot; and the other a chap that
was out to have a jolly good time sportin’ for
sport. I saw him handlin’ some sort of gun,
which made me guess he was down South for
the shootin’ season—mebbe after bear in the
Louisiana canebrakes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack laughed as if amused, for he had noted
the way in which the other made this stab at
what might be the designs of the unknown
parties.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Feel a bit envious I take it, Perk,” he observed,
laconically. “Always did yearn for the
day to come when you’d have a ship of your
own, and could spend all your spare time jumping
about the country, enjoying yourself with
rod and gun. Cheer up, old sport, you may live
to see that day yet, if things break right for us
in a few big games like this one we’re running
down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thanks for your good luck wishes, Jack,” the
other was saying; “I c’n just picture the bully
times that pair’ll like enough have sitting by
their camp-fire, living on game they’ve knocked
over, and not caring a darn whether school
keeps or not. Oh! well, if I live long enough
mebbe I may have a whiff of that kind of life
before I kick off for keeps; they say everything
comes to the man who waits, and that’s me.
There, that finishes my job, with everything
stowed away as slick as you please. When you’re
ready, Jack, we’ll be on our way.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c014'>CHAPTER III <br /> <br />HEADED SOUTH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Apparently Jack had completed his task
about the same time, for he was adjusting his
’chute harness, without which he seldom made a
long distance flight. This was only second nature
to him, because of the long experience he
had had in barnstorming, and doing stunts for
a living in years gone by.</p>

<p class='c013'>This accomplished, he stepped outside the
hangar, and beckoned to a couple of ground
workers who chanced to be close by, possibly
in anticipation of their services being required,
with a tip in prospect.</p>

<p class='c013'>Between them the ship was moved to the open,
and after that it would be a simple thing for
Jack to taxi across the strip of ground adjoining
the big Pitcairn hangar, so as to face such
wind as was stirring.</p>

<p class='c013'>With what Perk had said concerning the new
Ryan monoplane and its crew still fresh in his
mind, Jack did give a brief glance in that quarter.
He could only see that both men were fully
equipped with dungarees, helmets, and even
chutes fastened to their backs; which combination
was an effectual disguise, since their best
friends might have failed to recognize either
of them offhand.</p>

<p class='c013'>The one who was garbed in what seemed to
be fresh clean overalls, and who must be the
employer, seemed to feel a mild interest in their
movements, for he was looking that way through
his goggles, that had been pulled down as if in
preparation for some species of flight. The
other was busying himself adjusting something,
and from his greasy dungarees it was evident
he must be the working pilot of the Ryan craft.</p>

<p class='c013'>With all the bustle that was going on covering
the stunt flying and speed races, Jack did
not bother taking a second look; he failed to
have the same interest in the possible sporting
excursion of the unknown pair that had gripped
Perk and hence failed to let the matter occupy
any more of his limited time.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon both settled down in their respective
places in the double cockpit of the ship,
Jack of course occupying the front seat, since
he had been placed in command, with the other
acting as co-pilot and observer.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a very decent crate taken in all, that
had been secured for their work on this special
occasion, for Uncle Sam is never stingy in supplying
his agents of the Secret Service with
whatever they need, from means for swift travel
to the customary “grub” necessary to their upkeep
when “on the road.” These air detectives
in whom we are particularly interested just now,
as a rule were angling for big fish, and it was
absolutely necessary they should be given a free
hand when making their demands for proper
backing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it’s goodbye to Candler Field for us
right now,” remarked Perk, as he shot a general
look around, being more or less interested in
the exciting events being pulled off in the air
circus. “Playtime’s past, and now we’ve just
got to put in our best licks along the line of
business. Huh! seems like them two guys are
meaning to pull out right on our heels, from the
lively way that greasy lad is jumping around—keeps
an eye on us in the bargain, as if it mattered
a lick whether we did get going before
he was ready to follow suit. Some folks never
do like anybody to show ’em their dust, even
when it don’t matter a pinch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then Jack waved his hand toward the two
hostlers whom he had generously tipped, and
pulled the gun in his accustomed careful fashion;
after which they started along the level
field for the takeoff, there being small necessity
for a runway on such a generous fairway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Faster and faster they flew along the ground,
and then with their wheels parting contact with
the earth up they started at an easy incline.
The roar of the motor already drowned most of
the clamor from the surging crowd, while the
racket of the whizzing propeller added to the
chorus so joyous to the ears of all real air pilots,
since nothing pleases them more than to feel they
are masters of a ship that is in “apple-pie” condition
for battling whatever lies ahead, be it
storm, fog or whatnot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Somehow Perk was twisting his head around
as if curious to ascertain whether that Ryan
crate had succeeded in imitating their example,
and was already making the preliminary dash
across the field—which luckily enough had
chanced to be fairly clear of maneuvering
planes, either descending, taking off, or being
taxied into position for the next stunt on the
program.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was getting well along by this
time, and already the first dim shadows of approaching
night were to be seen slipping
out from certain patches of pine trees ahead.
But the higher they climbed, now that a start
had been accomplished, the lighter it would become,
what with a lower horizon, and the sun
still hanging in plain sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once free from any possibility of any contact
with the wheeling and ducking planes—some of
which were doing the barrel roll, and others
making successive somersaults, with the daring
pilots proceeding while in an inverted position—Jack
could start spiraling, and climbing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rapidly was Candler Field fading from view
behind them since Jack had swung toward the
south, as if to lay his course directly for New
Orleans. Perk seemed to find a subtle attraction
back where they had just come from, since he
was again turning his head with nothing else to
do save gratify his innocent curiosity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! ’pears like they might be meaning to
strike for the Louisiana canebrake country, and
black bear diggings, just like I said,” he was
telling himself, with a chuckle of amusement
over his shrewd guess. “And say, that little
Ryan crate’s no slouch ’bout making speed, I’d
mention. Come along you sportin’ crowd—plenty
of room in the ceiling overhead, an’ nixey
a chance to bring about a collision. Take your
choice, and cut out for all you’re worth, boys.
If you get there before we do, just tell ’em we’re
acomin’ too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk continued to amuse himself in watching
the antics of the rival ship, and indulging in
all kinds of wild speculations as to what the real
object of those two sporty looking occupants
might prove to be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently thus far not the slightest suspicion
had entered his mind that the taking to the air
of the shining Ryan boat had the first thing to
do with their own skipping out, and heading
toward the Crescent City.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like as not when it gets real dark after a
bit,” Perk continued to say, being addicted to
talking to himself more or less, “we’ll soon lose
her, and have the field all to ourselves. Only
moving thing I c’n sight back there, ’cept them
circlin’ buzzards huntin’ for a carrion supper.
Guess everything’s going along first class
and we’re in for a comfortable night run down
over the corn and sugarcane country. This is
the life for little Perk, you hear me saying,
everybody—it’s got the boxin’ game, and even
that outdoor life up with the Mounties in Canada,
beat to a frazzle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk busied himself with his duties for
some time, and presently became aware of the
fact that evening was actually at hand; for the
sun had dropped out of sight over in the far
west, and looking down he found it absolutely
impossible to distinguish what lay beneath them
some two thousand feet more or less earthward—there
might be forests, farms, hills or swales
following each other in rapid succession; but all
masked by the sable curtains of night. When
the moon rose later on, its light would not afford
them any opportunity for marking any peculiarities
of the ground down there, since it must
simply present the appearance of a swiftly moving
panorama.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, moved once more by his old curiosity
concerning the ship that had started off immediately
after their own jump, again twisted his
head so as to take another backward look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hanged if she ain’t keeping on our tail right
along,” he told himself, as if a bit surprised,
though not in the least troubled, since there
could be no possible connection between this
Ryan monoplane and their own old bus, bent
on reeling off so many miles per hour, and aiming
to make the airport at New Orleans by early
dawn or before, according to how the weather
treated them, and the speed Jack could coax
from his aerial steed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Further inspection convinced Perk that the
rival ship was neither gaining nor losing as the
two sped along their way; a fact that began to
make him “sit up and take notice,” and then
express himself confidentially:</p>

<p class='c013'>“By jinks! it looks to me like that clever little
Ryan bus could make circles around our tub
’less Jack c’n squeeze a lot more snap from our
Whirlwind motor. Now what game c’n that
pair of sports be playin’ right now, I want to
know—must be they’re so used to bettin’ on
anything an’ everything they’re meanin’ to keep
right on our tail all night long, just to make us
hump along, and get the laugh on us poor
guys.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c014'>CHAPTER IV <br /> <br />THE GRIM PURSUER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>As the minutes crept along Perk’s uneasiness
commenced to make itself more manifest, finally
reaching such a condition that he felt it would
ease his mind if only he could get the opinion
of his companion on the subject.</p>

<p class='c013'>To do this it would be necessary that they
should make use of the head earphones that had
been taken along for this particular purpose.
Accordingly he quickly adjusted his own, and
then proceeded to advise Jack as to what he
wished to do. Since these useful adjuncts of the
pilot’s outfit were so arranged that they could
be slipped on and off with little loss of time,
it was an easy matter for Perk to apply them,
after which he went on to speak.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, seems like that pesky little Ryan insect’s
been tailing us right along, though mebbe
now you didn’t notice it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know it, Perk—fact is I proved that fact
to my own satisfaction, for twice now I’ve
changed our course, once into the west, and
again heading into the southwest, even if it
didn’t catch your attention.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You did that same; and say, what happened,
Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a blessed thing,” came the immediate
answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They still hung on our tail, do you mean,
old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like they did—queer how two pilots,
strangers both, would take a notion to change
their course, not once but twice running,” commented
Jack in his non-committal fashion that
always had Perk guessing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Strikes me as something more than a happy
chance,” asserted Perk, beginning to throw off
that comfortable feeling with which he had
wrapped himself as he contemplated a steady
going night run, with never a reason for anything
gripping them by way of excitement;
“ev’ry little movement of that Ryan two-seater’s
got a meanin’ of its own. Now what ails the
ducks I want to know—how c’n our movements
have a mite to do with what they’re planning
to carry out—got any idea along them lines, old
hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing definite as yet,” answered Jack; “I
was starting to figure it out just when you barged
in, and opened this talk fest up with your question.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, come to think of it, what did you make
out of that stiff yarn Scotty put over on us a
while ago?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was raw stuff for a fact; but I don’t question
anything he told us, remember, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whoever his mysterious visitor was he must
have been hunting for something, that’s dead
sure!” declared Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Something he didn’t find, either,” continued
Jack’s assistant pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Scotty was ready to swear to that fact, and
he ought to know.” Jack countered by saying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“But see here, old hoss, you’ve got some sorter
idea what the game might abeen, haven’t you
for a fact?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon I know why the sneak thief failed
to carry away the thing he was looking for, if
that’s what you mean, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As what, boss—I’m all worked up wantin’
to know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perhaps the reason might have been because
the object of his search happened at that very
time to be safe and snug in the inside pocket
of this same coat I’m wearing under my overalls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At hearing this startling announcement Perk
gave a quick look into his pal’s face, there being
just enough light remaining in the western sky
to allow this searching glance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! now I’m beginning to get somewhere,
and ready to quit this gropin’ around,
like a man in a London fog—that letter you had
this very morning from Headquarters—somehow
’r other some of the gang had wind of your
gettin’ it, and they guessed it’d be kept
safe under lock and key in your room at the
hotel; and then they got balled up about the
number on the door, so they broke into the wrong
room. Jack, am I on the right track?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems that’s so, according to my notion,
Perk; unless I miss my guess that’s the way
things stand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A disgusted grunt from Perk told that he did
not feel very happy over certain facts in the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gosh-a-mighty!” he burst out, explosively,
“if that’s right, then the tricky crowd know you’n
me are on this case—that even right now we’re
starting out to pluck their tail feathers, and
fetch that master-crook to the bar!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! I expected that would happen,” said
Jack, indifferently. “Having been told by several
of the best men in the service that Slim was
the smartest all-round dopester known in all the
land, I anticipated that he’d have means for
finding out that fact long ago—that there might
be a leak around Headquarters; for spies can
worm in almost anywhere, given an opportunity,
and the backing of a big bunch of jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yet that fact don’t seem to rattle you worth
a red cent, old hoss,” continued the puzzled
Perk, who ofttimes found the actions of his cool
partner a mystery he could not solve, because of
his own more impetuous ways.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope not,” was all Jack said in reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thunder and lightning!” ejaculated the co-pilot,
as if an illuminating idea had suddenly
flashed through his brain—“that Ryan bus,
Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what of it?” demanded the one at the
stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What if that sporty guy I told you about
should turn out to be the critter who broke into
Scotty’s room, and made it a complete wreck?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It could happen that way, Perk; seems like
you’re working on a warm scent right now. Pity
we didn’t get a good look at the gentleman before
he hid his face behind that helmet and goggles;
then at least we’d know him if ever we happened
to run across his trail.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The other was almost frothing at the mouth
through disgust and anger combined; but he
managed to say, with a select few hard words
interlarded as a vent to his outraged feelings:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Give me half a chance and I’ll mark him so
there’s be no difficulty in locating the sneak when
we meet him again—I’d put a bit of lead
through his arm that’d keep him out of the scrap
for a week of Sundays; or else clip off one of
his ears, to stamp him as a low-down crook.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack knew full well that this was no idle threat
on the part of his running mate; for Perk had a
reputation as a pistol shot second to none in the
entire service, being a natural born marksman.</p>

<p class='c013'>He lapsed into a spell of silence after making
that vicious remark; but from the way he
glanced back again and again it looked as
though Perk meant to keep close tabs on the
craft that was dogging their own ship so
steadily.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were roaring on their way, and it would
seem as if they must be showing a clean pair of
heels to anything in their rear; but just the same,
Perk, with the vision of an air-minded individual,
could readily understand how the speedy
Ryan plane was slowly but insidiously picking
up on them continuously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blamed nuisance,” he was muttering to himself
when this important fact became a positive
truth; “guess now that rip-snorter could make
circles round us, if so be he wanted to. Shucks!
what’s left to us I want to know; an’ just what
does he ’spect to accomplish with all this chasin’
us? Might as well get out my little old
six-shot bear gun, so’s to be ready in case
there’s any sort o’ ruction aheadin’ our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The idea seemed to afford him a strange sort
of grim satisfaction, for bending down he ran
his hand under the coaming of the cockpit; to
almost immediately withdraw a very decent
looking sporting repeating rifle, evidently his
working tool whenever he felt disposed to spend
a week in the wilds, either alone, or with some
boon companions also yearning for wild game
and the much desired campfire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold tight, Perk,” Jack was saying just
then; “going into a nose dive, and see if that
will upset his calculations; for he’s got me buffaloed
all right as to what’s in the wind!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Almost immediately they turned the nose of
their craft earthward, and went down on a
swift slant. Perk kept his head turned even as
this maneuvre was being executed, and what he
saw was something calculated to almost take
his breath away; for where the pursuing Ryan
ship loomed up as a shadowy form, vivid
splashes, as of fire, were coming in quick succession—he
could even imagine he heard the pulsating
staccato reports following each other in
succession, just as in those never-to-be-forgotten
days when he would have a covey of
devil-may-care German air fighters stepping on
the tail of his old-fashioned boat, and peppering
him from their rapid-firing guns!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c014'>CHAPTER V <br /> <br />THE DUEL IN THE AIR</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The significant flashes abruptly ceased; but
Perk realized this was only because the expert
pilot handling that same Ryan wasp was also
ducking down in an exact copy of their own
game.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the moment Perk lost sight of the shadowy
pursuing craft; then Jack changed his tactics,
and once again brought his boat on an even
keel. Perk strained his eyesight in an endeavor
to pick up the other ship after it too had swung
into a direct course.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Devil take that guy at the stick,” he stormed
to himself, although Jack caught almost every
word, since the earphones were still in operation,
“he’s seen our move, an’ gone us one better.
No slouch o’ a pilot, either, I’ll admit. When
that gent who goes by the name o’ Slippery Slim
picks his gang he knows how to pull trumps
out of the pack all right. Give him another
shoot, Jack, old hoss; mebbe he wont be so lucky
next time. He’s got some kind o’ a rapid-fire
shooter aboard, and had started to send a hail
o’ lead ’bout our ears just as you turned the trick
on him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was apparently quite willing to give a
repeat, for hardly had the other ceased shouting
than they again shot down in a dizzy dive
that seemed likely to lower their altitude by
something like five hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was keeping a close watch, and knew
that once more the grim pursuer had copied
their daring maneuvre.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s a good one, or I’ll eat my hat!” he burst
out, as they were “cutting a blue streak” once
more through the growing darkness, and he
could see those suggestive flashes again punctuating
the gloom in their track. “Jack, he’s
started that racket again, don’t you know; and
any second we may get a slug in our belly, bustin’
things all to flinders. Try a razzle-dazzle on
the boob, old broncho!”</p>

<p class='c013'>So making a bank, Jack changed his course,
running at right angles, and if anything at a
faster pace than ever. Perk had the situation
“sized up to a fraction,” as he himself would
have called it; he realized that it was only
through the greatest of good luck they had escaped
being hit by one of those flying missiles;
and that so long as the mysterious enemy kept
using their ship for a flying target they were in
constant peril. Despite all this ducking and
dodging on Jack’s part he did not seem successful
in throwing the pursuing craft off the track.
To be sure the darkness was gradually growing
thicker with every passing minute, and this
seemed to be their only hope of crawling out of
a “hot hole,” according to Perk’s calculations.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk afterwards frankly admitted that he was
frothing at the mouth on account of finding himself
up against a situation where the cards
seemed stacked against him—where his hands
were tied as it were, and that reckless pilot, chasing
after them hell-bent, held all the trumps.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No use tryin’ that game any longer, Jack,
boy!” he yelled suddenly. “See the glim all
’round us, partner—sure as you live they’ve
even got some kind o’ a searchlight aboard, just
like they’d planned all this thing out beforehand.
Guess now it’s up to Little Perk to put
a plug into their game. Hold her steady a bit,
boss; I’m meaning to make ’em sit up an’ take
notice they can’t hog <i>all</i> the fun going. Watch
my smoke, Jack, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a delicate situation without any doubt;
for if those aboard that little Ryan plane, taking
advantage of the halo of light covering the craft
they followed, continued to make use of their
rapidfire gun, the danger of a hit had vastly increased;
but Perk must have some sort of scheme
in mind it was evident, or he would never have
asked his chum to steady the badly wobbling
boat when such action only doubled their peril.</p>

<p class='c013'>Calmly and deliberately, as though simply
bent on fetching down a deer he wanted for
his next camp supper, steady old Perk had his
faithful gun up to his shoulder, and was sighting
that piercing glare of light that marked the bow
of the pursuing aircraft, betraying the presence
of a searchlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Possibly owing to the clamor of their own
working motor Jack could not tell when his
companion unloosed a fusilade of shots; but he
did know that something suddenly changed the
situation, and to their advantage; for as though
a blanket had been tossed over the piercing
ray the illumination abruptly ceased, leaving
them to continue their wild flight shrouded in
encompassing darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, too, the sound of Perk’s exulting yell
was quite enough to tell the story of his success
in finding a glowing target for one of his several
missiles—the old sharpshooter had evidently
lost none of his cunning by reason of a lapse in
action.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Set ’em up in the other alley, boys—give your
Dutch uncle a chance to show an old trick or
two! Now <i>will</i> you be good, or must I give
you another smash in the jaw—better haul off
while the haulin’s good, fellers—I’d sure hate to
make you crack up, and fade out!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Even though his clever shot had doubtless
utterly smashed the searchlight, and put it out
of business, that bothersome rapidfire gun was
still in working order, as Perk discovered when
once more those insistent flashes, following closely
upon each others’ heels, announced a fresh
barrage, with the unseen, unheard hissing bullets
doubtless whizzing all around them.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was adding insult to injury, Perk was
doubtless telling himself, as he realized that his
lucky shot had after all failed to daunt that
stubborn pair in the speedy Ryan ship.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You <i>will</i> have it, seems like,” he growled
to himself; for since he had discarded his earphone
harness just previous to starting his late
“shooting spree,” Perk could no longer hold
intercourse with his fellow flyer; “all right then,
I’ll try some more o’ the same sorter medicine;
what’s good for the goose orter be fine for the
gander. Mind your eye now, boys, and keep
a tight grip on your chutes if anything happens
not down in your gamble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again did the continual flash of spitting fire
from the gun afford the sharpshooter in the
chased ship abundant opportunities for focussing
his aim; although instinct may have
taken the place of vision on Perk’s part.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fortunately Jack must have been expecting
something along those lines, knowing his companion
so well, and how he was always eager
to “repeat” when things were coming his way;
for he kept the flying boat wonderfully steady
just then, even though realizing how such action
doubled their own chances of being hit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was now shooting on general principles,
in hopes of being fortunate enough to find a
billet for one of his random bullets. He went
at the business with all the <i>sang froid</i> of a veteran
fighter, accustomed to meeting hostile
craft up in the wide air spaces, or even above
the clouds—all the fierce delight of matching
his skill and life against a foeman worthy of his
steel had once more gripped the old flying warrior;
and it may be for the moment he deluded
himself with the belief that this was but a reincarnation
of those never-to-be-forgotten days
when all Europe was held fast in the throes of
the grisly war-god.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly Perk ceased firing, nor was this
caused by the magazine of his repeating rifle
being empty—he had seen that the discharges
back yonder were no longer in full blast, showing
that something must have happened to cause
such a sudden cessation to hostilities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before he could attempt to analyze what this
might mean it was all flashed before his questioning
mind—a burst of flames came from the
spot where last he had seen the shadowy shape
of their persistent pursuer clipping through
space like a blazing meteor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk sat there doubled up, his mouth half
open, staring with might and main, as some
object began to drop toward the earth with ever
increasing speed—something which he knew
full well must of necessity be the beautiful little
Ryan plane, which he had admired so much
when at Candler Field at close of the late day,
and before this wild dash into the darkness of
night began.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently one of his missiles (fired with such
grim determination when he “took the bit in
his teeth,” and struck back) had found its mark,
and unleashed the dangerous contents of the
gasoline reservoir, with the splashing fluid instantly
catching fire from the exploding spark
of the running motor.</p>

<p class='c013'>No flyer ever saw his enemy going down in a
flaming coffin without feeling compassion gripping
him; that one moment had changed his
heart from bitter hatred to a sense of pity; knowing
as he must have done that the day might
be near at hand when he too would share in a
similar dreadful fate.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so Perk found himself all in a nervous
tremble as, laying down his gun, he managed
once more to adjust the head harness, so as to
be able to again hold communication with his
fellow adventurer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c014'>CHAPTER VI <br /> <br />PARACHUTE JUMPERS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Just then Jack hurriedly banked, and swung
around as though to double back on their late
course. This of course told Perk the pilot must
be already aware of the terrible tragedy that
was being enacted close at hand, and meant to
see its finish with his own eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the abrupt change in their course he
was in time to catch a glimpse of the flaming
object still spiraling earthwards, a billow of fire
that glowed suggestively in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then far below it seemed to strike the ground—they
heard no sound whatever, but the fire
became stationary; although increasing in fury,
since the wind created by its passage no longer
whipped the devouring flames. Evidently by
the time the conflagration stopped for want of
further material on which to feed, nothing inflammable
would be left of the once haughty
little Ryan masterpiece save the engine, and
other metal parts.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the big idea, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk asked this as a leader, wishing to get a
better grip on his own nerves, since they had
been dreadfully shocked at the dire result of his
random shot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Going to circle around a few times, and drop
down a bit,” came the illuminating reply;
“though I reckon it’s no use, since nothing could
live in all that awful blast.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe not, Jack,” remarked Perk, a bit
cheerily; “but there’s a fair chance neither o’
them guys got snagged in the flash o’ that gas.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Perk, have you some foundation
for saying that?” demanded the other, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure—they jumped all right, boss,” Perk
told him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You saw them do it then, did you, boy?”
continued Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They bailed out okay—I saw two take the
jump right after the first flash came—went down
like plummets in the bargain—smart lads those
guys are, I’m tellin’ you, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>No doubt Jack was glad to hear this bit of
news, for it had filled him with horror to realize
that in order to escape they had been compelled
to ruthlessly take human life. He was
much younger than Perk, veteran of the World
War, who had grown more or less hardened
to such happenings when staking his own life
against that of a tricky German air pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Still goin’ down, are you?” asked Perk shortly
afterwards, on finding that they were still
swinging around in a wide circle, that burning
pyre far below being the hub of the wheel of
which their boat was the outer tire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Might as well,” came the ready answer,
showing that Jack had made up his mind
hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess now they’ll get down somehow, boss;
a whole lot depends on what kind o’ landin’
they’ll be able to make—if its rocks, or trees,
they got to strike it’s apt to be some hard sleddin’
for the boys. Say, ’taint possible now you’re
fixin’ to try an’ lend ’em a helpin’ hand? I’d
hate to know they’d been wiped off the map in
that hot fire; but somehow I don’t feel like
playin’ the part o’ the Good Samaritan to such
man devils as them two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No danger of my trying to make a landing
where the chances are ten to one it just <i>can’t</i> be
done,” explained Jack, seeing that his companion
was almost ready to mutiny if any such mad
proceeding were contemplated. “I’d just feel
better if I knew they’d reached ground okay;
then we could keep on our way, and it’d be up
to them to get out of the scrape.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! I get you, partner,” grunted the relieved
Perk. “Don’t think I’m bitter about the
thing, ’cause they’re sure hot stuff all right; but
I’m a bit slow to accept that forgive and forget
stuff, specially after any guy’s tried his level
best to gimme a dirty deal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll try the thing out while on the job,”
Jack announced. “Our own wonderful escape
from meeting just that same kind of fate makes
me kind of soft. Perhaps we’ll not be able to
learn a single thing; you know how it often is
when you’ve finally struck ground after quitting
the ship by the chute route—all out of breath—sometimes
knocked up a bit, if you escape broken
bones—not any shape to shout, or do anything
but just lie there, and suck in the air in big
gasps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, that’s right for you, old hoss,” Perk
readily agreed. “Me, I once got a collar bone
smashed that way. No harm in our makin’ a
few swings around these diggin’s ’fore we put
out for Orleans. That fire keeps burnin’ like
things they got sprinkled right well with the
juice when the tank blew up. Go to it, Jack,
just as you please, never mindin’ a few squeals
from a hard-boiled guy like Perk Perkiser.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m going to shut down on the engine, and
take a little glide, so we can pick up anything
like a yell,” announced the pilot a minute later.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to it—duck then, boy!” snapped Perk,
as he temporarily relieved himself of his ear-phones
in order to catch anything bordering on
a shout from the ground below.</p>

<p class='c013'>The simple expedient was carried out successfully,
and when once again they leveled out,
to continue circling, Jack asked eagerly:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get anything, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a bleat, partner,” replied the other, who
had hurriedly held his earphones in position so
as to cover the emergency.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sorry for that, but we’ll try a couple more
times before calling it all off,” suggested Jack,
who could be more or less persistent when the
occasion arose for such action, though never
carrying it so far as to be reckless.</p>

<p class='c013'>So a dozen seconds or so afterwards he again
gave warning that it was time for another drop
of a few hundred feet—not that they meant to
take any chances by getting too close to the unknown
terrain lying in the pitch blackness under
the flying ship; but simply to be able to listen
with the horrid clamor of the bustling engine
momentarily stilled.</p>

<p class='c013'>No better success followed this second maneuvre—all
was deathly silent around, above,
below, as though never a solitary living human
being existed within miles of the spot where
the destruction of the Ryan monoplane had
taken place.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll give a third and last try,” was Jack’s
announced decision, to which Perk added:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Three times, and batter’s out—by then I rather
guess we’ll be down close enough to the solid
ground to make another drop dangerous. Either
way I’m satisfied we’ve done the right thing,
old hoss. Suit yourself when you see fit to
coast,” whereupon he once more denuded his
ears of the exceedingly useful and really indispensable
phone harness, to await the occasion
of the last try in the line of an aviator’s
duty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it, Perk?—get a whisper?”</p>

<p class='c013'>They had completed the glide, and were once
more on a level course, with Jack even turning
the nose of the ship a bit heavenward; since
neither of them knew what the nature of the
ground below must be—whether some hill lay
directly ahead, against which they might smash
for a complete wipeout.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! a heap more’n that, partner!” came
the triumphant reply. “Heard a shout, an’ then
another some distance off—struck me both
jumpers had lit okay, and were tryin’ to communicate,
so’s to get together again. Guess
things ain’t so bad after all with them guys, an’
we c’n be movin’ on our way without botherin’
any more ’bout their safety. Some two-legged
varmints seem to be watched over by Old Satan
hisself, they bein’ that venomous, and evil-minded.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack made no rejoinder to this remark, tinged
with bitterness as it was, only pointed the nose
of his craft upward, and started to spiral for
altitude. Undoubtedly he was feeling greatly
relieved because of their having escaped so
miraculously from the hovering peril; and best
of all managed to turn the tables on those who
would have encompassed their destruction just
in order to defend the lawless game in which
they were engaged in connection with Slippery
Slim.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk must have been doing a little hard thinking
as the time passed and they raced on their
way, for later on he started to speak; and as
usual his line of chatter told that he was seeking
information, trying to find a solution of
certain exasperating puzzles that were “twisting
his intellects,” as he himself described
matters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Things kind o’ got me goofy, partner, an’
I’d like you to raise the curtain some, if so be
you feel so bent. First place I guess it goes
without questionin’ that these huskies must be
in cohunks with that there big gun, Slippery
Slim Garrabrant?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! that’s a dead certainty—who else would
have any reason for waylaying us in Atlanta,
and setting up this trap for us to fall into?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! then it stands to reason, boss, he’s
got means for findin’ out what the Secret Service
aims to do; an’ so has been able to play the boys
for suckers every time they set out to lay him
by the heels, eh, Jack, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s past history, Perk; even the Big Boss
got wise to it, and tried everything possible to
learn where the great leak happened; but our
experience proves they haven’t discovered it so
far. I’m making up my mind that the closer
we draw to the headquarters of this rotten clique
of crime, where they make the bogus long-green
that’s been flooding the whole West for a year
and more, why, the harder our job is bound
to be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which tickles me a heap, boy—I’m just
yearnin’ for comin’ to grips with that gazaboo
o’ a Slim; and now we’re on to the job I’ll never
be happy ’till he’s on his way to that big Government
pen we glimpsed in Atlanta, where
some other lads we helped to pinch are doin’
time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if you keep on as you’ve started, Perk,
we’ll flatten the whole gang like pancakes—they’ve
stacked up against a new sort of revenue
dog when they started a shooter of your calibre
on the trail. First you smashed their searchlight,
and then sent a chuck of lead into the
gas tank that broke up the game. That’s the
kind of a pinch hitter you are, partner; and
right now I want to congratulate you on such
dandy marksmanship.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lay off that stuff, Jack—nothin’ but great
luck fetched the bacon home for this lad. But
me, I’m shakin’ hands with myself ’cause I
had that hunch a bear gun mightn’t be such a
bad thing to tote along on a trip that’s goin’ to
carry us across the border, an’ into Old Mex,
like as not; where the greasers are sometimes
tough nuts an’ hard to handle they tell me.
’Spose we’ll run across them two hill billies
again, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wouldn’t surprise me a bit if we did,” replied
the pilot, leveling off at a three thousand
foot ceiling, and still heading due southwest.
“Like as not they’ve got plenty of ready cash
along; and after having been so cleverly upset in
their calculations, due to your beating them silly
with a barrage of hot lead, they’ll be hot to wipe
out their disgrace. Oh! yes, we’re going to run
up against that foxey pair again before the book
is closed for keeps.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c014'>CHAPTER VII <br /> <br />STRIKING THE FOG BELT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>With the stars shining brightly above them,
and a moon just past its full climbing the eastern
heavens, having dissipated the darkness of the
earlier part of the night, Jack and his fellow
voyager continued plunging along in a very
satisfactory fashion, having no reason for feeling
further concern regarding the peril to
which they had been so lately subjected.</p>

<p class='c013'>But things were not destined to continue so
comfortably for the two adventurers, it seemed.
Perk was just congratulating himself for about
the fourth time at having such a comfortable
flight, when he sat up and took notice of the
fact that those heavenly bodies were beginning
to look exceedingly hazy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Danged shame, that’s what, to spoil such a
dandy night!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What ails you now?” demanded Jack, on
hearing the other make this little remark that
bespoke exasperation at least; “another boat on
our tail?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I guess not just now,” replied Perk,
scoffingly; “one was more’n enough for a single
jump. But we’re agoin’ to run into a pesky
fog belt, sure as you’re born, old hoss!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That all?” laughed the other, who apparently
saw nothing of particular consequence
about such a common happening; “it may perhaps
manage to slow us down more or less; but
what does that matter, when we’ve got time to
burn. The Big Boss told us, remember, not to
hurry things at all—plenty of time, oodles of
money, and any backing we chose to call for in
the way of a new boat, or more helpers. We
should worry, old scout!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Tain’t that in peticular Jack,” complained
the other; “but of all things a sky detective’s got
to run smack up against, fog’s the one I despise
most. It’s got me in bad more’n a few times, so
I’ve grown to look on the peasoup stuff like it
was my—er, what-dye-call it—Nebraska, no, I
mean Nemesis.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, now you mention it, Perk, I remember
you telling me something about that strange feeling
you have creep over you. No need for you
to apologize—in my knocking around among airmen
I’ve found that often even the most daring
and reckless in the bunch had some kind of a
weakness, if only you looked far enough under
the surface; just as sometimes you’ll find a boasting
bully actually afraid of his little wife at
home, who’s smacked him with her handy rolling
pin many a time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! wasn’t I a canvas man ’long with a
travelin’ circus a wheen o’ years ago, an’ didn’t
I see the biggest elephant in captivity rear up
on his hind legs, lift his trunk sky-high in the
air, an’ squeal like fun just when a little half
grown mouse happened to run along near his
alley. Well, I’m the tusker, an’ fog is the
mouse, as you might say—we never do get on
well as a combine. Hope it hugs the ground,
an’ leaves us a clear track up among the clouds
I c’n see creepin’ up ahead yonder.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Doesn’t bother me a whit, partner; don’t
forget we’ve got that new radio beacon aboard
to try out; and if it’s as clever as I’ve heard tell
it’ll carry us along our route to Orleans through
the thickest nest of fog anybody ever stacked up
against. Naturally we can’t expect to get the
full benefit of its capacity to hold a speeding
plane on its true course; because the invention’s
hardly more than half baked up to now; but I
set it according to directions, and if at any time
we begin to slide off our course the light that
springs up is bound to give warning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A bully good layout I’d say, if it c’n do what
they claim,” ventured Perk, who undoubtedly
had read certain things concerning the new invention,
and was eager to learn just how it would
pan out. “You showed a level head, partner,
when you decided to take the offer o’ that gent
in Atlanta, and try the thing out. Guess, then,
I needn’t bother my head ’bout gettin’ astray;
if things keep bein’ invented it ain’t goin’ to be
very long till a pilot’ll get slapped good an’
hard if he misses runnin’ on a straight line, or
even veers from his proper course in a great big
blow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re living in a machine age, Perk, and
every day things are heading that way on the
run—electric helps in kitchen, factory, and even
aboard our air cruisers. While the brainwork
and strain grow harder the actual manual labor
is lessened all the time. But as you say it’s getting
a bit hazy, and chances are we’re in for a
spell of blue fog.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Ten minutes afterwards there could not be
the least doubt concerning that fact, for by degrees
even the stars vanished from view, ditto
the gorgeous round moon. Still, since the sky
remained brighter in the east, it was not at all
difficult to tell where the fair mistress of the
Southern night had hidden her face behind the
opaque veil.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was now flying by instruments alone,
since never a thing could be seen by the keenest
eye above, below—they seemed to be hung in
unlimited space; but pushing along with considerable
speed just the same, bound for the distant
city on the vast Mississippi, situated not so
very far from its delta.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus passed a full hour.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly Perk saw a small light spring into
view on one side of the plane, and it certainly
electrified him considerably.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hi! there, partner, we’re off our track—shifted
to the east, seems like, unless I’m away
wrong in sizin’ things up ’cordin’ to Hoyle.
Got to swing her to the larboard-watch side, I
kinder guess—how ’bout that, boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You hit it that time, Perk, and here she goes
to climb back to our true course. Worked just
as we figured it would, and put us wise to a fact
we’d hardly have picked up in any other way.
I reckon now this same radio beacon’s bound to
turn out a great help to the poor badgered air
pilot, flying blind when fog hides the ground
beacons, and he gets no aid from the heavens
above.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll say it’s the best thing I’ve struck for a
long time,” affirmed the delighted Perk.
“There she goes—the glim I mean—closed shop,
havin’ ’complished the business set for her;
showing we must have struck our real course
again.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Easy money,” laughed Jack, just as well satisfied.
“Makes a fellow sit up and try to guess
what the next big idea connected with aviation
will prove to be; doesn’t seem to be any limit to
the dazzling discoveries these scientific chaps’ll
turn out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, partner—like that big chute they’re
trying out, which they claim will keep any
plane from crashing—if the engine goes dead
all you got to do is to press a little button, and
when the drop comes open goes the monster umbrella,
able to hold you and the crate suspended
in the air, to gradually fall to the earth like the
colored balls from a bursted skyrocket. Great
stunt that, an’ I’m livin’ in hopes it’ll be my
luck to some day find myself aboard a ship that’s
equipped with such a giant chute, an’ have the
glorious experience of seeing the thing work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack seemed to consider it the part of wisdom
to pull up more or less, as they were in no hurry,
and could drop down on the aviation field at
New Orleans by dawn, even though they concluded
to just “loaf along.” Disliking anything
pertaining to fog Perk naturally said nothing
to hint at a desire for further speed; besides
his own good sense told him that what his mate
had just said with regard to no necessity existing
for haste, was sound logic, and a due regard
for “safety first.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So the time slipped away, with midnight finding
them past the meridian of their projected
flight. Perk had long since subsided and
seemed content to sit there in the double cockpit,
letting his thoughts roam back to the exciting
developments of the earlier night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Years had elapsed since last he watched a
doomed plane writhing and twisting in its death
agonies, with the flames wrapping it in an envelope—a
blazing coffin speeding headlong to a
final crash; and here, strange to say, after all
that time intervening he had again passed
through a similar experience. Now that he had
an opportunity to calmly review the happening,
Perk admitted he was pleased to know the two
occupants of the Ryan cockpit had apparently
escaped a miserable fate that must have been
laid at his door.</p>

<p class='c013'>Two A. M. and all’s well!</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk figured that when a few more times
sixty minutes had passed it would be time for
them to catch a first glimpse of the great rolling
turgid stream that could, when the heavy rains
united with the melting snows up in the mountains
of the Far West, create vast floods that
placed much of the low country along the river
under many feet of water. It had been a long
time since last Perk had set eyes on the Mississippi,
and hence he was considerably worked
up over the prospect of soon glimpsing the
mighty flood.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c014'>CHAPTER VIII <br /> <br />NEW ORLEANS—FIRST STOP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“There she rolls, Jack, old boy—the greatest
stream in the whole U.S.A.—I swan if she
don’t look just as fine as when I glimpsed her
for the first time many years ago!”</p>

<p class='c013'>That was Perk’s tribute on beholding the
Lower Mississippi perhaps thirty miles above
New Orleans; he displayed almost as much enthusiasm
as those early discoverers did centuries
back, when their distended eyes took in the
mighty sweep of the flood rolling down toward
its junction with the Mexican Gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was early dawn, and the fog bank had been
dissipated by a fresh breeze acting as advance
courier to the rising of the sun. Jack, looking
toward the southwest could also see the object
of his companion’s exultation, and undoubtedly
felt some of the same pleasure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When it gets a bit lighter we’ll have a far distant
view of the city, with its smoke cloud hovering
over it,” he remarked, knowing that soft coal
and southern pine as used for fuel in the Fall
and Winter seasons always caused something of
a pall to mark the site of the river metropolis.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk reached around, and drew forth a case
that on being opened disclosed a pair of pretty
decent binoculars, with which they had been
fitted out by the Washington authorities before
starting on this particular man-hunt, with an
idea that they might prove most useful sooner
or later.</p>

<p class='c013'>After clapping these to his eyes Perk announced
that he could easily pick up the goal
of their flight from Candler Field; although the
smoke did act as a screen, through which it was
not possible to see with certainty.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was now bringing out all the reserve
speed of their ship—it was of some consequence
that they make a landing as early as possible,
since he had no desire to attract undue attention,
and possibly have inquisitive newspaper reporters
to be asking pertinent questions as to
whence they came, what their identities might
be when at home, and also concerning the object
of their coming to New Orleans. Secrecy
was the foundation on which they meant to
build their plans; and from their previous experience
with those dare devils in the employ of
Slippery Slim, too much care could not be employed
in order to mask their batteries.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, too, as they approached the city Jack was
dropping down to lower levels; while on his part
Perk skimmed the whole scene, looking for the
airport they knew to be somewhere within reach
of their vision.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being presently located he called his
chum’s attention to the open field, and in almost
no time they were circling it, looking for the
best place to land.</p>

<p class='c013'>Early though it was there were moving figures
circulating around, while some sort of ship
was coming in from over the river—possibly one
of the air mail carriers from a distant station, it
might be many hundred miles away, fetching
Uncle Sam’s important letter sacks, and worthwhile
express matter, at treble the speed that the
fastest train could muster.</p>

<p class='c013'>The landing was effected without the slightest
difficulty, and hardly had their boat come
to a stop than a number of persons, most of them
connected with the ground force of mechanicians
and hostlers, surrounded the incoming
craft, paying but scant attention to the air mail,
which dropped down almost at the same moment—that
was a daily happening, a following
out of a regular schedule, to which they had
become accustomed; while the arrival of a mysterious
plane might stand for almost anything.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold fast, Perk!” said Jack, as he took off
his headphones, and raising his voice to almost
a shout, so deaf did he appear after a whole
night’s run; “don’t tumble out yet; and keep a
muffler on your gab, for we’ve got to let ’em
take it out in guessing. I’ll soon see if the
party we’re expecting to meet is on hand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He still kept his helmet and goggles in position
as he thrust his head out of the cockpit, and
raising his right hand with two fingers extended,
made a species of salute. A stout man,
with a very red face, and an air of importance,
immediately pushed through the gathering
crowd, and answered Jack’s signal with a similar
sweep of his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s okay, Perk—that’s our party, and he’s
been watching for us, showing he had my wire
last evening. Get a move on, and we’ll soon be
doubling our legs under a breakfast table.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! but that will be a joy to me,
old hoss!” Perk exclaimed; “’cause I’m as
hungry as a wolf, an’ the smell o’ coffee is apt
to set me wild. Go to it, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was paying no attention to these vaporings,
since it was a common occurrence to have
old Perk declare the bottom of his stomach was
in danger of falling out—he had met the red-faced
gentleman and they were shaking hands
as they exchanged a few words.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all fixed, comrade,” he said to Perk over
his shoulder, mentioning no names lest suspicious
ears catch them, and thus have a clue as
to their identity; “we’ll get a few of these boys
to run our boat into a hangar close by, which is
waiting for us, and then cut out for the city—and grub.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This being speedily carried out, with the
doors fastened securely, and the two flyers began
to hastily divest themselves of their working
“duds.” Before ten minutes had passed
they were on their way in a taxi the gentleman
friend had brought out, with Jack and their
host talking at a great rate; while as for Perk
he was looking out, and finding more or less enjoyment
in seeing new and novel sights along
the road.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk having been well coached as to the
necessity for caution, made it a practice to snatch
an occasional glance in their rear, looking for
any signs to indicate that their car was being
trailed; but nothing at all suspicious came to
his attention.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meantime Jack had learned that their new
friend (whose name he already knew to be Mr.
Adkins) was connected with the Administration
forces of the United States District Attorney,
having offices in the Government building—that
he had been secretly advised of their coming
days before receiving Jack’s wire; and was
ready to give them all the information possible
concerning what had been learned in connection
with the wholesale operations of the man they
had been sent out to cage, so as to effectually
remove the greatest menace that had threatened
business men of the Southwest in a decade.</p>

<p class='c013'>In due time he would post them regarding
all these important facts; meanwhile they
could take things easy, for there was no hurry,
and the game was of too much importance to
allow lax methods. When they got good and
ready they could make a start, and after that
everything must depend on their ability to beat
Slippery Slim at his favorite game of “dog eat
dog.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He steered his guests to a certain restaurant
where he knew they could be well taken care
of, and which turned out to be close to the hotel
at which they booked under fictitious names.
Here Perk was given the privilege of ordering
just what he desired along the line of rashers of
bacon and fried eggs; cornbread with syrup;
several cups of coffee taken black; and to top off
with, a Havana cigar such as he was not accustomed
to smoking, being addicted to the more
friendly pipe habit.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no talk of shop while they partook
of breakfast; such business as they had to transact
was of too delicate a nature to be discussed
in a public place, where strangers would be
coming and going, and spying eyes might be on
them every minute of the time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Later they gathered in the room at the hotel
where, behind closed and locked doors they felt
free to confer in lowered tones.</p>

<p class='c013'>Much had to be told, and numerous thrilling
accounts brought out connected with adventures
experienced by other Secret Service men in their
efforts to round up the notorious gang—all of
which had resulted in absolute defeat for the
Government agents.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shrewd men some of these parties undoubtedly
were, with a record of numerous famous
cases successfully carried through; but somehow
when they found themselves up against
Slippery Slim Garrabrant they sooner or later
fell down on the job, and had to be recalled.</p>

<p class='c013'>In fact, it was disclosed to Jack and his pal,
two different agents were never again heard
from, after secret code messages had been received
from them to the effect that they were
even then getting very close to a great discovery
that must end in the arrest of the malefactor—a
dead silence that had never been broken
seemed to signify that they must have fallen into
some sort of fiendish trap, possibly meeting with
a gruesome fate that would be forever shrouded
in blank mystery.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins, watching closely as he narrated
these uncomfortable facts, was pleased to see
that neither of his interested auditors displayed
the least sign of being disturbed, showing that
they had long since discounted everything along
this line.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c014'>CHAPTER IX <br /> <br />COACHING PERK</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Of course it was in keeping with this exchange
of confidences that Jack should relate all that
had happened to them since their arrival in
Atlanta to secure the ship awaiting them, load
it to capacity for a long voyage, and finally start
off from Candler Field.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins listened eagerly to this modest
account of what had already happened to them
as a starter in the hunt they had undertaken;
and he was visibly thrilled at hearing of the
bitter night chase, the desperate tactics undertaken
by the pair of human wolves aboard the
Ryan monoplane; and particularly when Jack
finally described in vivid language the astounding
act of Perk in first shattering the bothersome
searchlight, to follow this with his lucky
random shot that bore into the gas tank of the
pursuing craft and brought about an explosion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Possibly the urbane gentleman had never in
all his life listened to so ghastly a true story as
the graphic one thus modestly related by one
of the two participants; looking at them, with
Jack so calm and modest, giving all the credit
to his grinning accomplice, he must have decided
in his astute mind that at last Slippery
Slim was going to have a pair of human bloodhounds
on his trail such as all his ingenuity and
vindictiveness combined could not throw into
the discard.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me have,” he went on to say to Jack, “as
good a description as possible of those same
bills your friend Scotty found in that pocketbook
dropped among his clothing by the unknown
party whom you believe was looking for
your letter of instructions from Washington.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When Jack complied with this request the
other nodded his head approvingly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question but what they were of the same
stripe as all the others that have been brought to
our attention,” he told Jack. “You must know
it’s been a mooted question as to whether the
plates from which these notes are being printed
in vast quantities (that make it a gold mine for
the gang) are counterfeits engraved by some
master in the art or stolen property, which have
somehow never been missed by the plant where
much of the printing is done for the Treasury
Department—the bills are so perfect that cashiers
and tellers are all at sea over the facts, so
that something of a near panic has resulted in
banking circles as a result of this unknown quantity.
Remember these are the old type of banknotes,
and not the new abbreviated form of currency,
so that it is more difficult to discover the
actual facts.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will all come out in the wash, sir,” remarked
Perk, sagaciously, with a sly wink at
his pal.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, Perk,” observed the gentlemanly official,
smilingly; “but I’m more concerned about
your plan of campaign than anything else right
now. During the time you stop over here in
Orleans I mean to keep you posted with regard
to any fresh news that comes in to Headquarters
for there is hardly a day when we do not learn
of additional discoveries connected with this deluge
of phony money that’s been dumped on the
whole Southwest by this hard working gang.
I am telling you everything that’s known or suspected,
so that you can figure out your best line
of action.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We understand that, Mr. Adkins,” said Jack,
nodding, “and you can rest assured we appreciate
your kindness more than I can tell you.
Before we jump off you will know what we’ve
decided to do, so as to pick up a warm trail;
and after that, sir, don’t be worried if you fail
to hear a single word from us for days, weeks,
or even months; but depend upon it we’ll be
working on the job every minute.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And never forget, I beg of you, that this
man is a devil for cruelty and craftiness—I’m
sure you’ll not delude yourselves that his arrest
will be an easy task; for as good men as were
ever on the roll of our Secret Service Department
have fallen down on the job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you again, sir, for your warning; but
we’re not meaning to feel anything like over-confidence,
so as to let the bars down. I understand
from my having been picked to take up
this case, that the knowledge of myself and my
assistant here along the line of aviation cut a big
figure in the appointment, since it has been
learned that Slim himself makes use of a flying
boat possibly to cross over from the wilds of
Mexico, it being suspected he has his plant
hidden away somewhere among the mountains,
where he doubtless keeps peace with the authorities
by paying tribute that insures his being left
undisturbed. We hope to change all that sooner
or later, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I admire your modesty, Jack,” continued the
Government official, who had warmed toward
the pair during the short time he had known
them, and seemed to take a personal interest in
their fortunes. “Remember to keep in touch
with Headquarters while in the city, so as to
notify me in case you need any assistance—I can
later on place a posse of oldtime Texas Rangers
at your service, if the occasion arises for a necessity
to show force—they are now working for
the Government as border patrols, and as you
can understand, are the same rough-riding, fearless
type that played such a leading figure in
the early history of the Lone Star State; for we
have authority that covers such matters. And
I’ll be one of the first to extend you my hearty
congratulations should you win out, and bring
in your man; as I’ve no doubt your good pal
here used to do when, as you’ve told me, he used
to work with the Canadian Mounted Police
force, in years gone by.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It won’t be our fault, sir, if we make a flop
o’ the job,” asserted Perk, who believed he ought
to get in an occasional word; although there
were a good many things he did not wholly
understand, and which he would depend on
Jack to further explain when opportunity arose.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins shook them both cordially by the
hand, and took his departure, leaving them to
digest all the startling facts he had placed in
their possession. By slow degrees they would
figure things out, and sketch their plan of operation;
then would come the hour when once more
they must depend on their wings to carry them
many hundreds of miles toward the scene of
action, where the air would be surcharged with
dynamite, while deadly enemies might be lying
in ambush, ready to take them by surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk started to spring his questions, and Jack
was only too glad to make the necessary explanations;
for it was necessary that they work in
complete harmony if they hoped to be successful.</p>

<p class='c013'>As far as they had gone, things looked hopeful
to Jack, as he marshalled the facts that had
lately been placed in their possession. He was
satisfied that when every item had been arranged
in its rightful sequence they could fashion a
plan of campaign that would at least have a
better chance for winning out than any of those
utilized by former detectives, who had not possessed
the essential wings so as to meet Slippery
Slim on his own chosen ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No tellin’ just how long we’ll stick it out in
this burgh, I guess, buddy?” suggested Perk,
some time later, as they continued to take things
easy, resting up after a hard night’s flight, and
meaning to get around the city after noon and
lunch time had come and passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Couldn’t say as yet, Perk; we’ve got to comb
out the stuff as handed over by our new friend,
Mr. Adkins, and discard everything that doesn’t
pan out as being worth while. Then there were
a few leaders he dropped that, if followed up,
might turn out to be leading clues, the possession
of which would possibly turn the tide of battle.
I’m meaning not to let anything make me show
undue speed—Rome wasn’t built in a day, we’ve
got to recollect, and so shape things from the
standpoint of ‘safety first’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! that’s the boy!” gurgled the pleased
Perk; “me, don’t I remember that story o’ the
hare an’ the tortoise runnin’ a race, which the
turtle won ’cause he never even stopped to rest
up; while the rabbit, thinkin’ he could run loops
around such a plodder, lay down to take a nap,
overslept himself, and when he got to the goal
there was Old Leatherback awaitin’ to turn the
big laugh on him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk wound up with one of his rollicking
laughs; everything seemed to create merriment
in his soul just now, after that royal breakfast;
though perhaps he was running away ahead of
the dry facts, and counting his chickens before
they were hatched out of the shell. But Perk
was confident the sly fox of a Slim would find
himself snagged in the net one of these days,
and the clever guy who handled things would
turn out to be an aviator and sky detective named
Jack Ralston.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack some time afterwards, had just aroused
from a short nap, when Perk, who had been
pondering and grumbling to himself, tossed out
another question, as if to disclose what was
troubling him:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it, old hoss, do you b’lieve them
dicks we left behind after they’d floated down
from a high ceilin’ with their chutes, got outen
the scrape, so they could a hiked to some nearby
village or town, an’ took the first train headed
for Orleans, reckonin’ we must a’been on the
jump thisaways?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say the chances all point that way, Perk,”
Jack told him, without the slightest hesitation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jumpin’ crickets! if that’s a fact why, a feller
might run acrost the slick pair any old minute—meet
’em right face to face!” Perk went on to
say, as if the fact gave him more or less concern.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose then you’d recognize the chappies
with just one look, eh, what about that, partner?”
asked Jack, laughingly; at which the other
grinned a bit foolishly, to admit he had serious
doubts on that score.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! didn’t either o’ us get a peep-in at
their monikers, worse luck—had them helmets
and goggles in place right away, like they didn’t
mean to give us a single look-in. S’pose now
they got the high sign on us boys?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“On a venture I’d say that was always possible,”
replied Jack, soberly; for this very point
had occurred to him, and was as yet unsettled
in his mind. “Nobody knows how long they may
have been in Atlanta—Mr. Adkins assured us
Slim seemed to have all sorts of strings out, so
as to learn in advance of any bunch of Government
agents taking the field against his giant
bogus money monopoly; and for all we can tell
those two may have been spying on us most
of the time we were around Candler Field, getting
our ship ready to take to the air.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rotten luck, I’m sayin’, and too much one-sided
to suit me,” growled Perk, frowning savagely.
“Here we got to do our work in the
dark; while that smart cuss holds all the high
cards in the pack, an’ c’n trump our ace any
time he takes a notion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No need to worry about that, comrade,” said
Jack, soothingly. “You must remember that
when we move along we mean to disappear as
if heading into the thickest belt of pea soup fog
ever seen—in that way they’ll lose all trace of
us, and we can play our cards as we choose, making
up for a different breed of sky travelers, so
as to dope the cleverest kind of spies he can send
out. While they’re left guessing what’s become
of us we’ll be doing our little tracking job, and
hour by hour, day after day, keep on creeping
closer to their secret stronghold, wherever that
may prove to be. Those are some of the things
we figured on doing, Perk, don’t forget.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The one addressed made no reply, but as he
let his head fall back, as if he meant to pick up
a few winks of sleep, there came a look of rapt
admiration on his weather-beaten face that bespoke
the utmost confidence in his best pal.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c014'>CHAPTER X <br /> <br />LAYING PLANS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>After a noonday lunch Jack and his partner
spent most of the afternoon in carrying out the
various duties that were seemingly on their program.
Among other things Jack visited the
Federal building, and was closeted for more
than an hour with Mr. Adkins.</p>

<p class='c013'>The latter official had conceived a great fancy
for young Ralston, and went to no end of trouble
so as to post him with regard to what he was
likely to run up against while endeavoring to
close in on Slippery Slim. With his accustomed
sagacity Jack made notes of some of the
facts thus laid before him; but since these were
in shorthand, and would be utterly unintelligible
to any outside party, should they chance
to fall into enemy hands, there was no danger
that any mischief would follow.</p>

<p class='c013'>By degrees he was filling up with scraps of
description, and everything connected with
former attempts at locating the hideout, where
all this unlawful scrip was being turned off the
press, to flood the Southwest.</p>

<p class='c013'>That was always his way of doing—when
given a tough job Jack would live alongside it,
breathing the very atmosphere of the undertaking,
until he found himself sympathetic with the
aims and ambitions of the criminals whose apprehension
was placed on his shoulders by his
Big Boss.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll have dinner early, Perk,” he told the
other, who had been carrying out a number of
special duties while Jack was busy elsewhere,
“so as to retire to our room at the hotel. No
going out after nightfall for us just at present,
especially in a strange city, where some sneak
might waylay us coming back from the theater.
All that sort of pleasure must be put out of our
heads just at present.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! guess you’re hittin’ the nail on the
head, old hoss, when you say that,” grunted
Perk, who very probably had already picked out
just the screen play he wanted so badly to see;
but he was a good scout, and able to put duty
above pleasure, when the occasion arose for
making a personal sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another thing,” continued Jack, “there’s no
telling what night flying we’re bound to be up
against, in trying to keep our movements secret;
so it’d be wise for us both to enjoy all the extra
sleep that comes our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, partner,” assented Perk, subordinating
his desires to the slogan which he knew
was Jack’s watchword—“safety first”. “When
I’ve stowed away all the grub I c’n hold mebbe
I’ll be ready to hit the hay, to stick it out till
cock-crow around daylight—an’ then some.
Pretty fair sleeper, they always called me across
the big pond—crawl out as the last horn was
blowin’, rub my eyes a bit, get aboard my fightin’
crate, an’ step off to knock another Heine pilot
down afore botherin’ ’bout my breakfast—all in a
day’s doings with Gabe Perkiser. Sabbe that,
partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I know you like a book,” Jack told him
with a smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get a bellyfull when you had that confab
with Mr. Adkins?” demanded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m filled up to the brim with all kinds of
material, which by degrees I’ll have to sort out,
keeping only what strikes me as essential,” came
the answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see—sorter separatin’ the chaff from the
wheat,” mused Perk; “an’ if it’s a fair question,
old hoss, which way do we head when we take
off?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You might call it due northeast,” Jack told
him; and then, as his companion uttered a
startled exclamation, as though vastly surprised,
Jack gave a quick glance around as if to make
certain that no one was dogging their footsteps,
after which he lowered his voice almost to a
whisper, to add: “but that would be only for a
<i>blind</i>, in case hostile eyes were watching our
departure from the flying field; for after we’ve
cleared a dozen or more miles we can make a
complete circle, and point the nose of our boat
squarely west!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good boy!” snapped the relieved Perk;
“sounds a heap more like it. You sure did
throw a big scare into me, Jack, ’cause it’d been
’bout settled ’tween us that the game had ought
to be played out there in the boundless waste
spaces around the border.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, everything points that way so far,” he
was assured; “but no more talkie at present,
Perk—we’ll keep bottled up until inside four
walls, where no spy can steal our thunder.
Slim’s knocked the underpinning away from a
bunch of fine schemes looking to his undoing,
simply by finding out what the big game happened
to be, and then bursting the bubble by a
scoop. We don’t intend to dish our business
that way if it can be helped.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wall,” drawled Perk, with his best Yankee
effect, “guess not if we know our stuff, an’ c’n
roll our hoop.”</p>

<p class='c013'>As they walked along toward their hotel Perk
kept up a constant lookout, as though endeavoring
to make some more or less thrilling discovery—never
a man, black or white, did they meet
but that he was made the object of a severe
scrutiny by the suspicious one; however, they
reached their objective without his having run
across any reason for making a decision; and
shortly afterwards they were securely lodged in
their room, the door locked, and a couple of easy
chairs inviting them to take things comfortable,
which they lost no time in doing, being wearied
from so much trotting about—flying men as a
rule not enjoying a reputation for pedestrian
feats.</p>

<p class='c013'>A long and serious confab followed, both
speaking in low tones; Jack on his part explained
the mass of information he had accumulated,
and answered the flood of questions asked
by his comrade, as well as he was able; until he
found a chance to go deeper into things himself
he could not make definite statements concerning
a number of points that were a bit hazy, and
needed confirmation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus the afternoon waned, and the time came
when they were ready to think of the essential
“eats”. Of course it was Perk who brought this
subject up, for he chanced to have a tremendous
appetite, and was apt to give considerable time
to figuring what his next <i>menu</i> would be—indeed,
half the enjoyment in his estimation lay in
thus building air castles along the line of “grub”.</p>

<p class='c013'>Remembering that little episode up in Atlanta,
where some unknown party had made such
a “rat’s nest” of Scotty’s adjoining room, evidently
under a mistaken belief it belonged to
himself and Perk, Jack made sure to carry all
his important papers on his person, properly secured,
so that no deft hand of a sneak thief could
negotiate their abstraction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All ready, partner,” he told Perk, at the time
looking out of the window, holding back the
curtains to see the better who chanced to be
walking along the opposite pavement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never said sweeter words than them, old
boy; I sure was close to faintin’, my tummy
feelin’ like the bottom was adroppin’ out—soup
an’ such soft stuffs, while fillin’ at the time don’t
stay with me any great while—I crave solids
mostly. On your way then, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had marshalled all the facts that had
been placed in his possession, weeded a few out
as worthless, and by the time their discussion
ended had told his companion that the Finger
of Destiny was pointing out their future course
as lying over the almost boundless plains of
Texas, across New Mexico, and deep into Arizona
deserts, to the wild country along the border
not far distant from the spot at which the
Gila river forms a junction with the larger Colorado;
where the latter serves as a watery boundary
line between Arizona and Southeastern California,
with Old Mexico less than thirty miles
distant as the crow flies.</p>

<p class='c013'>It would be a big jump for them, but the flood
of bad currency undoubtedly had its start somewhere
in this hostile region, and spread out like
an open fan, northwest into San Diego and Los
Angeles—northward up to Salt Lake City—and
in the northeast as far as Oklahoma. To
effectually break it up it was necessary that they
go to the fountain head, so as to destroy the very
roots of the noisome poison ivy plant.</p>

<p class='c013'>They spent more than half an hour dining,
and needless to say Perk enjoyed himself to his
heart’s content—who wouldn’t if he had a pocketfull
of ready cash, furnished by a bountiful
Uncle Sam; a bill of fare bristling with all kinds
of tempting dishes such as Perk doted on; and
to complete the combination having been born
with a healthy, unbridled appetite?</p>

<p class='c013'>It was just commencing to get dusk when they
emerged from the restaurant and started back to
the hotel, some two blocks distant. Perk, as
usual, kept turning his head this way and that
very much like a wolf scalp-hunter looking for
his suspicious quarry. Presently he picked at
Jack’s sleeve, and bending his head until his lips
almost touched the other’s ear he observed in a
sibilant whisper!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen, partner—we got a clam doggin’ us
like a bloodhound on the track o’ a runaway nigger
from a convict camp back in Alabam—get
that, do you?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c014'>CHAPTER XI <br /> <br />THE NIGHT ALARM</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“I’m not thrilled by what you say, Perk, because
I’ve been more than half expecting to hear
that discovery. Glad you got on to him okay;
because it’s always best to know what’s in the
wind. What sort of a chap is he like?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack spoke in his usual calm way, and the other
realized he had undoubtedly been prepared for
the sudden news.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ out o’ the way ’bout his looks, far as
I c’n see,” was Perk’s reply; “on’y got a few
squints at the guy; but he’s keepin’ tab o’ our
movements I guess now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Reckon he might be one of those lads in the
Ryan ship that crashed in flames after they’d
flown the coop?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! just can’t be dead sure, partner,”
chuckled Perk; “but there’s somethin’ ’bout his
walk that gets me into believin’ he’s the <i>kiwi</i>
that pilot was keepin’ on our tail so long, stickin’
like a leech from a mud-hole.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder,” the other went on to say, as if
talking to himself; “if that’s the case then, both
those duffers pulled through with their lives, and
not so badly hurt. Honestly I’m a bit glad that’s
so, for up to the present I’ve never had occasion
to take a human life.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk snorted on hearing this.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if so be you’d been ten years older, my
boy, mebbe you’d not be able to say that—chances
are you’d a been mixed up in that mess across the
Atlantic, when Yanks an’ Johnny Rebs were
fightin’ shoulder to shoulder, and it was a case o’
a Heine pilot’s life or our’n. But if you keep
on with Uncle Sam’s service as you’re adoin’
right now, the time’ll come for you to fetch back
a dead man who jest <i>wouldn’t</i> let hisself be captured.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like as not,” remarked Jack; “but there’s no
need of crossing a river till you come to it; so
I’m not taking trouble by the forelock away
ahead of time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’ll we do ’bout this dickey bird that’s
bobbin’ at our heels so gaily, tell me, partner?”
pursued Perk, eagerly, as though in his fighting
heart he was actually hoping his superior would
give the order to turn on their persistent pursuer,
and at least blacken both his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! nothing at all, Perk; let him run his
rope; only we’ll keep along streets where there’s
plenty of company, and be prepared for any sort
of ambush; though I can’t believe he’d be crazy
enough to start anything so early in the evening—if
the hour was close to midnight, things
might be different. There are any number of
tough cases in this old Creole city ready to handle
a sticking game for the coin in it—blacks and
yellows and whites it doesn’t matter which—all
of them are assassins at heart.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then you don’t care if he shadows us straight
to the hotel?” demanded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Much good that will do him.” said Jack with
a light laugh; “the chances are two to one he
already knows where we’ve put up, and has had
some spy dog me to the Federal building. When
the time comes for us to jump off we’ll find a
slick way to hop our ship without giving these
boys a show-down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently they arrived at the hotel entrance,
without any untoward incident arising to mar
the quiet of the evening. Perk cast a parting
glance toward their rear just before entering,
and seeing the shadowy figure hovering not far
away, considered it a part of his duty to place
his thumb to his nose, and wiggle his fingers
derisively, at the same time uttering a snarl like
a bobcat at bay, to express his utter contempt.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once in their room, Jack first of all cast about
as if to decide whether any uninvited guest had
intruded on their preserves while they were absent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything seems to be just as we left it,”
he told his running mate, after making this little
survey, “and even if some busybody did get in
here with the aid of a pass-key borrowed from a
chambermaid, he was shrewd enough not to mess
things up like they did with our friend Scotty
of the air mail bunch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess now they must acome to the conclusion
you keep the letter o’ instructions ’bout your
person,” suggested Perk, wisely, “which, bein’
the case mebbe now they figger on sneakin’ in
here while we’re sound asleep, an’ agoin’ through
your clothes in regulation style. They do tell me
there be sneak thieves right clever in this same
burgh, equal to the ones out in India, where they
c’n steal the sheet from under a sleeper, without
wakin’ him up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I understand that’s really true, partner,” Jack
agreed; “but we’re not going to let them have
half a chance, even if they hired all the crooks
in New Orleans to play the game.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sounds good to me, boss,” Perk declared.
“We’ll manage to sleep with one eye open, an’
if any critter tries to give us the once over, he’ll
wish he’d never been born, that’s all I know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Before turning in, Jack placed a chair so nicely
balanced that in case of the door being ever so
slightly opened it would crash to the floor, making
enough noise to arouse the Seven Sleepers.
Perk grinned at seeing him prepare this “guardian
angel” as he termed it, and lost no time himself
in “hitting the hay.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Some time later in the night, when outside
noises had almost died away, there came a loud
clatter that awoke both the sleepers instantly.
They bounced out on the floor in their pajamas,
with Jack pulling the cord he had attached to
the electric bulb, so that the room was magically
illuminated.</p>

<p class='c013'>The chair lay on its side, and just beyond Perk
could see that their door was partly open; the
key had been left in the lock, but skillful fingers
must have manipulated it by means of
slender-jawed pliers, showing the touch of a professional
thief.</p>

<p class='c013'>Straight toward the door the form of Perk was
projected—a hungry lion could hardly have
made a more pronounced leap at some four-legged
game which he had been stalking.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tearing open the door still wider, Perk thrust
out his head, and looked up and down the hotel
corridor. He fancied he could make out a dim
figure far along the poorly lighted hall, but it
vanished like a phantom even as he stared, evidently
turning some corner.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there were other sounds arising—doors
all along the corridor were opening, and heads
being projected, showing how the startling alarm
had awakened numerous other sleepers, who
may have imagined an earthquake was in process
of occurring, though such a happening was utterly
foreign to the metropolis on the Lower Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c013'>Voices, too, were heard, from both masculine
as well as feminine sources, as the aroused hotel
guests endeavored to fathom the real meaning
of the row.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, seeing there was nothing doing, closed
the door, and locked it again; after which he
turned to his companion who had been watching
his actions with more or less amusement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Consarn his picture,” growled the old fighter;
“he got off scot free; I jest glimpsed him
aturnin’ the first bend down the hall. Blamed
shame I couldn’t come to grips with the yeller
cub—I’d a given a heap to twist his neck
some, you bet I would. Mebbe now I’d otter sit
up the rest o’ the night to make certain, eh,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not the slightest need of such a thing, partner,”
Jack assured him. “I’ll fix that door so it
won’t be opened again in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c013'>With that he again took the stout chair, and
placed it diagonally against the door, so that its
top rested just under the knob; after that had
been accomplished it must needs be a battering-ram
that could burst in on them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not content with that, Jack went to each of
the two windows, thrust out his head to examine
for the second time the face of the outer wall of
the building so as to make sure there was no
ledge wide enough to give a would-be trespasser
foothold.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not the ghost of a chance for the most nimble
thief to get in by way of a window, Perk, so
back to bed we go, and sleep like babes in the
wood for we’re in the third story and far enough
from a fire escape to be secure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk grinned and nodded acquiescence; truth
to tell he was not at all averse to starting all over
again—possibly the rude interruption had disturbed
him just when he was starting to partake
of a royal feast that covered every one of his most
beloved dishes and he was hugging the delusion
to his heart that if given another chance history
might repeat itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>At least there was no further alarm, and the
night passed into oblivion like all its countless
predecessors with the rising sun arousing the
two comrades, and Perk as usual singing out
that he felt as though he could easily manage two
customary breakfasts in that delighful restaurant
where they were already feeling so much at
home.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c014'>CHAPTER XII <br /> <br />PLAYING WITH FIRE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>During the morning Jack took a taxi and paid
another visit to the offices in the government
building where Mr. Adkins had his desk, doing
his daily stunt under the direction of the U. S.
District Attorney and other officials in the service
of Uncle Sam.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, also, had his job laid out for him, which
was to circulate around until he felt positive he
had thrown off any possible spy after which it
was his duty to make certain purchases, following
the list Jack had given him, have them all
sent to the aviation field in charge of the man
Mr. Adkins had placed on guard at the hangar
containing their ship and thus completing the
stock of supplies necessary for their long flight
and survey work.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk carried out his instructions to the letter,
and with great vim, since the fact of their laying
in these stores was a positive indication that
things were coming to pass insuring a speedy
getaway and <i>Action</i> was what had come to be
the greatest asset in life to Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>They met again at noon in their eating place,
where, choosing an isolated corner table they
could discuss their plan of campaign, even while
attending to the wants of the inner man.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk made his report, which the other seemed
to find good, judging from his frequent nods of
acquiescence and when the story had been told
to the last word, Perk felt it was his turn to
learn things.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess now you got the last batch o’ information
from His Nibs, Jack?” he hastened to
ask, expectantly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sure did, partner,” he was told. “A few
scraps of fresh news that’d be likely to interest
us had drifted in since I saw Mr. Adkins last,
which he passed along to me. I’ll sort these
shreds over later, and fix them where they belong.
So far as I can see now they corroborate
what we’ve already been so strongly believing
must be a fact.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which means, I guess, boss, we head west?”
ventured Perk, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Into the setting sun—that’s right, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do we still expect to keep in touch with Mr.
Adkins, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whenever the chance opens up, and we have
any important news to send along or want to
know certain things, perhaps even to call on him
for that bunch of old-time Texas Rangers he
said he could turn over to us if we found any
use for them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be!” said Perk, plainly excited, “I
sure do hope that emergency does bob up, ’cause
I’d give my last Mex dollar to glimpse them
rearin’, tearin’ ole fighters knockin’ spots outen
the bunch o ’lawless ringers Slippery Slim’s
gathered around him. Chances are they’d skip
out like hot fleas soon as they heard the ol’time
battle cry o’ the defenders o’ the Rio Grande in
the days when cattle rustlers raided the ranches
down Texas way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But we’ve got to remember,” cautioned
Jack, “that these chaps are like lean hungry
wolves, that never leave the trail of a wounded
stag as long as they can crawl along. I’m not
fancying we’ve pulled the wool over their eyes
so far and that fact was brought to my attention
just after I got back from conferring with
Mr. Adkins.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As how, boss?” queried the curious Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t just know what influenced me after
I’d entered the hotel, to step back and look out
again,” explained Jack. “There was the driver
of my taxi, the trusty who’d been recommended
by the clerk at the desk, talking earnestly with
an unknown party and even as I watched I saw
him thrust a bank note into the chauffeur’s itching
hand, showing that he has been corrupted
and is in cohoot with our enemies.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! is it so rotten bad as all that, partner?”
bleated the disgusted Perk, “All I c’n
say is I sure do hope it was a nice brand new five-dollar
bill he handed over to the yeller dog, an’
that it’s agoin’ to turn out to be a sample o’ their
bogus money outfit. Serve the slick renegade if
he got hisself pulled in for passin’ a counterfeit
note on some guy that ain’t goin’ to sit by and
take what’s comin’ to him without raisin’ a nice
howl.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t be too vindictive, Perk,” Jack told
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, partner, ever see the boob afore?” the
other demanded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you mean the chap who was pumping my
driver for all that was out, Perk, I can’t say
that I have. He was a flashily dressed man,
with loud clothes that would stamp him as a
gambler, like those who used to travel on these
Mississippi River steamboats in the old days before
the Civil War, fleecing unsuspecting passengers
out of all their money and I haven’t
the least doubt but what he’s a member of the
very gang we’re expecting to round up. Mr.
Adkins told me it was simply amazing the vastness
of the combine Slippery Slim’s managed to
gather around him but he was certain it must
number many scores of workers, all obeying the
orders of the mainspring—crooked Slim Garrabrant.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! the more you keep on tellin’ me them
big stories, Jack, the happier it all makes me
’cause I seem to just know there’s bound to be a
heap o’ rough house stuff croppin’ up, to cool
my blood, ragin’ hot just now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some fine day you’ll be rubbing up against
enough fighting to make you call quits with the
game. Perk, my boy; and it’s just likely to crop
up before long if indications count for anything.
I felt pretty sure from his swagger that
this fellow might be the very same master mind
in charge of that Ryan boat—then, too, when he
walked away he had a little limp, which might
have come from striking the ground so hard
after his chute let him down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Darned pity he didn’t break a leg, or even
his measly ol’ neck, I’d say,” grumbled Perk, one
of his fits of resentment gripping him just then.
“Got no use for these treacherous snakes that
squirm, and worm their way into the confidence
o’ honest gents, on’y to play a low-down trick,
an’ fill their pockets with smackers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s one thing we’ve got to guard
against,” suggested Jack, who seemed to have a
faculty for looking at every side of a picture,
and anticipating troubles that might never have
occurred to others less gifted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As what, partner?” asked Perk, brightening
up once more.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Delay is what they may be hoping for—some
way to hold us here while important news is
carried to headquarters. I can even see how
they might make some sort of ridiculous charge
against us to the police, in hopes we would be
held several days under suspicion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk looked astonished.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But see here, boss, we got our credentials
from Washington to prove we’re in the Secret
Service, an’ sky detectives at that; they jest
wouldn’t dare hold us on some sorter flimsy
charge ’cause that’d get ’em in hard with the
Government, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never know how these affairs may turn
out,” said Jack. “Often there seems to be some
kind of a jealous feeling between States officers
and those of the Government—almost like a little
vendetta, each arm of the Law striking out
at the other, and getting in a sly lick that’s good
for a laugh after hostilities have died down.
These Southern city police might make out
there was a grave charge of abduction or something
like that, compelling them to hold us <i>incommunicado</i>—that
is keep us from intercourse
with the U. S. District Attorney’s office until
several days had elapsed and then setting us
free with a lot of apologies that didn’t mean anything
whatsoever.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! I get your drift partner,” said Perk,
frowning. “We sure can’t afford to spend any
of our valuable time in the hoosgow here, if we
c’n help it. ’Cause things set that way I hope
you get busy an’ fix it so we’ll shake the dust o’
this same burgh off our shoes in a hurry. Got
the date settled yet, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shook hands with, and said goodbye to Mr.
Adkins this morning, Perk and you are at
liberty to figure that out as you please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it’s <i>tonight</i>?” asked the other, looking
well satisfied with such an enticing programme.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wind and weather permitting we’ll clear out
soon after twilight settles down on the city and
the river,” Jack assured his understudy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me, I’m sittin’ pretty, an’ taking things as
they come along, old hoss,” continued Perk.
“Let’s perambulate and attend to the crying
needs of this high noon hour—the girl told me
they expected to have apple dumplings for lunch
today an’ that’s one I’d nominate as bein’ among
my prime favorites—you know I got a <i>few</i> I
really enjoy an’ that’s no lie either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I know a good many on your list—fact
is,” said frank Jack, “if I ran down the whole
menu this noon there’d be only a scant few that’s
missed being called your especial favorites each
in its turn as the wind blew. But just as well
we did all the eating while the chance lasts, for
only a magician can tell what our bill of fare is
going to be during the coming week or two—some
weird dishes most likely—boiled owl,
fried rattlesnake, baked prairie dog—Heaven
knows to what ends we may be reduced.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have a heart, partner, don’t take my healthy
appetite away by mentionin’ them terrible
dishes. ’Member you promised we’d hire a taxi
after lunch, an’ drive all around the city, lampin’
the big sights like the French market, the queer
buryin’ places where holes in thick walls take
the place o’ graves, on ’count o’ there bein’ so
much water in the ground, with the city settin’
so low down, an’ the ol’ Mississippi on one o’
its benders. Then I want to eat Gulf oysters
an’ shrimp at one o’ them cute little stands we
noticed yesterday afternoon; try a reg’lar Creole
dinner tonight at that place Mr. Adkins told us
about—after which I’m all done with Orleans,
an’ ready to pull up stakes for keeps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll keep that to the last, Perk, and go to
the flying field from the eating house by taxi.
From that time on we’ll have to depend on our
own heads and hands to keep us out of difficulties.
But let’s hope we can climb up to a three
thousand foot ceiling, and strike out as if we
were aiming for Savannah or Jacksonville, only
to swing around inside of half an hour, climb
high over the city and river and put for the
Texas border at full speed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This enchanting program gave Perk much
cause for rejoicing and he sat down at their regular
table in the restaurant feeling, as he expressed
it, “happy as a clam at high tide” and
full of little laughs that seemed to gurgle up
from his shoes.</p>

<p class='c013'>They chatted of other happenings, not wishing
to “talk shop” in such a crowded place, lest
listening ears pick up certain information that
could be used greatly to their disadvantage—Perk
had an endless fund of interesting reminiscences
that, told in his inimitable fashion,
were a never failing source of joy to the appreciative
air pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was spent in motoring all
around the most interesting portions of the city,
the obliging Mr. Adkins having made out a list
of subjects they should not miss seeing while on
this first visit to the justly famous Louisiana metropolis.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIII <br /> <br />THE HOP-OFF</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Leaving the hotel, after settling their account,
and still making use of the taxi with its accommodating
driver, Jack and his comrade had
taken what small amount of hand luggage they
possessed along with them, not meaning to come
back again.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins had recommended a small but
unique restaurant run by a buxom French madame,
where they could have a Creole supper,
such as would long haunt their memories as a
genuine treat and it was to this place they ordered
their driver to convey them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both of them felt fairly convinced they had
been shadowed during the afternoon, although
so carefully must this have been accomplished
they had no positive proof to make it what Perk
would term a “dead certainty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They really did have a delightful “feed,” and
the dishes set before them were as a rule complete
mysteries although the obliging madame,
seeing they were tasting her triumphs of the
French <i>chef’s</i> art for the first time, gladly explained
the nature of the food they consumed
with so much gusto.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was fascinated with his supper, and inwardly
vowed that this should not be the last time
he would partake of tasty Creole dishes. This
duty fulfilled, they faced the next progressive
step in their night’s program—making for
the aviation field, and boarding their ship for
a speedy takeoff, their ultimate goal neither of
them could say just where, save that if all went
well they expected to be somewhere along the
California border within the next few days.</p>

<p class='c013'>The taxi was waiting, with the chauffeur on
the alert. He had already been advised of the
fact that they anticipated having some parties
attempt to spy upon them as evening settled
down and on this account he had maintained a
strict watch for troublesome visitors who might
even attempt to threaten him with bodily injury
unless he agreed to enter into their plans for
delaying the flight of the two flyers, as he knew
his passengers to be from what he had been told.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I see our taxi’s still on deck, partner,”
observed Perk, just as if he might have suspected
they would find it missing, with a detail of grim
city police waiting to escort them to the lockup,
they to be held in durance vile until serious
charges against them could be sifted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing came along to bother you, Henri?”
asked Jack of the smiling driver, who laughed
as he said in reply:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I haf seen one beeg hulk of ze man hanging
around, M’sieu, and looking as if he would like
to eat me up but me, I haf been an old soldier
in the Grand Army of France, and I think he did
not like the way I throw my chest out thees way,
and walk as eef I am on guard duty; he did not
address a single word to me, but just a little
while ago he disappear—I think he may haf
gone to get more courage out of ze glass.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good boy, Henri,” said the grinning Perk,
clapping a hand on the stalwart chauffeur’s
shoulder; “for myself I should not like to tackle
you when you have your fighting face all set.
Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So they were off, and heading out in the direction
of the aviation grounds, with the first shadows
of approaching evening gathering around
them. Perk may have been more or less nervous,
in anticipation of something coming to pass that
would seriously cripple their plans for a speedy
flight, since he kept turning his head from side
to side and scrutinizing every one they saw upon
the streets they traversed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Henri maintained a fairly good speed, all the
law would permit, so that few cars passed them
on the road. Perk managed to watch closely,
and never a motor came booming along in their
wake, honking to announce the driver’s intention
to pass by, than he had his eyes glued on the car
and continued to pay strict attention until it
had crept well up ahead.</p>

<p class='c013'>But after all nothing out of the way came to
pass, and eventually they reached the aviation
field where they found lights already in play,
since a delayed air mail ship was hovering over
signaling for better illumination. There was
some small damage in regard to the steering
gear, making it a bit risky to try a landing unless
the field was brilliantly lighted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You made an arrangement with a couple of
the ground force to hang around so as to help
us get the crate out okay, didn’t you, Perk?”
queried Jack, as they drew up close to the particular
hangar where they had seen their plane
placed in quarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, I sure did, Jack,” the other replied.
“Must be they’re over where that crate hanging
overhead means to land—somethin’ wrong mebbe
but they gimme their word to stay around
till we got here—there, I c’n lamp the guys
runnin’ thisaways right now, so it’s okay, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I see them coming,” returned the other,
himself a bit relieved, since the intended departure
was a most important episode in their plans,
and to meet with any sort of a setback would
be most aggravating indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The two mechanicians quickly arrived, the
hanger was unlocked and opened so as to permit
the exit of the ship. First of all both flyers
hastened to don their working togs, then fasten
on the ’chutes with the harness necessary for the
purpose, all working smoothly and finally clapping
their helmets on their heads, with the earflaps
secured to keep things in readiness for any
emergency that might crop up.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being accomplished, Jack gave the word
to have the heavy ship dragged out into the open.
He knew that his assistant would have looked
after everything essential to their comfort during
the coming flight for Perk was one of those
dependable fellows who carry out orders with
machine-like regularity.</p>

<p class='c013'>A few parties had hastened up to see what
was going on but so far as Perk could tell they
were either workers connected with the field, or
else visitors from the city, who had lingered to
watch the landing of the air mail, so as to tell
how it was done when they reached their several
homes, to partake of a late supper.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now the ship had been swung around so as
to head into the west, since the soft evening breeze
was coming from that quarter and everything
seemed in readiness for the take-off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, still surveying his surroundings as if
still cherishing a fragment of his former suspicions
that all might not be as lovely as surface
indications would announce, started to climb
aboard. Jack on his part was handing some
money to the two men, not wishing to leave a
single thing unpaid when passing out from New
Orleans—there was nothing to be done about
their use of the hangar, since Mr. Adkins had
assured him that matter had already been taken
care of, regardless of how long they chose to
linger in the Crescent City.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, too, cast a last glance around, just as he
would have done had he still been with the air
mail service and about to start off on his customary
night flight with the north-bound sacks
of letters and the express matter that vent along.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then he heard Perk give vent to a hurried
exclamation:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get aboard, partner; I guess the measly critters
are acomin’ down on us like hot cakes right
now. Lookit how they start arunnin’ thisaway,
will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did not bother looking, as every second
might be valuable; he climbed aboard with alacrity,
and settled down in his seat; at the same time
calling out to the helpers to stand aside. Then
he pulled the gun, with the motor responding
instantly, so well had Perk done his work when
checking up the ship that morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was still glueing his eyes on the several
figures now racing madly in their general direction,
and waving their arms wildly; no doubt
they had started to shout in addition, but the
descending air mail crate was making more or
less racket, which, added to by their own motor’s
thunder, prevented any one from hearing what
they may have been whooping.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was trembling with an excess of emotion—evidently
they had just escaped “by the
skin of their teeth,” for he felt certain he could
distinguish the uniforms of the police in the
little bunch of runners.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Played your hand just a mite too late, gents!”
Perk was whooping as he in turn waved a mocking
adieu backward; “thought you’d ketch a
weasel asleep, I guess, but not so easy, you gate
crashers. Wow! here we go spinnin’ along like
the wind, and it’s goodnight to the bunch. Huh!
shootin’ at us, air you—jest awastin’ ammunition,
that’s all, boys. Go ’way back an’ sit down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Jack lifted her in an upward fling, and
they were off like a startled hawk!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIV <br /> <br />SKIRTING THE GULF</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There was some shooting going on back there,
for although of course the watchful Perk failed
to catch the sound of discharges of guns, he did
see flash after flash, proclaiming that the police,
under the impression that important criminals
were beating them to it, wished to show
their warlike spirit by such a bombardment.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the flying missiles came anywhere near the
ascending plane that fact was not manifest to the
two occupants of the cockpit; their movements
must have been too speedy for such an attack to
be successful and almost immediately they had
risen beyond the danger line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was feeling vastly relieved, for it would
have been a bad beginning of their special mission
were they detained for days in the Southern
city, while the agents of the great counterfeit
league held the upper hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>He could see with the last glimpse he had of
the aviation field that all this lively accompaniment
to their take-off had created considerable
excitement—people were running back and
forth, like milling cattle when stampeded in a
furious thunder storm and Perk even fancied
there was some sort of a movement as though a
ship would be sent after them in pursuit.</p>

<p class='c013'>That troubled him not a bit, because already
they were leaving the field far in their wake, and
would really be lost in the gathering shadows of
coming night before any pursuit plane left the
ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides, had they not already had one experience
along those lines, and completely worsted
the persistent enemy, sending their boat down in
spirals of flames, with the two occupants forced
to “bail out” in order to save their lives?</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk put that possibility completely out of
his mind and busied himself with more practical
affairs. First of all he was desirous of communicating
with his comrade and to do this
they must have those indispensible head-phones
clapped to their ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was already applying his own pair with a
confidence inspired by frequent applications,
after which he managed to get Jack equipped
with the other pair.</p>

<p class='c013'>Steadily they continued to ascend, and swing
around until they faced the east, following the
plan Jack had outlined to his mate. Not too
high did the pilot urge his craft, since such a
course was apt to bring them in the sunlight
that still lingered along the upper air lanes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, they turned out to be a hot bunch all
right, partner,” was what Perk observed, when
he had the harness adjusted and the ear-phone
means of communication in shape for use.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You reckon they must have fetched the police
out with them, do you, Perk?” demanded the
one at the stick, as he kept an eye on his dials
spread across the black dashboard in front of the
cockpit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! just what they did, old hoss,” returned
the other, vehemently, but accompanying his remark
with a loud chuckle that told of secret
amusement, he being excessively fond of anything
that smacked of a joke; “an’ they kept up
a runnin’ fire at us, let me tell you—could see the
flashes spittin’ like fire crackers on the Fourth
o’ July.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All of which sounds like they must have told
a pretty wild and woolly yarn to the cops, to
make them want us as bad as that, eh, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Makes me think they got an idea this ain’t
goin’ to be just a ordinary man-hunt, but something
worth while; we should worry, Jack.
Mebbe they a’ready see the handwritin’ on the
wall, an’ mean to try an’ upset us in the start,
’fore we get agoin’ full tilt. Notice you’ve gone
an’ headed east, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It may fool them; but whether it does or not,
Perk, such a move’s our proper caper. When
we’ve gone something like ten or fifteen miles
we’ll get on the curve, swing around to the south,
and then when in sight of the gulf turn due west;
after that we’ll be on our way to the place where
our work is waiting for us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! had an idea you’d just climb till out
o’ sight, an’ then cross over the city and river—how
’bout it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too much risk to begin with,” came the ready
reply, showing how Jack always planned ahead;
“you know how a rushing boat can be heard
clearly even when lost to sight among the clouds.
It might be those same smart chaps, backed by
the authority of the police, would commandeer
a ship, and cruise around over the city, so as to
learn if we <i>did</i> come back so as to line out into
the heart of Texas; to make sure such a giveaway
of our plans can’t upset our calculations
we’ll cross the delta of the Mississippi close to
where it joins its muddy waters with the gulf.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you now, partner, an’ let me say I guess
that’s the safest game we c’n play. Time don’t
count anything wuth while with us on this trip
but results are what we crave.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it that time, boy, the Big Boss has
confidence in our being able to fetch home the
bacon, and we’re bound to prove he didn’t make
any mistake in putting us on the job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>All this time they continued to zoom along
like a frightened wild duck, and it was not long
before Jack was turning the nose of his ship
toward the south. The night had not as yet
settled down over the earth, although they were
holding an altitude of several thousand feet and
by straining his eyes a bit Perk was able to distinguish
objects far below—he could tell when
they passed over a large sheet of water, probably
Lake Ponchartrain, with narrower cuts winding
through vast marshes, and seas of waving reeds;
also begin to catch fugitive glimpses of the still
distant Mexican Gulf stretching away to the
mysterious south.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was all deeply interesting to Perk, always
on the lookout for fresh and novel scenes; for as
it happened, thus far in all his wanderings he
had really never looked upon that historical sheet
of salt water; although reading many a rattling
romance of the days when buccaneers and pirates
haunted the sub-tropical waters of that same
gulf, lying in wait for the Spanish galleons laden
with gold bars taken from the prodigally rich
mines of Mexico and Central America.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Perk’s mind those historical personages,
like Blackbeard, and his fellow rovers of the
Black Flag, lent a glamour to the great body of
water that was apt to thrill him through and
through whenever he allowed his gaze to fall
upon its restless surface, and dark secrets of the
past ages.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards their course was again
altered, with the ship swinging into the west. It
would seem to have been something like extreme
caution on Jack’s part but from all accounts, as
well as from their own experience with the desperate
gang that had given Uncle Sam so much
trouble, the scoundrels had a tremendous game
at stage, and were ready to go to any lengths to
protect the profitable conspiracy from being
smashed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Safety before speed” had always been Jack’s
slogan, which could be accounted one of the leading
reasons for the success that had come to him
in the various vocations he had followed—as a
county fair barn-stormer, then in the regular air
mail service, and now finally with the celebrated
Secret Service arm of the Government, entrusted
with one of the most abnormal duties ever given
out to its members.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not too dark for Perk to know when they
were passing over the several outlets to the
mighty river; indeed, he was even able to distinguish
an ocean going steamship heading up
toward the city of New Orleans; for its lights
were plainly in evidence and those who chanced
to be on deck could probably catch the throb of
their motor, since the air was unusually still,
allowing sounds to be heard at great distances,
especially when in the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then finally they left the water behind, and
found themselves passing over great stretches of
sugarcane, and bamboo thickets, with cabins of
the humble blacks in little hamlets, sometimes
villages of the lowlands, where, as Perk plainly
recollected, recent terrible floods had wrought
such damage.</p>

<p class='c013'>So the night wore on, and thus far nothing
had occurred to cause them the slightest worry.
If their cunning enemies suspected them of
planning to go west, and baiting the chief in his
lair, there was nothing as yet to show that they
were making arrangements to intercept the air
adventurers on their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>An hour—two of them passed, and still they
kept making rapid progress. The moon was long
above the eastern horizon, although occasionally
obscured by passing clouds but Perk told himself
it was a pretty fair night, all things considered,
and that he had “no kick coming.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c014'>CHAPTER XV <br /> <br />PERK AS A FIRE-FIGHTER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was not far from midnight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had insisted on taking over the controls,
so that Jack might secure a little rest, possibly
even pick up a few catnaps in addition. They
were at a low altitude, perhaps not more than a
thousand feet up, since the air was a bit cool
higher and it was certain they stood in no
danger from colliding with mountain peaks
while crossing the wide State of Texas, where
nothing save the level plains lay beneath.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was alive to his duties, but this did not
keep him from occasionally stretching his neck,
so as to look over the coaming of the cockpit,
and trying to make out objects that might be
dimly detected on the seemingly limitless plain
below.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a rule next to nothing worth while rewarded
these efforts and really he continued
doing his little stunt from sheer habit, but there
did come a time when he showed sudden interest,
and even half arose from his seat to stare
with increasing intensity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not only that but he immediately banked, to
start circling around a certain point. A minute
afterwards Perk reached out and shook Jack
gently by the shoulder. The ear-phones being
still affixed to their heads, Jack naturally desired
to know what was up, and did his pal wish to
give over the stick to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ doing, partner,” he was told with
emphasis; “but there’s somethin’ queer goin’ on
down yonder, and I’ve swung around so’s to give
it the once over. On your right, Jack, an’ there,
see how it sparks up again, will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say it looks like a fire,” ventured Jack,
after taking a good look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My idea to a fraction, boss!” snapped the
deeply interested Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like it might be breaking out through
the roof of some sort of cabin, or ranch house,”
further suggested Jack, himself now almost as
excited as his running mate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, boy!” declared Perk; “but somehow
I don’t lamp anybody kickin’ around in a
big fuss, ’cause o’ the shack bein’ ablaze; strikes
me either nobody ain’t to home or else they’re
so sound asleep they don’t know what’s goin’ on.
Glory be! if that’s the case, partner, they stand
a mighty good chance o’ bein’ burnt to death in
their beds. What ought we do ’bout it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“First place we’ve just got to rouse ’em up,
and the way to do that is to rush our engine to the
limit, so’s to make a big row—if that doesn’t
wake anybody it’ll only mean they’re away from
home—or else already smothered by the smoke.”
Perk accordingly started up such a racket that
the dreadful roaring noise seemed hoarse enough
to awaken the dead and all the while he kept
swinging around in a continuous circle.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, bending over the side, watched to see if
this had any effect, nor was his discovery long
delayed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That fetched them, Perk—I can see several
moving figures, and they seem to be rushing about
with pails in their hands. If the fire hasn’t got
too strong a start they may be able to throw
enough water to put it out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, couldn’t we do somethin’ more to help
the poor dicks?” cried Perk, ever ready and
willing to assist anybody in trouble, no matter
at what cost or personal risk to himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It mightn’t be a safe thing to attempt a blind
landing,” he was told; but something in Jack’s
voice or manner when he said this encouraged
Perk to go a bit further.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, chances are it’s as level as a barn floor
down there,” he hastened to say, eagerly; “here,
you could take the stick—there never was a better
hand at makin’ a three-point landin’ than
you, partner; me, I might drop a few flares down,
an’ that’d give us a squint o’ the ground. If we
kept to leeward o’ the fire there wouldn’t be any
risk from sparks, don’t you see, Jack? I never
yet had such a fat chance to be a fire-fighter;
let’s go, boy—they need all the help they c’n
get, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The temptation was so great it soon overpowered
Jack’s sense of caution; really he fancied
he would never forgive himself if he allowed
Perk to show a higher sense of duty to people
in distress than he himself could display.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, you win, Perk!” he quickly called
out; “hand over the stick, and get those flares
ready to drop when I give the word.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk started to make a move, showing that he
knew just where the objects of his desire were
located, for he did not have to leave his seat in
order to place his hand upon the small package
of flares.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile Jack had reduced their speed to
a minimum compatible with safety, still continuing
that circular movement. The fire had
by this time assumed sufficient proportions to
dispel any doubts they may have entertained regarding
its true nature, for it was burning at a
lively rate. Jack could see a crouching figure
sprawled on the roof, and apparently emptying
bucket after bucket of water on the greedy flames,
and passing the empties back down the nearby
ladder to some one standing on an upper rung.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was all mighty exciting, and to Jack seemed
like some sort of fetching picture as shown on
the silver screen at the movies—a scene developed
through the skill of a wizard director, aided
by a group of star actors, so as to bring out all
the realistic effects.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get ready, Perk!” he told the other suddenly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All set, partner,” came the inspiring response.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let her go, then!” called out the pilot, just
as he found himself over a point to leeward of the
burning ranch house that he figured would be
the best place to make a landing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had a flare falling almost as the last
words left the lips of the pilot and then both
of them used their eyes to advantage as it neared
the ground, lighting up a small section fairly
well—at least what he thus saw seemed to convince
Jack it would be fairly safe to attempt a
landing, for the ground looked smooth, and free
from outbuildings, corrals, or wire fences.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Drop another, quick as you can!” directed
Jack; then, as this was carried out he started
down, showing the die was cast, come what
would.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk threw a third flare to one side, in the
hope that its light would afford his pilot a chance
to effect one of his really marvelous landings;
which turned out to be sound reasoning on his
part—the shock when their landing gear came in
contact with the ground was not very severe, and
Jack managed so that they did not run more than
thirty feet toward the burning house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus far all was well.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was out of the cockpit like a flash, but
managed to hold his eager spirit in check long
enough to allow his comrade to join him. Then
they hurried over to the building, which they
could now see, thanks to both the moonlight and
the brilliance of the blaze, must be some kind of
a ranch house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Several men who had the appearance of cow
punchers were working for all they were worth,
fetching water from a well, and hurling it where
it was calculated to do the most good.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s give you a hand in that game, neighbors!”
Jack burst out with, as he joined the string,
backed by Perk, and commenced handling
buckets full and buckets empty, with as much
vim as though tested and tried members of a
village fire company.</p>

<p class='c013'>At such a time the addition of two more
willing workers can do considerable toward
smothering a fire, especially when there happens
to be no wind moving; and from the moment of
their arrival things began to take on a better
look as though up to then the fight had been
hovering “on the fence,” as Perk called it, and
the balance being overturned, victory was in
sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was in his glory, and the brisk way in
which he hurried those buckets along was worth
going a long way to witness; Jack never would
forget how proud he felt over the marvelous performance
of his running mate, and how those
encouraging cries, so constantly emitted by Perk,
seemed to enthuse everybody with fresh vim and
go.</p>

<p class='c013'>Finally the last spark was extinguished, and
the house saved, having suffered but scant damage.
Then the men, yes, and women too, gathered
around the pair of aviators who had come
on the scene just in the nick of time, to first of
all arouse the people of the prairie ranch to a
sense of the danger that hovered over their heads,
and finally take chances in effecting what might
have been a rough landing, so as to lend their
material aid to the fire fighters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Surely you will not think of starting off again
till break of day,” the big man with the white
head of hair, evidently the rancher himself, was
saying, while engaged in pumping the hands of
the two who had dropped down from the sky,
as it were, to bring warning of the burning roof,
and start the stiff fight against the greedy flames
that had ended so successfully. “Stay and eat
breakfast with us, strangers; we’d like to know
you both some better, and have a chance to thank
you most heartily.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unfortunately we must be on our way, neighbor,”
Jack told him. “It happens we are on
special duty, and delay might upset certain plans
we are bent on following out. It was just by
sheer accident we discovered the fire, and took
the customary means for attracting attention that
all air pilots employ; but some other day, if we
chance to be in this neighborhood, we’d be
pleased to see more of you all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The women added their voices to the pressing
invitation, but Jack was forced to decline, although
doing so smilingly, since he would have
liked very much to see more of these warm-hearted
stockmen and their wild riders, possibly
picking up some useful knowledge concerning
the way a ranch is run in these modern days, so
different from early times in the cattle country.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is absolutely necessary for us to be going,”
Jack told them all, “if we are lucky enough to
be able to hop-off again. Perk, I wish you’d
take a look over toward the west, and see if the
ground is fairly clear; while I talk for a few
more minutes with our new friends here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was astute enough to avoid giving their
names to any one but the ranchman, who readily
promised not to mention them to a living soul;
he felt heavily indebted to Jack and his chum,
and considered that they knew their business
best—for one thing he felt absolutely certain the
fact of their being in such a hurry had nothing
whatever to do with any unlawful act on their
part—he had as much confidence in them as
though Jack had actually confided the fact of
their being Government Secret Service agents,
bound on a mission fraught with much peril to
life and limb, the prime object of which was to
save honest people from being victimized by a
gang of unprincipled sharks, makers of clever
bank notes that were without the pale of the
law and only base counterfeits, although clever
imitations of the genuine bills.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVI <br /> <br />IN THE GRIP OF THE STORM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Perk soon afterwards showed up, and seemed
so cheerful that it was evident his little scouting
mission had yielded favorable results.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems okay to me, partner!” he burst out
with, as soon as she came along; “course it ain’t
just as smooth as some fields we know but there
ain’t goin’ to be any smart trouble takin’ off, I
guess now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And are we holding the nose of the ship
straight in line of the course you took a squint
at, Perk?” Jack asked, as he prepared to climb
into his seat, the people of the ranch clustering
around, to gaze with wide open eyes at the fleet
aircraft, some of them doubtless seeing such a
modern cloud clipper for the first time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dead ahead, boss, an’ you’ll strike the right
racket, I’m tellin’ you,” came the positive assurance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then jump aboard, comrade, and we’ll put
it to the test,” saying which Jack himself climbed
into the waiting cockpit, to settle down in his
accustomed seat, take a quick glance at his dials
when the small light was turned on, and await
a signal from the other sky traveler that he was
“fixed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The way was clear, and the fact that just then
the gay old moon condescended to poke her smiling
face out from behind a mass of clouds assisted
more or less in giving the pilot some of the
necessary illumination—the rest must be left to
his native sagacity and instinct.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a bunch of cottonwoods at some
little distance ahead, the location of which Perk
had pointed out to his mate before settling down
in his seat but if all went well Jack calculated
to be able to clear them in good shape—did it
seem necessary he could swerve slightly to the
right, and have a clear field for the take-off.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a little shouting as the friendly
plane started to taxi along, but of course this was
smothered by the increasing roar of exhaust and
spinning propeller. Faster and faster they scurried
onward, and then started to rise on an angle
just sufficient to nicely clear the tops of the cottonwoods;
when Jack jazzed his motor, to find
it running as “sweet as a purring cat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So they departed only a short time after making
that landing which humanity had demanded
and in times to come the little episode was
likely to afford both aviators more or less satisfaction,
in that they had “seen their duty and
done it,” as Perk would say in his whimsical
way.</p>

<p class='c013'>As they continued on their way Perk found
himself wondering if this interesting adventure
was destined to be a sample of other equally
thrilling happenings in store for them the further
they dipped into the great game that had been
laid at their door by the powers that be at Washington.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whenever he came to thinking of the audacity
shown by Slippery Slim in virtually defying all
the authority of the Government, Perk would
feel his dander rising as if in great indignation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh!” he at one time told himself, being
rather fond of thus communing, as his thoughts
ran on, “we’ll call <i>his</i> bluff just the same, the
scaly ol’ gila monster, you wait an’ see. Thinks
he’s the whole works, the boss man-handler, does
he, just ’cause he’s outguessed a number o’ the
boys. This time he’s due to find himself up
against guys o’ the right size, who’ll jerk him
down off’n his high perch in a jiffy, or I miss
my ticket.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk kept on boasting in his customary
fashion, possibly to keep his mind on the subject.
Jack was paying little attention to side issues
just then for he knew his pal’s peculiarities, and
short-comings as well and having “exhausted
his boiler” Perk presently lapsed into utter
silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had climbed to a fairly high ceiling, and
caught only occasional fugitive glimpses of the
earth far below, when the moon chanced to break
through the banks of clouds, which intervals
became less and less frequent, Jack noticed.</p>

<p class='c013'>He did not altogether fancy the looks of the
heavens, by degrees becoming more and more
overcast; still, this might after all mean next to
nothing and their business was to keep steadily
on their way as if things were bound to come out
all right.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was now drawing well on toward midnight,
and they had placed hundreds of miles between
the city of their recent stay and themselves. Long
since Perk had taken what proved to be his last
glimpse of the vast gulf as seen far away toward
the south, when the night was brightly illuminated,
with the moon’s silvery rays shining on the
glistening waters, and making a picture that
even appealed to Perk’s rugged nature—after
that all he was able to make out was the monotonous
level plains that lay in every quarter,
as though the whole earth consisted of this same
stock country.</p>

<p class='c013'>No longer were they able to find any cheer in
the company of the moon, for the canopy above,
earlier in the night peopled by a multitude of
bright stars, was now gripped in dense masses
of clouds.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having thus lost his guide marks below, Jack
was compelled to place all dependence upon his
faithful instruments, but this of course was an
old story to one of his experience, so that he did
not do any worrying on that score.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, buried in his own thoughts, and paying
scant heed to what changes were taking place
in the signs of the weather, had no warning until
suddenly there came a dazzling flash, that was
almost instantly succeeded by a tremendous burst
of thunder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ginger pop! that means we’re booked for a
bit o’ storm, mebbe, eh, Jack?” was his startled
exclamation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s hope it turns out to be <i>only</i> a bluster,”
the pilot went on to say, as he turned the nose of
his ship upward, and commenced to climb, evidently
in hopes that by so doing they might get
above those low hanging clouds, and have clear
sailing while the disturbance lasted.</p>

<p class='c013'>When shortly afterwards a second electrical
crash almost stunned them by its violence, Perk
began to fumble for his oilskin coat, which he
was never without when aboard a boat with an
open cockpit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk could take a ducking with as much good
nature as the next fellow but just the same he
did not intend to get soaked if he could help it,
since a continuance of the flight, with a cold wind
likely to follow the rain, would not prove to be
the most delightful experience possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>No sooner had he accomplished the job of
securing his raincoat than he gave Jack the well
known signal that he meant to take over the
stick, and thus allow his comrade to also protect
himself against bad weather.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly both of them were presently thus
equipped, and ready to take whatever might be
in the offing. Meanwhile the ascent was continued
in spasms, for there was always a chance
of getting above such a storm, and avoiding the
worst of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The thunder claps became more frequent, and
also much louder, so that each sudden burst gave
them both a thrill, death seemed so close, for
should their speeding ship chance to attract one
of those dazzling bolts it would be all over for
the daring air adventurers, and no one be the
wiser concerning their taking-off, until possibly
after long months had passed, their bleached
bones might be discovered by some party of
plainsmen out looking for rustlers or seeking to
round up missing stock.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus far not a single drop of rain had fallen,
according to Perk’s calculations but the coming
of the drenching flood could not be much longer
delayed, he felt positive. Had there not been
so much racket around them those keen ears of
his might have detected a rushing sound in the
near distance, like the roar of the incoming tide
on the sandy shores of the gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then it came with a swoop, the wind whistling
around their ears and the rain beating a tattoo
against the fuselage of the ship, as well as striking
them smartly in the face, despite such protection
as their helmets and heavy goggles afforded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack certainly had his hands full in managing
the bobbing, shifting craft, gripped by those
shifty gusts that came with giant force, making
the flyers feel as though they were clinging to a
mere chip tossed about in the wild fury of a
Texas tempest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Time and again did Perk feel as though his
heart had jumped up in his throat, almost choking
him; seasoned veteran at this sort of thing
as he believed himself to be, he could not help
this feeling of helplessness in the hands of the
aroused elements; yet each time Jack managed
to bring their ship through the teeth of the storm
in a way that was next door to miraculous, and
if Perk had up to this time not fully appreciated
the astonishing skill and confidence of his younger
companion while at the controls in an emergency,
he certainly was getting his lesson then and
there, in a way to cause it to sink deep, and stick.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch17' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVII <br /> <br />A FIGHT WELL WON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was no longer possible for the busy pilot to
keep on his course. Every minute of his time
was taken up with a desperate effort to keep
from being thrown into a nose dive, that, unless
miraculously conquered, would be likely to
send them whirling down, to crash from a five
thousand foot ceiling, and thus bring about a
complete writeoff.</p>

<p class='c013'>That however was the least of Jack’s worries—all
he asked was the ability and luck to be
able to fend off threatening disaster; could this
be done successfully in good time they could
pick up all that was lost, and once more continue
their westward flight.</p>

<p class='c013'>The battering they endured was simply tremendous,
and Jack marveled at the ship being
able to withstand such a horrible strain. If
but a single strut gave way under all that pounding
it would mean starting a series of similar
mishaps such as would quickly render them incapable
of keeping aloft; and with this threat
hanging over their heads it can readily be understood
neither of the two could be in a comfortable
frame of mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still it is wonderful how men thus threatened
will continue to carry on, although in an almost
mechanical fashion, doing just the necessary
thing with each change of pace on the part of
the tricky storm, and meeting successfully every
near tragedy as it arises to clutch them in its
grip.</p>

<p class='c013'>No longer did Jack keep on climbing—it
seemed to him that the further the staggering
boat lifted the more dangerous became their
situation for the air was surcharged with electricity
as the zigzag lightning darted from cloud
to cloud, doubling the chances of their frail
craft being struck.</p>

<p class='c013'>In fact it seemed so terrible above that he
lacked the nerve to persist in the upward work,
and even commenced to drop down. Perk
noticing this move, hardly knew what to make
of it. He was, as he himself would have expressed
it, “hanging on by his teeth,” in order
to keep his seat in the wildly plunging airship
and on finding that the bold pilot had given up
hope of finding relief in the upper regions, the
fact appalled him. Could it be Jack had decided
to attempt a landing, with only the glare
of those repeated electrical flashes to serve as
airport lights? That indeed would be next to
admitting their case as hopeless, and that Jack
was taking such desperate chances only as a last
resort.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were zooming along all this time as if
pursued by a jinx and indeed with such weird
accompaniments it would not be hard to believe
the spirit of the storm took on the part of such a
goblin of the air, to pursue relentlessly this bold
invader of the home of the aroused elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk hit the bullseye close to the center when
afterwards, in describing their experience on
this night of the great blow, he vowed they were
“playing dice with death,” since it seemed a bare
chance that they could ever pull through alive.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such is the life of the aviator—one hour sailing
smoothly along, at peace with all mankind,
envying no man his following, and feeling himself
to be on the top of the world—the next and
he may be fighting with might and main the
mad demons of the air, his life hanging in the
balance, his strength ebbing fast, and unless the
little cherub aloft that is said to be watching
over each sailor, whether of the sea or the limitless
air, comes to the rescue, his fate is sealed,
and another modern Argonaut never comes back
again to the home port.</p>

<p class='c013'>It did not seem to be any the less exciting even
when they had succeeded in gaining a much
lower altitude; although possibly the danger
from those thunderbolts might have been somewhat
abated. Perk soon realized that his pilot
had no intention of trying for a landing in the
midst of such a turmoil and confusion, which
fact relieved his harried feelings to some extent.
Indeed, it would have been a mad proceeding,
and almost unheard of, since hardly the slightest
chance offered for the most skillful pilot to
reach the earth without disaster, such as making
a ground loop, and having the heavy engine bury
them under its weight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk endeavored to convince himself that
things were a bit easier since a lower altitude
had been effected but in so doing he feared he
was only deceiving himself—if anything at all
things were even worse,—although the drop
might not be so far, which was small comfort,
since it must mean their complete annihilation
if it befell them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had numerous spasms when he fancied
something was going amiss with their staunch
craft, although unable to decide the exact nature
of the imaginary trouble. Despite all these
chills, which must have been the products of his
excitement, they managed to hold out minute
after minute, which fact gave more or less cause
for renewed hope.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack must indeed be almost completely exhausted,
and yet he refused to give up the controls,
to which his hands seemed glued as though
riveted there. Perk punched his side numbers
of times, but could get no favorable response,
proving that the other deemed it too hazardous
a proceeding to change possession of the stick
while in the whirl of that shrieking gale—which
was indeed only another adaptation of the old
proverb “it is folly to change horses when crossing
a stream.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no means for communication with
each other, even though they may have wished
to do so, since the ear-phones had been discarded
with the donning of their slickers, and
could not be put back in position, owing to the
sudden bursting of the storm, and the necessity
for employing their hands in more useful pursuits.</p>

<p class='c013'>All Perk could do was to hang on, keeping
himself ready to seize hold should his companion
be suddenly compelled to release his grip
through sheer weariness—that, and keeping tabs
of the weather, so as to glean the first favorable
sign that came along, promising a let-up, or at
least a break.</p>

<p class='c013'>Judging from the heavy rain that had come
down in such a solid stream it must be reckoned
one of those dreadful cloud-bursts of which he,
Perk, had so often heard, but which thus far in
his experience he had never met up with. No
doubt rivers would be out of their beds long before
dawn although that angle of the situation
did not interest them in the least, since their
traveling would not be interfered with a particle,
if only the air proved inviting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yes, soon Perk believed he could detect a lessening
of the baffling crosswinds that had been
so trying to the pilot, keeping him continually
on the anxious seat—then, too, it struck him the
floods were growing weaker in the bargain;
which two facts gave poor Perk a feeling akin to
joy in the region of his heart, such as he may
have known on previous occasions, but that must
have been far down in his adventurous past.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to their altimeter they were something
like two thousand feet from the ground,
but of course never the faintest glimpse could
they secure of what lay beneath them, so poor
was the visibility, with all that torrent of water
pouring down as might a mountain cataract.</p>

<p class='c013'>This delightful feeling grew stronger as minutes
passed—at this rate he would soon be able
to influence tired Jack to renounce his frozen
hold on the stick, and turn the handling of the
ship over to his chum.</p>

<p class='c013'>In this frame of mind he again nudged the
other, but in turn received a negative shake of
the head, which meant there was “nothing doing”—in
other words, since the storm still raged,
even though in somewhat diminished violence,
they must not be too premature, and spoil it all
just when the victory seemed about to drop into
their hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>With what Perk hoped would prove to be a
last dying spurt the rain came pelting down,
after which it suddenly stopped as though an
unseen hand away up among the clouds, had
plugged the gap, and kept any more water from
running out—enough was enough, surely, Perk
was telling himself when he made this thrilling
discovery and for one he felt he had had sufficient
rain to last him the balance of that year.</p>

<p class='c013'>So too did the wind start to diminish its force,
also coming from one direction with more constancy—some
relief to Jack, that was certain,
since now he could know just how to steer his
turbulent craft so as to meet the force driving
against it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then what did Perk do but start getting his
ear-phones adjusted, being wild to hear a human
voice, after all that fiendish roaring and howling
kicked up by the raging elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>Why, already the atmosphere had cleared
enough for him to catch faint glimpses of what
lay beneath them—it looked as though they had
come to a stretch of country where the level
prairie had changed into rougher ground, with
deep swales, sometimes running into quite respectable
ravines and there were indications of
ridges ahead, which might even prove to be
fairly high, so that it would have been tempting
Providence had Jack dropped still lower, while
flying blind through all that welter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Talk to me ’bout luck,” the grateful Perk
was saying to himself, “I never ran ’cross anything
like <i>this</i>—they told me Jack must a been
born under a lucky star, an’ now I sure b’lieves
it to be the right stuff they were givin’ me, an’
no taffy either. But that was some fight, take
it from me, fellers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards Jack condescended to give
him the sign that he was willing to pass up the
job; whereat Perk quickly superseded him as
pilot, and saw the other sink back in his cramped
quarters as though unable to hold up his tired
arms a second longer. Apparently the relief
had come not a minute too soon, for he must have
been close to the point of utter exhaustion after
so long and violent a strain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Battered as the crate had been while the gale
lashed them so madly, it had stood up under the
buffeting most amazingly and Perk would
never have occasion to utter anything saving
words of praise for the model and its makers;
it must be as near perfection as aircraft are being
built these days of man’s victory over the
savage forces of the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Setting his course in what he believed to be the
proper direction Perk waited until Jack seemed
fairly well recovered, when he was pleased to
see the other take up his head harness as though
he too felt the necessity for opening up communications
with his running mate, which outlook
gratified Perk immensely.</p>

<p class='c013'>There were many things he wished to have
made clear, and besides, he felt more than curious
to learn what Jack’s next move might turn
out to be—that they had drifted far from their
original course went without saying but a means
must be found to recover the lost ground, after
which they could take up the game again just
where the sudden storm had caused such a diversion.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then the moon peeped out through a
break in the clouds overhead, as though to tell
them it was all over, with decent weather once
more in the offing.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch18' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVIII <br /> <br />THE DESERTED SHACK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Well, that’s somehow I guess over, and I’m
mighty glad,” was the way Perk voiced his feelings,
when the clouds were rolling away, and the
heavenly host of stars backed up the moon in
lighting up the firmament.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Same here,” echoed Jack, still more or less
tired after his energetic battle with the unleashed
elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And strikes me the air’s got some chilly,”
added the other; “I own up I’m shivering to
beat the band right now. Where d’ye figger we
might be, partner—must a lost our course in all
that kettle o’ rain an’ wind, an’ drifted far to
the south, eh, what, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question about it, Perk; I could feel the
pull right along; still, there wasn’t a thing to do
but let the old crate take the reins in her teeth.
Once morning comes we’ll manage somehow to
get a line on our locality, and swing back to our
course.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some hours off yet,” ventured Perk, whose
lips were indeed trembling, as if the chill was
beginning to get in its work—perhaps all that
recent excitement was helping to make him
shiver, as it often will, even in the case of the
most valiant of men.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack noticed this fact, even though he himself
experienced nothing similar, for some reason or
other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Perk, you ought to have a chance
to sit alongside a warm fire and dry off; the rain
must have got under your slicker, and I reckon
now you’re slopping around in water back there.
Something’s <i>got</i> to be done about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! boss, don’t bother ’bout me; I’m a
hard-shell you must know, an’ a little dampness
ain’t agoin’ to do me any harm, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just the same we’ll try and make a landing,”
continued the other, “if there’s half a chance;
all I’d want would be to stack up against a level
stretch of upland, where the drainage had carried
off all that flood.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, that sounds all to the good, boy but
what difference will it make, I want to know?
After such a storm it’s bound to be some cold
even away down here along the Texas-Arizona
line; they call them Northers, jest like I’ve heard
they do down in Florida. Forget it, partner—I’m
a tough guy, an’ ain’t wantin’ to be coddled
like a baby.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just the same I say we’re going to land, if
half a chance shows up,” affirmed the pilot, in
that set way of his. “We’ll find the stuff to build
some sort of fire, Perk, where you could make
a pot of hot coffee; which’d do you more good
than a switch of hard liquor. Put that in your
pipe and smoke it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk remained silent for almost two whole
minutes, during which time no doubt he was
revolving in his mind what Jack had proposed—in
imagination he could almost <i>smell</i> the delicious
aroma of the coffee, boiling so merrily
over the red coals and even feel a joyous sensation
of warmth stealing through his chilled body.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Okay, Jack; you win, hands down. Me for
the coffee every time, to be followed by a quiet
smoke o’ my fav’rite brand o’ tobac. Have your
own way about it, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then get ready to try and make out what
sort of ground we’ll soon be passing over,” added
Jack, as he turned the ship earthward, and slid
down on a long glide, with the motor clamped
shut. “We’ll skim along close enough for you
to get a good idea as to how matters stand, and
yet giving enough distance to keep clear of any
clump of trees, or little bald knobs of rises.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently Perk assured him he could manage
to get fair glimpses at what lay below; at which
Jack again started on an even keel, moving with
as little speed as was compatible with safety.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not very long before the watcher gave
tongue.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Looks good to me down yonder, partner—guess
now we might make a safe an’ sane landin’—’specially
with <i>you</i> at the stick. Circulate
a little bit to the south, brother, ’cause it looks
some better thataways.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This Jack did, and then at another signal from
the observer, he proceeded to drop down with
almost as much confidence as he might have felt
when making a landing on Candler Field, well
lighted, and with every convenience suited to
safety and comfort.</p>

<p class='c013'>His confidence, it seemed, had not been misplaced,
for they effected a very fair contact, all
things considered, even though the landing was
somewhat “joggly and rough” as Perk expressed
it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once the ship came to a stop and both of them
hastened to clamber out of their close quarters—“cribbed,
cabined and confined,” Jack sometimes
liked to say in connection with their limited
cockpit, although his pal always reminded him
of the fact that <i>cabin</i> was something only conspicuous
by its absence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk’s first movement was to start threshing
his arms against his thighs with more or less
vigor, in which he showed good common sense
since there is no better method for stirring up
sluggish circulation after a long period of inaction.
Jack on his part commenced to check
up on certain sections of the undergear, meaning
to make certain he had done no damage in making
connection with the earth under such unfavorable
conditions.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything in ship-shape, I reckon, Perk,”
he announced. “And now let’s make out to find
something in the line of trees, where we might
pick up enough wood for that fire.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Looks kinder like things’d be mighty well
soaked after all that downpour,” affirmed the
shrewd Yankee-Canadian; “so it’d be a tough
job coaxin’ stuff to take fire. But wait a minute,
partner—I didn’t get a chance to tell you that I
spied what looked like an ol’ tumbledown shack
over to windward—I guess now it might be
abandoned, but just the same, partner, we’d be
apt to run across some dry wood inside.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suppose you step over and take a look-in,
Perk,” suggested the other. “I’ll stand by the
crate here, and keep our little glim working, so
you’ll get your bearings when you start back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, Jack,” acceded the lanky one,
always eager for any sort of service; “an’ by the
same token now I’ll tote my gun along—never
c’n tell what sorter game you’ll stack up against
on these here Texas plains, I’m told. I feel like
I could knock over a wolf er two, just to get my
blood to movin’ at a faster clip—how ’bout it,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suit yourself, Perk,” he was told, as Jack
climbed back into the cockpit so as to manipulate
the light he mentioned, and which would prove
sufficient to serve the wanderer as a beacon when
wishing to retrace his steps.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly Perk wandered off, having decided
as to the quarter where he had glimpsed
what looked like an old and lonely shack or
cabin, faintly seen in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>He came back in a short time, bubbling over
with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all right, Jack—just like I guessed, it
turned out to be an ownerless shack but the roof
looks like it might’ve shed the rain, an’ oh! boy!
heaps o’ dry wood inside, with a whoppin’ big
fireplace where you could slap on the biggest
log agoin’. Mebbe I ain’t glad you thought o’
this game. Come along, an’ we’ll fetch the stuff
for a warm snack—coffee, crackers, an’ bacon
in the bargain. Talk to me about luck, it’s comin’
to us in big chunks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! we’ve got to get used to that sort of
thing,” said Jack, in the most matter-of-fact tone
imaginable; “when you’re on such a wonderful
lay as this anything’s likely to happen, and all
kinds of surprises spring out at you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder,” was all Perk could say in reply;
but he lost no time in gathering together such
articles as aluminum coffeepot, skillet, cups, and
such other things as he knew would be needed to
complete their little midnight spread.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon it’s safe for us to leave our crate
off here,” remarked the cautious Jack, “but I’ll
fix things so no busybody can take-off while we’re
away,” which he did without any trouble; after
which they both set out to move along to the
deserted shack Perk had located, lying right
there, just as if a favoring Fate had designed it
for their especial benefit in an emergency, as
the grateful Perk told himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Arriving at the humble shack, that once may
have housed a happy family in days that were
gone, they made use of Jack’s electric torch in
order to gather some dry splinters of wood,
which, heaped above some paper on the open
hearth, soon blazed up, and afforded them an
opportunity to take a look around.</p>

<p class='c013'>Other fuel more lasting was hurriedly added
to the fire, and this done the two air adventurers
took stock of their surroundings. There was
nothing much to see, since the shack happened
to be entirely devoid of any kind of furniture,
even of the most primitive make; but the roof
had stood the ravages of time, and promised to
hold out for years still to come.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk held out his chilled hands to the blaze
but only for a few minutes; apparently the possibility
of brewing some “nectar” was an overpowering
temptation, for presently he started to
work.</p>

<p class='c013'>In short order he had the steam coming out
of the coffee pot spout, and a most delightful
odor permeated the interior of that ancient
shack. When the coffee was ready, Perk poured
some of the amber fluid in both aluminum cups,
and offered Jack one, together with a freshly
opened carton of tempting crackers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goes right to the spot,” the self-made <i>chef</i>
observed, rubbing a hand across his stomach, as
though experiencing the most blissful sensation
there; “best coffee I ever tasted, barrin’ none,
an’ say, I’ve tried it a good many places like
France and Germany, as well as in Turkey too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Same here,” Jack assured him, as he drained
his first cup. “By the way, didn’t you say you’d
fetched some bacon along over here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jest what I did, partner, an’ now I’ve had
my fust swaller o’ coffee I’ll get a move on an’
soon have some o’ the same asizzlin’ in the pan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He started to carry out his words, with the
interested Jack watching his efforts to try and
make the frying pan set evenly on the fire, a feat
that requires considerable knowledge of camp
tactics in order to be successful. After one near
spill, with Perk only saving an upset by quick
work, Jack modestly broke in to give a bit of
advice, not forgetting, however, that old saying
about “too many cooks spoil the broth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too hot to keep hold of the handle looks like,
partner; now if only we were outdoors we might
find stones enough to form some sort of foundation
on three sides of the fire, where you could
rest your pan. Hold on, here’s this old hearth
that was made of some kind of Mexican bricks—adobe
they call them and it looks to me like
some of ’em might be loose. Here, I’ll manage to
pry a few up for you, Perk, old man—just hold—your—horses
and——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did not finish his sentence, and the cook,
glancing up to see what ailed him, found his
pal holding the first adobe in an uplifted hand,
while he was himself staring hard into the cavity
from which it had come, as if he saw something
wonderfully fascinating there!</p>

<p class='c012'>“I swan! what’s the matter, partner—my

<p class='c013'>Perk on his part was already sharing the excitement
of his pal, although apparently from
an entirely different reason. He had already
started to scramble to his knees, being doubtless
bent on taking some aggressive action, when he
saw Jack reach forward and deliberately pluck
some object from the hole under the displaced
adobe fire brick, and hold it up to view.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he saw its nature Perk’s jaw dropped, and
he was the picture of abject astonishment—but
it was far from being any poisonous reptile that
Jack was thus exhibiting with such a grand
flourish; just as though he might be some necromancer
or magician, and drawing all manner of
amazing things out of an apparently empty
stove-pipe hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gosh-a-mighty! that looks like real money!
I swan!” burst from Perk’s lips, as he continued
to stare.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just what it’s supposed to be, Pal Perk,”
said Jack, trying to keep his own voice from
displaying a genuine tremolo—“a neat wad of
it, waiting here for us to drop in and pick it up.
Seems like things might be set up, like tenpins
in the alley, for two lucky dogs to knock down
with a couple of rolled balls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If that don’t beat anything I ever did see,”
continued the astounded Perk, now grinning, as
though the pleasant nature of their find was
commencing to appeal to him. “Jest think o’ a
pair o’ air tramps ahappenin’ along, runnin’
across this here deserted shack, an’ findin’ a fortune
askin’ to be taken care of—don’t it beat the
Dutch what c’n happen—Arabian Night’s adventures
can’t hold a candle to the real thing in
these modern days. Some ol’ miser musta hid
that boodle under the bricks, so’s to keep the
Mex raiders comin’ up over the international
border from gettin’ their itchin’ fingers on it—how
’bout that, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Off color, I’m afraid, Perk,” Jack told him,
after taking a quick look at his wonderful find
in the hearth <i>cache</i>; “that miser story might go
with some but it doesn’t wash with me worth
a red cent. In the first place if this money had
been hidden here by a miser, he’d have taken it
away with him when he cut stick. Then again
it would surely have been partly in hard cash,
like gold eagles, and such stuff—all hoards of
misers, you remember, are made up like that,
Perk, and when you give this the once-over
you’ll also notice how it’s all in bills, mostly
fresh ones at that, as if they hadn’t seen much
circulation, as you might say.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk drew in a long breath, and continued to
stare hard at the object Jack was holding out in
front of him; it might be that something in the
other’s words and manner suggested certain possibilities
that seemed almost too staggering for
poor Perk to digest offhand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gee whittiker jewsharps! Jack—what’s this
you’re hintin’ at, ol’ pal—give it to me easy-like,
so I c’n swaller it—all in bills—mostly
fresh ones at that—not seen much handlin’
around—say, are you tryin’ to tell me they’re
every one five dollar bills,—Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon that’s what they are, Perk, I’d say,
from taking a quick look at the same.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bad currency—counterfeits—bogus stuff, er—what?”
gasped the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look for yourself, and you’ll recognize them
as having been printed from the same plates as
the one we’re carrying with us as a sample of
Slippery Slim’s best work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Je-ru-salem crickets! I’m knocked silly for
a fact,” whimpered Perk; and then, as if mustering
up his vanishing stamina he went on to add:
“but however could they’ve got right there under
that brick—conjurer’s black magic, looks
like to me, partner, it sure does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nonsense! that part of it is easy enough to
figure out,” asserted Jack, as usual very matter-of-fact;
“the only thing that seems to border on
the miraculous is our running across this packet
of all the people in the Far West—it looks to
me as if some sort of Destiny might be handling
the cards—that all we have to do is to keep moving
and everything’s bound to come our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure does seem like a snap, and that’s a fact,”
agreed Perk, calming down a little as he began
to grow more accustomed to the great discovery
that had resulted from their deciding to drop
down, and have a sociable cup of hot coffee;
“but I’ll be danged if I c’n make head or tail
out o’ this happening—now, what under the sun
did anybody want to stick that wad o’ long green
under the same adobes, I’d like to know, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! there might be any number of answers
to that question, Perk; for instance didn’t we
learn that it was the habit of Slim, or one of his
busy bees, to jump across the border every little
while with a load of the flimsy, and dole the stuff
out to a number of agents he has working with
him in this section of the country, also all the
way over to Los Angeles and San Diego?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was the spiel they gave us, for a fact,
boss,” admitted Perk, wagging his head eagerly,
as though he felt certain clever Jack would be
able to figure things out, and hit on some sort of
explanation that would cover these mysterious
happenings.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, this, then, might be one of his hidden
<i>caches</i>—at certain times this unknown agent
hides some <i>real</i> money in such a hole as this, and
comes along another dark night it might be to
pick up the big wad that was left in exchange
for the small one he contributed. And that is
the way the game runs, so I was told.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“By gum! but what grand luck for us to come
in on this deal, Jack—pretty soft, I’d call it,
and neither of us had any hand in it either—just
hit on this little bank by sheer chance! Goin’
to crib the loot, are you, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack scratched his head as though certain
plans were flitting through it, and he must make
a choice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, we have to start somewhere, you understand,
Perk, and it looks like the finger of
Fate might be pointing right at this shack, and
telling us to get busy and pick up a strong clue
that, if followed up, would take us straight to
that hideout Slim’s got across in Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess I see what you mean now, brother,”
ventured Perk, his face lighting up with extreme
joy; for he felt they were already on the track,
and that from that hour there must be rapid
action continuously. “If so be that ’ere critter
that slams out these bills on greenhorns and
come-ons is gettin’ anxious to see what sorter
prize he’s drawn in the lottery, why, he might
jest come along any ol’ time now, since the
storm’s over an’ there’s nawthin’ to hold him up.
Got any idea he’s nigh due here, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shouldn’t be a bit surprised if he walked in
on us any time,” ventured Jack; and then, seeing
the puzzled look on his chum’s rugged face
he went on to add: “I didn’t mention the fact
but while we were making our way over from
the ship I felt certain I glimpsed several far-off
lights, as if they might be in windows of cabins
or houses of some sort. Then, too, I surely did
hear a big dog barking, and something like a
rooster crowing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I’ll be jiggered if you ain’t got sharper
ears than I c’n boast, Jack, ol’ hoss, which ain’t
no lie either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t you believe it, Perk; it just happened
that you were so wrapped up in thinking of that
coffee treat you didn’t pay as much attention to
outside things as I did. So it seems as if there
might be some kind of a village or prairie town
not more than two miles from this abandoned
old shack and if that’s so then the chances are
this agent who’s been working the public for
Slim probably lives there. Then again, like as
not he has a pretty good idea about when his
bunch of kale ought to be placed under that
brick—in fact he might have made his way out
here this very night only for the storm threatening.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, partner,” Perk hastened to say, brimful
of energy, “which, bein’ the case, it’s up to
us to lay a sweet little mantrap, so’s to trip him
by the heels if so be he knocks on our door.
How’ll we fetch it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“First of all we’ll finish our supper, and clean
up here,” came the ready explanation; “he may
smell the odor of coffee and bacon, but then you
might expect this shelter to be used once in a
while by Mexican tramps, or passing cowboys,
especially when a big storm threatens, so that
isn’t going to scare the Johnny. As for us, we’ll
fix things so as to give him a nice little surprise,
by hiding out, after making things all dark inside
here, with water thrown on the fire to
smother the hot coals, after which there’s nothing
to do but take things easy until he shows up—if
he does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sabbe, okay, partner; let’s get busy, for
the bacon’s done brown to a turn.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch20' class='c014'>CHAPTER XX <br /> <br />SPRINGING THE TRAP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There was much that must be done before they
could feel satisfied they had their mantrap arranged.
Jack realized that if the party who
played the part of local agent for the counterfeiter
gang had been kept from coming to secure
the fresh supply of bogus bills by the threatening
storm, he was likely to make his appearance
at almost any time, since all danger from the
electrical disturbance was now past.</p>

<p class='c013'>They finished their little supper without
wasting any more time, after which the matter
of hiding all traces of their presence was taken
up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See if you can find any water outdoors,
Perk,” Jack was saying, as he contemplated the
red embers of their late fire. “Seems to me I
stepped in some sort of a puddle while coming
up to the door. Here’s an old rusty can that
looks as if it’d hold a quantity—I want to dash
it on these coals so as to cool them off. That
done we’ll find some way to hide, and watch developments.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk sized up the situation cleverly enough,
and lost no time in setting about doing as his pal
suggested. When he came back he was carrying
the rusty can, which did leak a trifle, but
then that made no particular difference, so long
as enough water remained to put the fire out.</p>

<p class='c013'>It sizzled, and steamed a bit but Perk distributed
the fluid contents of his can with such
discretion that all this was speedily brought to
a finish, with the last red ember cooled off, leaving
a dead little pile of wood ashes as the only
reminder of their blaze.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now that’s settled, partner,” said the always
ready Perk, “what comes next on our program?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had his hand electric torch in use, for
otherwise they must have been left to grope
around, since the clouds continued to drift past
in clusters, shutting out most of the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We must gather up everything here that
might give us away, for like as not the fellow’ll
fetch some kind of a light along with him—lantern
it may turn out to be, because he knows its
apt to be pretty dark inside the old shack, and
he can’t do much just by fumbling around.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! that’s right, boss,” returned Perk,
commencing to gather up any and all their
scanty belongings, not forgetting that convenient
rifle of his. “But I say, how ’bout the bus—won’t
he lamp the thing settin’ there in the open
an’ ain’t it apt to give him a bad start?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had duly considered that very point in
making up his plans, and was ready to meet the
situation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Taken it all in all, buddy, there’s small danger
of that happening,” he went on to tell Perk.
“First, remember, the ship lies on that side of
the shack away from the spot where I glimpsed
those lights and if he comes along in a direct
line from the town there isn’t one chance in three
of him noticing it. Even if he does I reckon
he’ll feel dead certain only his own messenger’d
be flying in this region—he may never have seen
another crate besides the one sent out by Slippery
Slim.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She sounds good to me, Jack an’ I’m willin’
to take a shy at the target, if so be you guess it’s
straight goods, all wool’n a yard wide. Let’s
go!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly both passed out of the deserted
shack that had proved such a fortunate harbor
for them after the late storm. Jack knew what
they must do in following up the little plan he
had framed, with a view of giving the suspect
the shock of his life and without any further
preliminaries he set about carrying out the few
details.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a chink or two in this further wall,”
he went on to say, in a low voice, next door to a
whisper, “that will furnish us means for keeping
tabs on what’s going on inside. We’ll settle down
there, and just wait. As luck has it that side of
the shack is away from the moon, which is all in
our favor, in fact everything seems to be arranged
just to suit our plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bully set-up, boss, couldn’t be better for a
fact,” agreed the hopeful Perk, who firmly believed
in the element of Luck, and was immensely
gratified to discover how that little god
was working over-time in their favor—according
to his way of thinking it was always “better
to be born lucky than rich.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it?” whispered Jack, after they
had commenced to crouch down in the darkened
spot he had selected.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just great, that’s all,” Perk assured him,
“show me where one o’ them cracks c’n be located,
partner, an’ then I’ll be okay—all
fixed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack obliged by directing his chum’s hand to
an opening, through which it would be easy
enough to keep watch over any happening inside
the shack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Next we’ll creep over to this further corner,
and try to find out when he comes along,”
continued Jack. “From now on, Perk, keep
your tongue between your teeth—no talking, remember,
but if it does seem to be absolutely
necessary, put your lips close to my ear, and
whisper—get that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nuff sed, boss, I’m on,” came faintly from
the figure crouching at Jack’s side, after which
abject silence fell upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>A little later on Perk, now that his hearing
was strained so as to pick up any kind of sound,
however slight, caught the barking of a watchdog;
it seemed to be at a considerable distance
from the shack, and he judged there might be a
couple of miles lying between. This was not a
great amount of ground to cover, if only the inducement
were sufficiently urgent and that fat
packet of enticing bank bills, supposed to be
secreted under the adobes of the old hearth, must
represent an alluring prize, capable of drawing
a chap who was fond of “easy money” out of his
snug home at this unseasonable hour of the
night, and indulging in a little hike, for which
effort he would fancy himself well repaid.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some time passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>They lay there just back of the comer of the
dilapidated and abandoned shack, waiting, listening,
and frequently feeling a little thrill when
some soft sound came stealing to their ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Perk plainly heard what was surely a
low cough, such as might be caused by a sudden
tickling in the throat. Some one was undoubtedly
approaching the spot, and coming from the
west, where they understood the prairie hamlet,
or village, lay at the foot of a small ridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>He merely touched his companion’s right arm
to let Jack know something was in the wind.
The cough was repeated, so that Perk chuckled
softly to himself, as if more than ever convinced
that luck was bent on handing them out further
fat plums.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was already creeping back so as to reach
the spot where those convenient peepholes could
be found and of course Perk imitated his example.
Thus it came about they were in complete
readiness to make good use of their eyes
when a slight scratching sound came from
within, and a tiny flash announced that the newcomer
had struck a match.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk could see him there down on his knees,
and intent on applying his lighted match to the
wick of a lantern he had evidently fetched along
for this very purpose. If Perk could have analyzed
the feeling that possessed him just then he
must have compared it to the exultation of a cat
when about to make a jump upon a sparrow,
close up to which he had managed to hide, all
prepared for the finishing act of the ambush.</p>

<p class='c013'>No sooner had the man succeeded in lighting
his lantern than with eager hands he commenced
lifting the adobe under which Jack had again
artfully placed the bait in the shape of that
tempting packet of bogus notes.</p>

<p class='c013'>How eagerly he pounced on the contents of
his queer <i>cache</i>, all the avariciousness of a miser
handling his hoard was displayed and at the
same time he looked hurriedly from one side to
the other, as though his guilty soul, conscious of
having thus broken the law of his country, was
already seeing the long arm of Justice stretching
out menacingly toward him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack evidently had seen enough to satisfy him
the genuine criminal was in focus, and that there
could be no miscarriage of Justice in effecting
his capture with the goods upon him. He was
creeping toward the open door of the shack, evidently
bent on taking the slick partner of the
counterfeiter chief by surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk lost no time in crawling at his pal’s heels,
bent on having a hand in the closing scene of the
little drama—he wanted to see with his own
eyes just how such a slimy beast would take his
“bump” when he found the meshes of the net
closing around him.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon looking in at the open door.
The man still knelt there on the hard earthen
floor of the shack, and appeared to be nervously
fumbling the sheaf of bills, as though trying to
count them, and be assured that he had received
the full amount to which he was entitled—that
there had been no “holdout” attempted.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps one of them happened to make a
slight sound—either that, or else the man’s guilty
soul caused him to fancy he heard something
for he turned his head. It chanced that the
light of the lantern fell full upon his dark face,
and disclosed the distended eyes filled with terror,
as well as the expression so ghastly that
passed athwart his countenance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put ’em up!” commanded Jack, sharply, in
a voice that would brook no nonsense and as if
mechanically influenced to obey, the wretched
trapped distributor of bad notes raised both
hands, the packet falling to the floor as if his
nerveless fingers could no longer retain their
grip.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and Perk stepped blithely into the
lighted shack, the former with his ready automatic
covering the badly shaken rogue, Perk
trailing his rifle in a suggestive way, as if able
to back his boss up on the slightest provocation.</p>

<p class='c013'>First frisking the other, and removing a gun
from his back pocket, Jack made a motion with
his hand as he set Perk to work.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get the bracelets on him, partner, then we’ll
ask him a few leading questions before we make
up our minds what the next step’ll be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But—hold on, Mister,” whined the poor
devil, all aquiver as he groveled there on his
knees; “I ain’t done nawthin’—this hear ain’t
my stuff—I jest suspicioned Jud he must a had
somethin’ hid out this way, ’case he kep’ comin’
an’ agoin’, so I kim tuh see what it mout be. Now
I knows he must a robbed thet bank over in
Tucson when he went off with a gang he runs
with.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stow that gab,” said the disgusted Perk,
“that’s all too flimsy to wash. We got you to
rights an’ where the hair’s short, an’ you’ll have
a chanct to see what the inside o’ the pen at Atlanta’s
like. This here’s counterfeit long-green,
an’ you knows it, mister,” with which cutting
remark he snapped a pair of steel handcuffs
upon the other’s wrists with the skill only one
accustomed to handling such “safety-first” contraptions
could display, proving that for one of
Slippery Slim’s active lieutenants the show was
indeed over.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch21' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXI <br /> <br />PICKING UP CLUES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>By this time the man whom Uncle Sam’s two
clever sky detectives had trapped, showed signs
of being almost in a state of collapse. Too late
did he realize what a terrible mistake he had
made when yielding to the blandishments of
Slippery Slim Garrabrant, and acting under the
belief that he could defy the law and get away
with it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the big idea, partner,” Perk was asking
after he and Jack had fixed things so there
was no possible chance for their prisoner to
break away, and give them the laugh. “Do we
jump off right now, or wait till mornin’, I’d like
to know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No hurry at all,” was the calm reply, “I
want to go over our crate once more before we
start that hop across to the California border,
I’ve good reason to believe things are okay but
a second overhauling will satisfy me better.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I kinder guess you won’t want me to slip
over to this here town, an’ pick up a few fresh
eggs, eh, boss?” and Perk’s voice actually took
on a wheedling vein as he made this remark
for if there was anything he dearly loved along
the line of “eats” it was those same “fresh eggs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack shook his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hardly think it would be wise,” he observed;
“we don’t know the lay of the land for one thing—it
might be this party has some backing among
his neighbors, and we’d find ourselves in a hornets’
nest before we knew what was what. No,
we can stick it out here the balance of the night,
which is pretty well gone right now, and be off
about sunrise.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a lot more stuff around in here that’d
burn right well,” insinuated Perk; “how ’bout
another bit o’ fire—this night air feels some cool
to me an’ ’sides, we’d have a blaze ready so’s to
boil more coffee ’fore we kick off, eh, what,
partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Please yourself so far as that goes, Perk, I
reckon it wouldn’t feel at all bad to have some
fire, as we must hang out here several hours.
But don’t make any noise if you can help it.
Besides, we ought to keep an eye out for trouble,
no telling what this slick chap might work off
on us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! we’ll one o’ us keep watch off’n on,”
promised Perk, starting without any further delay
to gather some fuel, and get a blaze going.</p>

<p class='c013'>While he was thus engaged Jack took their
prisoner in hand, and commenced to grill him.
There was nothing of the dreaded “third degree”
rough-house measures in what Jack attempted
but he tried to show the man where his best interests
lay.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re in a bad fix, my friend,” Jack told
him: “and unless you come clean, so as to help
us round up the balance of your outfit, you’ll
be certain to get the full penalty the law lays
down. We know a whole lot about Slippery
Slim and his ways, and are dead certain we’re
bound to end up his graft before many more
days pass by. So when you’re answering my
questions don’t try to lie to me, for like as not
I’ll be already acquainted with the facts and
know you’re trying to beat around the bush.
Dangerous business, let me tell you; far better
for you to hold your tongue than deceive me.
Come clean, and I promise you I’ll do everything
in my power to have you let off easy, besides no
one need know you’ve turned State’s evidence.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he started in to put pointed questions,
concerning certain points that were vital to his
plans. Once he caught the man squirming under
the lash, and giving an answer that he very well
knew was like “beating around the bush.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know better than that, my friend,” he
told him sharply, “that’s only half a truth you’ve
given me. Don’t try it again if you know what’s
good for your health, or it’ll be a matter of possibly
ten years before you see your family again.
Stick to the truth, and it may be only a question
of six months you’ll spend at Atlanta behind the
bars. Now tell me again what I wanted to know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He had managed to impress his strong personality
upon the writhing wretch, who was
ready to throw himself unreservedly upon his
mercy and so the answers were given without
hesitation, although in some instances the man
declared he did not know, as he had only once
been across the line and visited Slippery Slim
in his hideout among the Mexican mountains.</p>

<p class='c013'>When Jack realized that he had really pumped
the other dry, he felt he had profited in many
ways and that their sudden determination to
make, a night landing, so as to recover after their
buffeting by the storm, had been a most fortunate
happening indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>For one thing he had learned that the name
of their frightened prisoner was Simeon Hawkins,
and that he had a wife and several children
living in the little prairie town only a few miles
distant—a fact that seemed to give him great
distress, now he found his avaricious dreams
wrecked, and himself in the hands of a couple
of those very same Secret Service detectives
whom the “big boss” had undoubtedly referred
to so contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had been “listening in,” and chuckling
happily whenever he realized his mate had made
some sort of a “ten-strike,” picking up valuable
information that was destined to ultimately
serve their ends wonderfully, and help to “pot
their game.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They sat there for some time, talking in low
tones. The man who lay close by helpless was
silent as a rule, although several times he uttered
a dismal groan, when his feelings overpowered
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess I’ll step out, partner,” remarked Perk
at one time, “an’ slip over to the ship, I’d sure
hate to have some critter do us a bad turn by
meddlin’ with any o’ them dials an’ gadgets.
What I wouldn’t do to <i>him</i> would be a caution,
that’s right.”</p>

<p class='c013'>From the fact that Perk carried his rifle along
with him his meaning was not difficult to understand
and Jack felt sorry for the chap who was
at the other end of the gun sights when his pal
pulled the trigger.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk cautiously approached the grounded
ship, and started when discovering some moving
object just in its shadow. The moon was shining
brightly now, so that it was an easy matter to see
for quite some little distance, although so deceptive
was the light that even sharp-eyed Perk
could hardly have told whether some dark object
seen fifty feet off was a stump or a black dog
sitting there and watching him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Waiting until the object moved again, he discovered
he had been wise to hold his fire, for by
then he had made it out to be some species of
animal. He took several forward steps, whereupon
the beast started to move off, uttering a
little nasty snarl while doing so.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks, on’y a stinkin’ kiote after all, skulkin’
’round to see if he c’n stir up a little grub o’ any
kind. Get out, you varmint!” and he waved his
gun above his head while starting to run forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>This completely demoralized the cowardly
prairie marauder, so that he took to his heels,
and quickly vanished in the near distance. Perk
found everything all right when he gave the
stranded plane “the once over”; and being satisfied
that there was nothing to be feared from a
coyote prowling around in search of a supper or
breakfast, he returned to the shack to report all
well.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was busily engaged making certain notes,
and reading others connected with their present
business, as jotted down in his memorandum
book in a peculiar brand of short-hand all his
own, but which would appear as so much Greek
or Choctaw to any one else.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Better turn in, and get a few winks of sleep,
brother,” he told Perk, who had yawned once or
twice as he sat before the fire. “I’ll wake you up
in about an hour or so when you can take your
turn playing sentinel, until the dawn shows up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just as you say, old hoss,” came the ready
reply; “fact is, I’m a bit drowsy, an’ could get
away with a few winks; but don’t forget to wake
me when the hour’s up, remember.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s all right, partner,” Jack told him,
laughingly; “we’re in this game thirty-thirty,
and you’ll have your turn, depend on it. Now
get busy, and don’t you dare snore above a whisper
either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I do jest gimme a poke, Jack—tryin’ to
break myself o’ that nasty habit but I got to
have help, you know—no feller ain’t wholly responsible
fur what he does when he’s asleep.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In due time Jack aroused the other, and himself
sought a brief period of forgetfulness in
sleep. So the balance of the night passed, and
morning came with a clear sky, and a promise of
decent weather for the continuance of their
flight.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch22' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXII <br /> <br />OVER ARIZONA DESERTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Perk must have dreamed about that hot coffee
treat he had been promising himself, for when
Jack opened his eyes he found his comrade already
watching the bubbling pot, from which
delightful odors were commencing to escape in
the way of steam.</p>

<p class='c013'>They enjoyed quite a decent little breakfast,
what with the ambrosia contained in their aluminum
cups together with some crackers and jam,
after the crisp bacon had been disposed of. Jack
offered some to their prisoner, but the man sadly
shook his head, as if to say he had no appetite
whatever.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was not a bad looking fellow, only with a
weak sort of chin, and evidently built along a
line that could be easily tempted to go wrong if
the inducement were only gilded enough. Jack
felt sorry for him, especially since he had learned
about his family; and was determined to do what
he could so as to get Simeon off, should his information
prove of any value to their cause.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once breakfast was disposed of they all went
over to where the ship lay. By this time Simeon
had found that they really planned to carry him
off with them, a startling fact that added to his
alarm, for apparently he had never been up in
a plane, and a species of stage-fright made him
shake as if he had the ague.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there was no other way to work things,
for should they set him free the chances were
the man, forgetting his promise, would try to
send out some kind of warning to Slippery Slim,
and in the end he and Perk were apt to pay dearly
for their slip-up, perhaps even with their own
lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>When playing such a desperate game with so
canny a lawbreaker it would be the height of
folly to let the dictates of tender hearts turn
them from the path of “safety first,” and Simeon
must continue to “take his medicine,” even
though the innocent ones at home suffered for
his misdeeds—he had never considered others
whom his evil actions had doubtless harmed,
when they found themselves arrested for passing
worthless bills, and how could he expect these
sworn officers of the law to go easy with him
when caught in the act?</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk now began to wonder just how they
would be able to “tote” a third party in the limited
accommodations afforded by the double
cockpit of their ship. It was bound to prove a
tight squeeze, and not so comfortable but then
why grumble on account of a trifle like that,
when Fortune was giving them such a glad hand
all the while?</p>

<p class='c013'>He began to shift things around some while
Jack was busy checking the motor, struts, undergear,
and propeller, with the design of condensing,
and making more room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Funny how you c’n jam things into such a
small compass when you really an’ truly try,”
he told Jack, when he had finished his task. “I
kinder guess I’ll be able to fix him okay, ’cause
he’s no great shakes at size, an’, seems like to
me, he’s shrinkin’ right afore my eyes, he’s that
shaky. Then it’s only for the day, I figger; how
’bout that, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve planned all that out, partner,” he was
told. “As soon as we get over to the California
border we’ll give him in charge of some sheriff
to keep in the hoosgow till we’ve made our killing,
and are ready to deliver the whole batch to
Uncle Sam’s nearest U. S. District Attorney,
at Los Angeles or San Diego. That clear to you,
Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say it was, boss, an’ here’s hopin’ we’ll
get there with both feet when the end shows up,
our prisoners hobbled, an’ with nice new steel
bracelets decoratin’ their wrists. Now to get
the gent aboard the boat, an’ stowed away.
Shucks! he acts like he might be scared out o’ a
year’s growth—some sillies get that way ’bout
goin’ up in a skyscraper the fust time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>His scorn for such a weakling showed in his
face as he helped Simeon to clamber into the
cockpit. The man was as white as a sheet, and
trembling as if expecting to meet with some dire
end in short order, once he left the firm ground
and took to the boundless air. His groans were
heartrending, and Jack felt sorry for the wretch
but for once Perk displayed no signs of sympathy,
it was all so silly in his opinion.</p>

<p class='c013'>He proceeded to take precautions by fastening
the greenhorn in by means of a stout strap which
would prevent his falling out should conditions
necessitate a sudden banking on the part of the
pilot, or a fierce gust of wind cause the ship to
give a unannounced plunge.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All ready, Jack,” announced Perk, after
completing these arrangements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll be with you inside of three minutes,” he
was told, and as the ground ahead had been examined,
and found to be fairly good for the
wheels to trundle over, there seemed to be nothing
more that could be done, only put things to
the test.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was “some rough,” as Perk told himself,
when violently shaken once or twice but they
managed to get up sufficient speed to admit of
Jack lifting her when the right time arrived.
Then they were off, rising like a bird, and almost
immediately opening up the village that nestled
there two miles off, at the foot of the low ridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack headed straight into the west, for that
was their route “as the crow flew.” He cared
not at all that they would pass directly over the
settlement, for few of the people were apt to be
abroad at such an early hour, nor would they
be any the wiser for seeing a plane pass overhead
at such a low altitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, looking down, found himself wondering
which of the modest cottages in line of his vision
chanced to be the home Simeon had spoken of
with such a catch in his voice. The man had
temporarily forgotten about his fears concerning
his own safety, while being carried so high above
the surface of the earth—he was stretching his
neck, and eagerly focussing his staring eyes on
one spot, which evidently held all that he held
dear. Perk ignored his recent sensation of scorn,
and actually felt sorry for the man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor guy,” he was saying under his breath,
though the other could not have heard him had
he shouted at the top of his lungs, on account of
the racket being kicked up by combined motor
and propeller, “he feels right bad ’cause he’s
goin’ off without a chanct to say goodbye. Well,
I on’y hope this will be a lesson to Simeon, an’
he’ll quit playin’ with a buzz-saw, which is the
long arm o’ our Uncle Samuel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon tried his best to keep tabs of the lonely
little hamlet until it was no longer possible to
distinguish objects, owing to the several miles
of distance the speeding plane had covered; then
he fell back in his seat, and let his head drop
on his chest, while his body shook with emotion.
In that dreadful moment he would undoubtedly
have only too gladly given all he had in the wide
world for a chance to undo the wrongs he had
committed in his haste to get rich.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! he orter thought o’ that before, while
the goin’ was good!” was Perk’s comment, who
had seen just such short-sighted men more than
once before in his eventful life, and had a philosophical
mind concerning all such late repentances.
“But I’m sure sorry for them that are
agoin’ to suffer the most—he deserves all he’ll
get, but they’re the innocent ducks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The plane soared along its set course, and as
they were not at more than something like five
thousand feet altitude, Perk could see very well,
when he adjusted the binoculars they carried of
necessity, so as to be able to spy out conditions
before trusting themselves to land, being naturally
a bit suspicious while thus drawing steadily
nearer to what might well be called enemy land.</p>

<p class='c013'>From time to time he found himself gazing
down with considerable curiosity upon scenes
which were mostly foreign to his eyes—he had
only too often scrutinized pictures where uncounted
troops belonging to the enemy were encamped,
or on the march, with monster guns
making the very air quiver with the tumult of
their discharges; where rival pilots came up in
answer to his insulting challenge, to engage him
in deadly combat—he had seen many an unlucky
or less skillful airman go down with his whirling,
blazing coffin, yielding up his life as a tribute
to what he called patriotism—all these and a
multitude of similar thrilling spectacles could
be unrolled in memory as he thus sailed the
azure sky, and saw Jack meet and conquer successive
air pockets lying in wait to give him battle;
and yet this was actually the first time Perk
had ever focussed his gaze upon a genuine cattle
ranch, and saw stock being driven to market,
or it might be mavericks branded; so that he
found himself entranced with the panorama
spread before him as they glided over the prairies
of New Mexico.</p>

<p class='c013'>There cropped up other and like interesting
sights when the wilder sector of country was
reached, with its deep gullies, its bare-topped
mountain peaks—perhaps stretches of desolate
desert where nothing could be seen save billowy
sandy wastes, except possibly patches of yucca,
sage, greasewood, and prickly pear cactus.</p>

<p class='c013'>When, his interest increasing, Perk begged
his comrade to drop down so as to give him a
nearer view of these strange sights, he was able
to increase his knowledge concerning the myriad
of strange sights to be picked up when touring
by air in new territories—now he could make
out the fantastic Joshua trees that seemed to be
engaged in a shimmering dance in the blazing
sunlight; moving shadows that sometimes crossed
the line of his vision he made out to be buzzards
on the wing, circling in search of their carrion
meal; while others on the ground he recognized
as coyotes skulking along, frightened by the sight
and noise coming from far over their heads, and
trying to reach their secret dens in some rocky
canyon or defile.</p>

<p class='c013'>Noon came in due time, with the ship keeping
up its steady grind, and having left hundreds of
miles in its wake.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk began to realize that he had eaten his
breakfast at an unearthly hour, and concluding
that a bite of something, together with a swig of
water from their jug, might go well, he mentioned
the interesting fact that the usual lunch
hour had come, at which Jack nodded his head,
as if to leave all that sort of thing to the discretion
of his trusted pard.</p>

<p class='c013'>So they had a pick-up snack, which was quite
acceptable to the two airmen, able to enjoy their
meals even while cutting capers up among the
clouds. It was another thing to the novice
Simeon, whose appetite had not come back,
though he did manage to swallow a few bites,
and have a drink of cold water to wash things
down. By slow degrees he was getting the upper
hand of his dreadful fears, for while familiarity
could not be said to bring contempt, nevertheless
he was becoming accustomed to the conditions,
and could even display a trace of curiosity
when looking down on some unusually interesting
spectacle to which Perk was pointing so
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>If things continued to exist as they had been
doing all morning it was likely—Jack at one time
told his co-pilot in answer to a question—that
they would be close to the California border by
sunset, or shortly afterwards; since even then
they were well along across Arizona, with fair
skies still beckoning them on their way.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch23' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIII <br /> <br />ON TO THE COLORADO</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Listen, Perk, I’ve got something you should
know—something that hinges on a change of
plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was saying this at a time when, relieved
from the controls he could enter into one of the
little confabs that their use of the ear-phones
allowed. All Perk had to do was to lean forward
and while still handling the stick drink
in whatever his co-pilot chose to say.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! spit it out then, partner,” was his familiar
way of inviting confidence and which
meant so much with those who knew Perk’s peculiar
sayings best.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be sure Simeon Hawkins was sitting close
beside Perk, and what Jack meant to confide in
his running mate could never be intended for
his ears but despite this elbow to elbow touch
there was not the slightest risk of his being able
to pick up a single word, owing to the clamor
kicked up by motor exhaust and propeller.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re going on a bit further than was arranged,”
said Jack, concisely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! meanin’ we don’t pull up when we
strike the border, eh, what, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just that, brother—the going is good, and
we might as well keep moving till we drop down
on the Metropolitan Airport grounds.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whoopee! you mean at Los Angeles, don’t
you, old hoss?” demanded Perk, apparently considerably
surprised by his pal’s bald statement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Righto, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How come, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get this fixed in your noodle,” said the resting
chief pilot—“circumstances often alter cases,
they tell us; well, when we figured on halting at
or near the border, close to the Gila River,
things hadn’t happened such as have hit us since
then.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Meanin’ the storm, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was one thing,” admitted the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Knockin’ us out o’ our reckonin’, like, an’
makin’ us take a forced landin’ on the open
prairie where we run across that flimsy ol’ shack—does
that cover what you mean, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“After a fashion it does,” the other told him,
adding: “like the play of Hamlet, with Hamlet
left out, it falls flat. You omitted the chief reason
for my making this change in plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess you must mean Simeon here, eh
boy?” asked Perk, as if suddenly waking up to
the fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing—what are we going to do with
<i>him</i>, tell me, Perk? It’d be impossible for us
to lug him everywhere we mean to go, flying
across into Mexico, and baiting the wolf in his
own lair, as you might say. He’d be a constant
hindrance to our being free to act besides, we’d
run a fat chance of having him give us away,
just when we thought it was all over but the
shouting.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, Jack—it means you don’t trust his
promises to lend us a helpin’ hand, and goin’
back on his pals—ain’t that the idea?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it,” replied Jack, never bothering
to drop his voice a particle, knowing as he did
that without the aid of those valuable ear-phones
Simeon, humped up against the side of Perk,
could not have caught what was said even
though it had been shouted at the top of his
voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what then, partner?” continued Perk,
apparently still groping in the dark.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing to hinder our tripping right along
till we fetch up at Angeles, when we can find a
way to hand him over to the Federal agents located
there. He’s connected with the big gang
against which Uncle Sam’s declared war to the
knife; and as a material witness, ready to turn
State’s evidence, they’ll be only too well pleased
to hold him <i>incommunicado</i>, so he can’t do a
thing to warn the bunch the big push is on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Okay, Jack. Sounds mighty good to me,
you bet. I’d never a cudgeled my brains enough
to hatch up an idea like that; takes you to think
o’ clever dodges, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then we’ll consider it settled, eh, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just what we will,” came the confident reply.
“’Bout when ought we raise the last beacon
on the road to Angeles, an’ lamp the field
lights at that same Metropolitan Airport?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! if everything goes well, you might call
it along toward midnight,” Jack assured him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got aplenty o’ gas to carry on that far, I’d
guess?” hazarded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s to be hoped so,” said Jack; “because
there’s some mighty tough stretches of country
between the Colorado and the big Pacific city.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! so I understand, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And it would be a bad job for us if we had
to hit the ground where you couldn’t scrape up
a decent landing place with a fine-tooth comb.
When I take the stick again, Perk, maybe you’d
better have a look in, so’s to get tabs on our fuel
tank, and tell me how it stands. From the dial
finger yonder I figure we’ll have a lot more than
enough to see us through.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s right, boss,” affirmed Perk, after casting
a hasty glance at the tell-tale figures so
plainly marked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That settles it then,” with which remark
Jack showed by his actions that further conversation
was needless.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Simeon sat there through it all, never
once dreaming how his fate was being so calmly
settled; doubtless he imagined the consultation
had been about something connected with the
running of the cloud-chaser, and covered facts
such as would have been all Greek to him, even
had he been able to listen in.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was not at all bothered by this change
of plans on the part of the head pilot—it mattered
little when they managed to drop down at
the airport—chances were the ground lights
were kept on full through the whole of each
night, since air mail planes would be apt to
come and go, some of them having been thrown
out of their regular schedules by dense mountain
fogs, or head winds that cut down the customary
speed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, also, was well acquainted with the
courtesy to be encountered at all such well conducted
flying fields, where every one would be
eager to do whatever was possible for the comfort
of those who chose to visit such ports, and
show little or no undo curiosity connected with
the reason for their coming.</p>

<p class='c013'>True, they might turn out to be a bit short
with the “eats;” but Perk, who knew the ways
of his pal so well, felt certain Jack would see to
it they had a chance to “fill up” as soon as they
could strike an open restaurant, of which there
should be no lack in such a wide-open city as
Los Angeles, with its sporty crowds at Hollywood.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was moving on apace, and
there cropped up fresh thrilling sights every little
while, for Perk to stare at through his useful
glasses. They were following the course of
the famous Gila River toward its confluence
with the still better known Colorado, which
hundreds of miles further north passed through
the Grand Canyon country, most majestic in a
panorama sense of any region on the face of the
globe.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along about nightfall they might expect to
pass over Yuma, located close to the junction of
the two rivers. Perk wondered once or twice
why his pal had not decided to land there, and
turn the prisoner over to some one in authority;
but he felt certain Jack had good reasons for
not attempting this.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe, now,” Perk told himself, with Jack
again running the ship, while he attended to
some of his own manifold duties; “he
guessed there might be a bad crowd at Yuma—fellers
apt to be in cahoots with the same
gang o’ daredevils Simeon here was connected
with; and who might even try to effect his escape,
so as to shut his trap—even go so far as to
knife the poor skunk to make sure he didn’t
peach. Oh! yeah, that’s the way Jack looked
at it, bet your boots it must be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Soon afterwards the sun gave notice that it
was about to withdraw behind the line of mountains
lying toward the west. Jack had his bearings,
and expected to be able to pick up the flash
beacons arranged for the convenience of the air
mail corps in their night flights to and from Los
Angeles. So thoroughly has this all been
mapped out, with the signals to be found about
every ten miles, that a pilot can see as many as
three ahead at one time, depending on the altitude
at which he may be flying.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such wise precautions had been taken that
would make night flying just as safe and easy as
during the daytime one thing only cropping up
from time to time to raise trouble, and cause delay
was the presence of the fogs that were apt
to rise from the deep canyons, to blot out those
friendly gleams of flashing light marking the
air mail course from start to finish.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch24' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIV <br /> <br />SIMEON GROWS DESPERATE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was commencing to grow dusk when they
sighted the lights of Yuma, that town on the railroad
leading to Los Angeles. Such a thing as a
plane flying overhead was so common these modern
days as to hardly excite any comment—they
came and went, with seldom anything out of the
usual taking place although not so very far
away, among the mountains, one of the most
dreadful of all air tragedies known to the annals
of flying had taken place, when the great
liner <i>City of San Francisco</i>, lost in a storm,
struck head-on against a rocky cliff, shattering
the ship and causing the death of every one of
those aboard, some seven souls in all.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now they had left Yuma far in their rear, and
Jack was watching to pick up the first flash beacon
on the way to the Coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>The weather continued to favor them, the
heavens being almost devoid of any semblance of
clouds, and the air quite cool at the height they
maintained while heading into the beckoning
west.</p>

<p class='c013'>Over deserts and mountainous stretches they
kept swinging along, to the constant accompaniment
of the customary chorus of a bustling plane
threading the mighty air lanes of the skies. The
silvery stars came out in battalions to sprinkle
the azure heavens like innumerable bright lanterns,
such as could be seen in Old Japan during
carnival times.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was the life, Perk told himself again and
again, sitting there after he had munched his
scanty portion of their meagre supper, Simeon
having again declined to share with them—what
air pilot who has tasted of the joys of such hours
could ever dream of forsaking his vocation, so
long as Fortune allowed him to retain his vision,
hearing, and the faculty for guiding an onrushing
ship through the realms of unlimited space—not
he for one, Perk assured himself, drawing in
huge draughts of the clear air, and watching the
wonderful beacons as they passed them by,
threading the pathway of the stars as it were,
straight toward their distant goal.</p>

<p class='c013'>The night wore on, with the voyagers making
splendid progress.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had made no miscalculation when saying
he believed they would fetch up at their destination
somewhere about the midnight hour; for
it still lacked more or less of that time when in
the near distance they glimpsed lights telling
that the city, and its nearby aviation field, must
be close at hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they found themselves circling over the
port, which, just as Jack had fancied would be
the case, was lighted most brilliantly. Even as
they sighted the field they noted a ship settling
down, evidently an air mail plane that had
been held up by some dense fog belt which they
had fortunately missed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Soft snap I’d call it, droppin’ down with all
them field lights to show the ground, so a feller
c’n see a rock the size o’ a baseball,” was what
the tickled Perk was telling himself while Jack
was proceeding to make the terminal drop, with
several ground attendants hurrying up so as to
lend any assistance needed.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had received his instructions from Jack,
and removed the handcuffs from the wrists of
the prisoner. There was no necessity for letting
everybody know the facts and the sight of a
man wearing steel bracelets, and gripped by an
attendant never fails to excite keen curiosity with
most people and especially would this be the
case if he had just come by the air route from
some unknown and therefore mysterious quarter.</p>

<p class='c013'>He would keep his arm through that of
Simeon, and inform him in a forcible whisper
that should he attempt any “funny business” it
would be at the risk of being shot down without
further warning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack would attend to everything necessary,
such as having their crate stowed away in some
convenient hangar, where it could be recovered
at any time, by paying such charges as were
customary.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be sure Perk was questioned by several of
the men while Jack saw that the ship was being
taken care of but when he chose, Perk could keep
a still tongue in his head and since he paid no
attention to what was said, and never opened his
mouth in the least, possibly they concluded he
must be both deaf and dumb.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk may have chuckled deep down in his
throat when he heard a few of the disgusted
remarks some of the men exchanged concerning
his lack of speech and hearing but
he kept his own counsel; and in the end Jack
came up saying he had secured a taxi to carry
them to a small hotel down in the heart of the
city, recommended by one of the hostlers who
seemed to know what he was talking about.</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon had looked a bit anxious, as though
wondering how their arrival at Los Angeles
would affect his wretched fortunes but he made
no attempt to appeal to the crowd for help.
Undoubtedly he was firmly convinced that the
grim Perk must be a man of his word, and that
any attempt on his part to break away would
prove a most serious matter indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah!” Perk was telling himself under his
breath when he took note of this humble disposition
on the part of Simeon, “Guess now he feels
it’s a heap better to be a live fool than a dead
hero; an’ by jinks I don’t blame the beggar for
thinkin’ thataways either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon all three safely lodged in the
taxi—which fortunately had remained up to this
late hour, the driver hoping to pick up a fare—and
heading for the nearby city.</p>

<p class='c013'>Later on they entered the small hotel, and
found it all the obliging ground attache at the
port had said. Jack registered the party, all of
them under fictitious names, since it paid to exercise
due caution when on the track of big game
just as it would for the big game hunter to make
no sound when advancing upon an enormous
tusker or “rogue” elephant whose spoor he had
been trailing through forest and jungle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Would it be possible for us to have some
supper sent up to our room?” Jack asked the
night clerk who shrugged his shoulders as if
dubious concerning his ability to accommodate
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kindly try to have it done, if double price
will have any effect,” continued Jack, using his
most gracious smile that usually accomplished
his purpose and at that the clerk responded by
saying he would do his best but it was of course
most unusual, and he hoped they would not make
any complaint if the variety was not all they
might wish.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quantity is the chief thing that interests
us,” said Jack; “you see, we have come
by air, and fell short of food while on our way,
so that my two pals here are very near being
starved; so whatever you send make it a fairly
bountiful spread, please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they were shown to their room, which
contained a double bed and a cot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I kinder guess now, partner,” said Perk, after
flashing a glance around the apartment, fronting
on a back lot, though up in the third story of the
building, “you an’ me better share the bed, while
Simeon gets his little nap on the sofy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That goes, Perk,” his comrade told him
“and after we’ve had supper we’ll hit the hay.
After such a broken night as we had back a ways
some sleep ought to be welcome, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! hope we don’t have to wait too tarnel
long for the grub,” Perk was saying, dismally
rubbing his stomach, as if to show how flat it
seemed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack engaged him in conversation of a general
character, just to keep his mind from dwelling
on the subject of eating for once Perk let himself
believe he was in danger of famishing and
he just could not subside but must commence
to marshal all the known dishes of which he was
especially fond, and keep on taunting and tantalizing
himself by stringing them off as might a
glib-tongued waiter in any restaurant.</p>

<p class='c013'>After quite a tiresome wait there was a knock
at the door, which Perk hastened to answer.
Two waiters strode in, bearing trays laden
with a pretty substantial assortment of food—quite
a satisfactory display, Jack thought, considering
the late hour, and that probably the regular
kitchen force must have long ago turned in
or else gone home.</p>

<p class='c013'>The table fairly groaned under the assortment—Perk
pertinently mentioned the fact,
adding that he guessed he’d do his share of
groaning <i>after</i> he had finished his supper which
Jack did not doubt in the least, having a knowledge
concerning the other’s vast appetite, and
unbridled disposition to make a pig of himself
at such times when food was plentiful.</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon Hawkins was coaxed to sit down with
them and as his state of mind seemed to have
improved quite a little, he also partook of food
of which he most certainly was much in need,
having fasted so long and abstemiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>When this ceremony had been carried through
to a finish, the supply of visible victuals had been
wonderfully reduced; and even Perk was heard
to declare he could not eat another bite, which
meant he was like a stuffed turkey, fit for the
Thanksgiving table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before turning in, Perk took occasion to “talk
like a Dutch uncle,” as he termed it, to Simeon,
assuring him he need not be in too upset a state
of mind concerning his future, since Jack had
said he was bound to do all he could to have him
let go, because of what he had confided to them,
and such assistance he would be able to lend the
Government in convicting the head men of the
lawless conspiracy along the counterfeiting line.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other nodded his head as though he
understood that, having embarked in the game
of throwing down Slippery Slim, he realized
there was nothing else for him to do but go
through to the windup.</p>

<p class='c013'>So confiding Perk, thinking things would run
smoothly, took off some of his outer garments,
and rolled into bed, as it afterwards turned out,
happily choosing that side of the same nearest
to the windows of their room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack soon followed, and the last thing he noticed
ere snapping off the light was the humbled
Simeon wrapped in a blanket, and lying there
flat on his back, as though meaning to get what
sleep he could during that fragment of the night
still remaining.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was, so far as appearances went, sound
asleep; but then sometimes things are not just
what they seem. To tell the truth, Perk had
made up his mind ere lying down that he would
“sleep with one eye open,” as he called it, meaning
it was his intention to keep on the alert, ready
to jump out of bed at the least sign of trouble.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps when he thus decided it was with a
hazy idea they might have some sort of unwelcome
visitor during the night; he could not just
decide how this could be but then those unprincipled
agents of the counterfeiter king—like
the fellow who had rifled the belongings of
Scotty, the air mail pilot in Atlanta—were liable
to turn up anywhere, everywhere, when least expected,
and try to manipulate their bold games.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hearing some sort of sound as of a person
moving, Perk suddenly sat straight up in bed,
to see their prisoner in the act of crawling over
the sill of the nearby window, evidently bent on
giving them the slip!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch25' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXV <br /> <br />THE STAGE SET FOR BATTLE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Hey! you, lay off that stuff!” was the way
Perk exploded, even as he made a wild dash
across the floor, and clutched the reckless Simeon
by the arm, dragging him back into the room
by sheer strength.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other struggled but feebly perhaps he
was really horrified at the desperate chances he
had been about to take.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, you must be goofy, Hawkins, to try that
sort o’ game!” Perk went on scornfully,
as the wretched man writhed on the floor where
he had flung him. “Don’t you know it’s two
stories down to the roof o’ that extension; an’
chances are you’d a got a broken neck, or leg,
in the drop. Better make up your mind to take
the medicine an’ stand it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack of course had been aroused at the first
movement of his chum, and sat up in bed watching
the actions of the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Trying to take leg bail, was he, Perk?” he
remarked. “You can hardly blame the poor
dick, come to think of it because he’s rubbing
up against a tough proposition. Better put the
bracelets on him again, and tie his ankles together
he might get loco, and try to jump out
of a window, just to end it all and that would
be too bad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon, utterly cowed and silent, made no resistance
when Perk followed out his pal’s advice.
There were several hours of the night still remaining,
and they might as well secure such
sleep as lay in their power, since no one could
predict what sort of strenuous activity awaited
them in the near future.</p>

<p class='c013'>Came morning, and the two air detectives
were stirring.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another right fine mornin’ for us,” Perk remarked,
blithely, as he looked out of the window,
and made a grimace at seeing what a nasty
drop had awaited the desperate prisoner had he
succeeded in carrying out his plan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! that’s the usual program, I understand,
out here on the Coast,” Jack told him. “Hardly
ever see any rain in this blessed country; that’s
why they have to depend on irrigation for their
crops.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Plenty to keep us hoppin’ today, I kinder
guess, partner, eh, what?” volunteered Perk, as
he started dressing, after removing the stout
cords that had been wrapped about the lower
limbs of the Federal prisoner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never said truer words, boy,” Jack
added “got to settle about this business of having
our friend here held until the gate’s been
crashed, and our scoop put through. Then I
mean to have a good talk with several people in
the Government offices, who can give us a few
points that so far we’ve been missing. You can’t
pick up too much information when aiming to
stack up against smart lads like this Slippery
Slim. He’s got so many eyes on the watch the
chap who expects to corral <i>him</i> must get up right
early in the morning, and pull the wires in a
dozen different directions. I’d a heap rather
overdo the matter of taking precautions than to
let just one ragged end get loose, for a game like
this is only as strong as its weakest link.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do we eat here, or look up a restaurant?”
asked Perk, quite naturally, since it was the
easiest thing in the world for his thoughts to
turn toward the subject of catering to the loud
demands of his stomach, when the usual time
for meals came around.</p>

<p class='c013'>“On the whole I reckon it’d be as well for us
to stick around, and have breakfast fetched up
here,” suggested jack. “I’ll step down presently,
and see if it can be managed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just as you say, partner,” Perk told him,
grinning, to add: “Make her two fried eggs and
a rasher o’ bacon for me; also a big cup o’ coffee
with a stack o’ wheats done brown. Say, you
might add some toast, and an orange, seein’ that
this is California, an’ a feller ought to patronize
the fruit industry when happenin’ to visit the
Coast country. Guess that ought to fill a vacuum
okay, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Leave it to me, Perk, and you’ll never starve
to death I’m a good provider, and Uncle Sam
foots the chuck wagon bill.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When later on two waiters appeared laden
down with a mass of dishes, Perk grinned some
more, and looked quite joyous; for the odor of
coffee and bacon always pleased his sense of smell
as nothing else could.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Simeon had apparently about decided to
make the best of a bad bargain, for he began
sniffing as though the idea of breakfast appealed
to him—he certainly needed something to brace
him up.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along about ten o’clock they prepared to set
out for the offices of the Federal forces in Los
Angeles. Simeon had finally given his word not
to make any further attempt at escape. Jack had
been talking seriously with the fellow ever since
breakfast, trying to squeeze further information
from him, and holding out hope that if he “came
clean” he might yet be allowed to go back to his
family after the Government had made use of
him to send the leaders in the wide flung conspiracy
to prison for long terms.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again a convenient taxi was called upon to
convey the trio to their intended destination.
Both Jack and Perk evinced considerable curiosity
concerning the unfamiliar sights on the
streets. They asked numerous questions of the
driver, who chanced to be a communicative sort
of fellow, and filled them up with information
about the sunny queen city of the Coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not long before Jack’s magical passport,
sanctioned by the Big Boss at Washington,
brought them in contact with several high officials
who apparently had been secretly apprized
of their presence in the West, and had
also been requested to afford the two daring sky
detectives all the assistance possible in carrying
out their plan of campaign.</p>

<p class='c013'>So it came about that Simeon was taken off
their hands, after the story of his capture had
been told. Jack secured a promise that the man
would be lightly dealt with because of the valuable
aid he had already afforded the sleuth-hounds
of the air branch of the Law.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both of them shook hands with the pitiful
looking chap as he was taken away by a marshal
who had been summoned and who would see
that he was kept aloof from all other prisoners
until his testimony was wanted in court.</p>

<p class='c013'>After that they fell into a general talk, Jack
telling the deeply interested officials about the
stirring adventures befalling himself and Perk
since they first struck Atlanta, where the drive
really had its beginning.</p>

<p class='c013'>In return he was given such information as
had been gathered in connection with more recent
happenings along the line of Slippery Slim’s
operations and the fact of the matter was there
always seemed to be fresh outbreaks of the bogus
money disease in this or that part of the whole
Southwest, as new agents started to work virgin
territory until by this time the greatest unrest
and uneasiness existed among all Government
ranks.</p>

<p class='c013'>The balance of that day the two pals put in
taking a look around the city, visiting Hollywood,
and seeing a number of movie stars whom
they recognized from familiarity with their faces
on the silver screen at various times.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack paid another visit to Federal Headquarters
on the succeeding day, to gather up all
loose ends, and decide on his plans while Perk
took himself off to look up some old friend, who,
he understood, was making good in one of the
new big pictures.</p>

<p class='c013'>They met again late in the afternoon, with
Perk displaying signs of nervous tension for
almost the first thing he said to his chum was in
the shape of a leading question, which Jack undoubtedly
anticipated, knowing Perk’s headlong
nature as he did, and the habit of the other for
seeking speedy action.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wal, what’s the good word, old hoss—when
do we skip out from here, if so be it’s all set?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No more hanging fire, brother,” Jack assured
him, smilingly “we’re loaded for bear this time,
sure pop. I’ve been out at the airport, and had
a full tank of gas put aboard the crate as well
as all that stuff you sent over so’s to keep us from,
starving to death.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bully boy!” crowed the delighted Perk; “jest
can’t come any too soon to please me. I’m only
cravin’ a chanct for a set-to with the head o’ this
flim-flam bunch, who’s laughed at the Government
boys just once too often. Is it tonight,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Midnight ought to see us several hundred
miles on our way, if all goes well,” Jack told
him, not displaying any outward signs of jubilation
himself, although he undoubtedly must be
thrilled by the thought of how they were now
about to put everything to the test, and match
their wits against that astute schemer, for whom
the Federal prison doors were yawning so widely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never gimme sweeter words, old pal!”
Perk was saying, backed up by one of his most
hideous grins.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch26' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVI <br /> <br />ON THE FACE OF THE MOON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Jack proved as good as his word, for they were
off shortly after nightfall, and headed almost
due east. No one at the aviation field had the
remotest idea as to who they were, what their
destination might be, and whence they came.
But then this particular port was becoming a
very important link in the trans-continental
chain, with lines of great passenger and freight
airships going and coming not to mention the
several speedy air mail boats that covered their
hundreds of miles day or night and as a rule on a
schedule that seemed as perfect as that of any
train time table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was unusually silent, at least for him.
Perhaps he was realizing at last the serious
nature of the job they had undertaken—that it
was rather a weighty proposition, such as was
bound to require all their united reserve force
to put across.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still, he had absolute confidence in Jack’s
ability to swing the undertaking, and also refused
to allow anything like doubt to assail him
with regard to their united courage.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was by this time well understood that the
climax, when it came, would occur on Mexican
soil for now that all accounts from every quarter
were in hand, they knew absolutely that the den
of the counterfeiting gang was in a secret cave
among the mountains of Sonora also that the
sagacious Slim had bought protection from certain
local Mexican officials, who were suspected
of secretly plotting a new revolution, and took
this means for obtaining the money needed to
purchase arms in the States.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was even said that Slim never flew back to
his headquarters without loading his swift plane
with a dead weight of guns and ammunition as
the price he had to pay for being allowed to operate
undisturbed on foreign soil.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A pretty kettle of fish, I’d call that sort o’
game,” Perk had indignantly asserted, when he
learned of this see-saw method of currying favor
with the plotting generals who hoped to once
again turn the country upside-down and kick
the present rulers out of office, as well as seize
the city banks with their rich booty.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so it was, but Jack realized how it accounted
for the long spell of immunity Slim had
enjoyed while he lined his pockets, and spread
that financial panic throughout the Southwestern
States. There never had been his equal as a skillful
worker and bold lawbreaker; one who knew
how to set neighbor against neighbor, and make
every one work so that he could rake off a heavy
dividend from each separate deal.</p>

<p class='c013'>So he had for a long time been coming and
going, crossing the border, as a rule by the air
route, carrying his cargoes of deceitful bank bills
to various distributing points—like the one Jack
and Perk had struck by sheer accident—gathering
the genuine stuff contributed by his numerous
dupes, and leaving bulky packages of the wonderfully
executed spurious notes in exchange.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a veritable Golconda for the industrious
worker, who, safe from interference, had kept
as busy as the proverbial bee, that stores honey
day after day.</p>

<p class='c013'>They followed the line of swirling beacons
the air mail boys were in the habit of trailing,
since by this means they could pass some of the
numerous danger spots on their route. In good
time Jack expected to turn his back on these
friendly flashing lights and head due south, to
cross the border, and fly over foreign territory.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had been placed in possession of certain
secret documents issued by the Mexican government,
which proved how they knew of the unholy
alliance made between Slim, the counterfeiter
king, and those traitorous generals who yearned
for fresh outbreaks so as to pamper their own
personal fortunes, just then at low ebb.</p>

<p class='c013'>There existed something of an arrangement,
whereby the Mexican government agreed to
stand back of any effort made by the Department
at Washington to capture Slim, smash his gang
that was widening its powers every day, and
clean out the mess of near-bandits with whom he
had allied himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>If it were necessary all arrangements had been
made whereby Colonel Jose Morales, with a
crack regiment of hard fighting regulars who
had seen much bloody service in bringing the
defiant Yaqui Indians to terms by invading their
mountain fastnesses, and meeting them hand-to-hand—was
stationed within a day’s ride of the
ravine where Slim had his plant and could be
summoned by means of certain smoke signals.
No sooner would these “talking smokes” be detected
than the order would be given “boots and
saddles,” with the mounted regiment in full
swing for the debatable ground where Slim had
his nefarious nest.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, too, had a secret arrangement been effected
with the old leader of the now defunct Texas
Rangers, most of whom were in the service of the
Government connected with the border patrol
and orders had been given the former gallant
hero that if a certain message were received, no
matter by what method, he was to gather a squad
of his old fighters, and cross the border, sure of
being warmly received by the loyal Mexican
troops who would welcome his assistance in wiping
out the sore spot that had been so long a blot
on their country’s honor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus it would seem that everything possible
had been done toward striking a telling blow.
It only remained for Jack Ralston to start the
ball rolling, when it must gain fresh impetus
with every revolution.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk acted as though decidedly pleased when
later on he discovered that they no longer followed
the flashing beacon trail—Jack had gone
as far as was judicious along that line and now
headed straight into the mysterious south, toward
the border of the neighboring republic where
disorder still held sway, and disgruntled chiefs
continued to plot against the rule of the recently
elected president.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every mile traversed now was bringing them
closer to their goal, and Perk found more or less
joy in picturing the thrilling climax, when they
would give Slippery Slim the surprise of his
life—if only no leak concerning their clever plan
had come about.</p>

<p class='c013'>The moon had risen, and was hanging there
in the east, a silvery shield with one edge clipped
off telling that the queen of the night was already
well past her “full” stage and running for
a fall.</p>

<p class='c013'>All at once Perk had an electric shock.</p>

<p class='c013'>He leaned convulsively forward and gripped
his mate by the shoulder, at the same time pointing
toward the southeast and shouting through
the head phones:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look, oh look—see what’s passing across the
moon, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then just as suddenly did he release his clutch,
to fall back in his seat, and exclaim most dramatically,
with a touch of disgust in his voice:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! It’s slipped past, dang the luck!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But I got it all right, Perk,” the pilot assured
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it <i>was</i> a ship, an’ my lamps didn’t fool
me, partner?” Perk cried in renewed excitement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As sure as you’re born, that’s what it was,
brother,” Jack added.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Headin’ south, same as we’re doin’ right now,
eh, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, buddy—just what the crate was
doing, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the answer—could it a been <i>him</i>, on
his way back home with a load o’ machine guns,
life they say he carries every time he crosses the
border, after takin’ out a freshly printed batch
o’ his flimsy stuff to soak on the honest folks back
home?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s something we can only make a stab
at,” replied Jack. “Chances lean that, way, I
must say; but just the same it might have been
some mail plane that’s got blown off its regular
course, and is beating it for the home port. Then
again I understand the border patrol are handling
a few ships in their line of intercepting flyers
making a business of smuggling Chinese aliens
across the line night-times.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d give a heap to know the answer to that
puzzle,” continued Perk, who disliked enigmas,
and all that sort of thing calculated to make a
fellow lie awake nights, bothering his poor
brains. He never had been fitted by Nature for
the job of being a real detective.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll never know,” his pal told him, “unless
it happens we run afoul of the other crate when
our courses draw closer together and if it’s Slim
whose fingers grip that stick we’d rather be excused
for having that happen—our job is to fetch
him back <i>alive</i>, and not make him lose his life
in a crash.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me, I ain’t peticular just what <i>does</i> happen
to the slick guy,” Perk wound up the little talkfest
by saying. “Only, when it comes to a real
showdown either Slim or us got to go to the
wall—dead or alive, the thing’s goin’ to be settled
for keeps!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch27' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVII <br /> <br />THE SIERRA MADRE CHAIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Another thing Perk noticed—this was the fact
that Jack seemed to have changed his mind with
regard to making haste for the ship was racing
along at top-notch speed, as though engaged
in a race with some unseen rival.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hey! what’s the big idea, Jack?” he called
out, when this thing had been going on for some
time, and his burning curiosity could no longer
be held in leash. “Why doin’ the sprintin’ act,
I’m awonderin’?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Less chance for us to run foul of that other
boat if we forge well ahead, don’t you see, partner?”
exclaimed the pilot, sententiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! that’s a fact,” returned the enlightened
Perk. “An’ then mebbe it’d be jest as well for us
to get there ahead o’ the boss in the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m aiming to do that,” he was told.
“It happens that we can’t keep on in the boat till
we strike close to his hideout—the racket would
stir the whole bunch up like a hornet’s nest you’ve
kicked when going through the brush, with the
mad critters swarming out to tackle you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you now, Big Boss—never did think
o’ that before. Then I kinder guess we’ll
have to hike some little way,” and there was a
vein of chagrin in the speaker’s voice as he mentioned
this fact, since walking and Perk never
did seem to agree very well—like most flyers he
had been spoiled for all manner of pedestrianism
by his ability to cover such vast distances
without moving his pedal extremities an iota.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s our sure enough program,” Jack told
him, doubtless thinking that the delayed knowledge
might allow his pal to make up his mind
about swallowing the bitter medicine without a
single grimace.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not long after this little break when
Jack again spoke:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve a good idea we’re across the line now,
partner,” was the information he passed along.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sounds good to me, okay,” commented Perk,
with a tinge of solid satisfaction visible in his
voice as though having a possible rough-house
job to handle, the sooner he got busy the sooner
it was likely to be over.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And making more than an even hundred
miles to the hour in the bargain, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some punkins about comin’ in swell on the
last lap, this crate sure is, I’d say, partner.
Licketty split she humps along like a reg’lar
witch. I guess now she’d make rings around
that ol’ boat Slim’s got hold o’ though it
answers his purpose seems like. But see here,
Jack, you never did tell me jest how you got word
to that same Colonel Morales down here in
Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was given my instructions, and sent a telegram
to him at Hermosilla, in care of Padre
Lopez, giving him the order he was expecting—during
the last hour we were in Los Angeles.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! then the sojers must be in the saddle
right now!” burst out Perk, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If the arrangement went through without a
miss that’s like enough a fact,” admitted Jack;
“the way my plan’s arranged everything must go
off with the regularity of machine work, each
separate part dovetailing, so as to work in full
sympathy. If anything lags, and goes amiss, it’s
apt to throw the whole scheme out of gear, you
understand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! I grab what you mean, partner,” said
the astounded Perk; “but I got to hand it to you
when it comes to hatchin’ up big things—it’s jest
wonderful how you manage. An’ I sure do hope
everything’ll slide along like greased lightnin’,
once it gets started.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had planned to drop down in some isolated
spot where with the coming of dawn, with
the aid of the strong glasses they could pick up
the rocky Sierra Madre range with its canyons
and valleys, where, unless all his leads have been
false clues, those whom they sought would have
their secret den and stronghold.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk got to thinking these matters over, and of
course he was bound to run across some things
that still seemed a bit hazy in his mind. Accordingly
he sought for information at headquarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, now, d’ye know I’m jest beginnin’ to get
on to why you had the wings an’ fuselage o’ this
here ship painted the color o’ sand—took a pattern
from the way they striped the steamers on
the Atlantic durin’ the big war, an’ colored batteries
on the battle front, so flyers couldn’t pick
’em out to drop their bombs down on—camouflage,
ain’t that the right word, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Slow to get on to my little schemes, partner;
but in the end you make a smart stab—yes, that
was what I had in mind, for I knew we’d have
to park the old bus somewhere in the open; and
I didn’t want any hostile eye to glimpse her from
a soaring plane, or a mountain crag—for you see
I reckoned Slim was too smart a lad not to have
binoculars handy so as to watch for trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>More than ever was Perk impressed with an
overwhelming admiration for the ability of his
pal to lay plans capable of covering every possible
necessity that could arise in carrying out
the job they had tackled.</p>

<p class='c013'>He asked no more questions, confident that
everything was bound to move along smoothly,
when the casting of the play was in such capable
hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Anyway,” he told himself as he thus pondered,
“we ain’t seen anything more o’ that moon
ship, which makes it certain we’ve knocked her
outen the runnin’. Wonder now if that was really
an’ truly ol’ Slim, totin’ a swell bunch o’ machine
guns, so’s to bolster up the new revolution
they say is bein’ fostered an’ nursed in this corner
o’ poor ol’ Mexico. Queer what international
jingles a feller c’n get mixed up in, when he runs
in harness with Uncle Sam’s revenue boys; but
it’s all pie to me, just the same, ’cause they allers
did say my middle name was Scrap.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was now starting to make use of the binoculars,
which were fitted with lens capable of
making them useful during the night-time, at
least when there was a certain amount of moonlight.
In a general way Perk could decide where
to turn his attention, for it went without saying
that the mountain chain lay toward the southeast
for had he not studied the lay of the land
upon the small but accurate map with which
Jack had armed himself before leaving Washington
to take up this hazardous adventure?</p>

<p class='c013'>When he felt assured that he could make out
the distant ridges he announced his pleasing discovery
to his mate and then at the other’s request
took over the controls so that Jack in turn might
use the glasses and thus make assurance doubly
safe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bank, and head more into the east,” Perk
heard the other saying, after a steady look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it’s the Sierra Madre okay, partner, I
opine?” suggested the one at the stick, as he
obeyed orders.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question about it,” Jack assured him “but
I knew it was time for us to sight the ridge. I’ve
pored over the map of this section, and charted
it all out in blocks, so I can tell just what the lay
of the land is, and how long it’s apt to take the
colonel to get here with his galloping company.
We’re going to drop down presently, and find
shelter where we can lie low until the hour comes
for making our ten strike.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How long might that be, boss?” asked Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It all depends on certain happenings. We
can creep up close to the place, and watch how
things move figuring out how to act when you
get your first glimpse of a dust cloud away off
toward where Hermosilla lies. I give the cavalry
two days to reach here, if everything moves along
smoothly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Two long days—an’ say, we gotter eat all that
time, don’t we, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We surely can’t live on air, Perk; but I’ve
provided for that—even should we run out of
grub you laid in I’ve a little deposit of dried
meat, real pemmican in fact, that will keep us
from famishing. Water we can secure somewhere
among the mountain trails, since never a
drop would we be apt to find on the open desert.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! I’m leavin’ it all to you, Big Boss,”
Perk told him, again lost in wonder and near
awe as he realized how Jack seemed to have
thought of everything—what a mind the boy had
for grasping details, and weaving them into the
net with which they expected to enmesh the slippery
one.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now Jack slowed down their speed more or
less, although of course it was not possible to
soften the clamor accompanying their flight
through space. But Perk noticed that, so far as
he could tell, the night wind was coming from
ahead, and this assured him it would not be apt
to carry those telltale sounds toward the range
lying in the east, and so warn the enemy of their
coming.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch28' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVIII <br /> <br />CLOSE TO THE TIGER’S LAIR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“We’re about due for a landing, Perk,” finally
announced the pilot, after he had used the glasses
for a spell, and again took over the stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! some hike that’s agoin’ to be, I’d say,
old hoss,” grunted Perk; “but I guess it can’t
be helped—got to take the bitter with the sweet
lots o’ times—the way o’ the world, seems like.
Go to it then, boss; if anybody c’n make a safe
landin’ by moonlight it’s jest you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>His confidence was not misplaced, as Jack
proved when he brought the ship down in as
perfect a three-point drop as the best of aces
could have carried out.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’ll have to lie here till we need her again,”
he observed, on climbing out of his confined
quarters, and stretching his cramped legs after
the manner of air mail pilots in from a long and
irksome run.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk stared around him—they were on the
sandy desert without a doubt, and off toward the
east could be seen the dim crests of the high and
ragged peaks comprising the main ridges of the
Sierra Madres—old-time home of the fierce
Yaqui Indians, whom the soldiers of Mexico had
for so many years labored so hard and in vain
to conquer; nor was it until the day the airplane
came along that they were able to accomplish
this much to be desired end.</p>

<p class='c013'>But now other equally annoying thorns in the
flesh had made a hideout of those same
inaccessible mountains—defeated aspirants for
the presidency of the Republic, always generals,
took to gathering groups of malcontents and mercenary
adventurers in these mountain depths,
defying the troops sent to rout them out, and
proving the latest source of trouble in the political
problems of the authorities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack soon completed his preparations for
abandoning their ship. He looked it all over, to
satisfy himself its camouflage would prevent it
from being sighted by any air pilot chancing to
pass overhead at a reasonable altitude then he
gathered a few articles, the possession of which
might turn out to be of value when it came to
closing the mouth of the bag and finally announced
himself as ready to make a move.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got all you wanted, Perk?” he inquired, incidentally,
for he had reason to feel certain such
was the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! from the binoculars an’ my rifle, down
to what’s left o’ the eats,” the other assured him.
“Guess we’ll get along somehow or other.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! don’t bother your head about the grub
part, comrade; I’m carrying a small packet with
me that holds enough to keep two men alive for
a whole week—all we’ll have to do is to run
across some sort of spring, where we can get all
the drinking water we’ll need, while we wait for
the wagon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! in this case you’re meanin’ a <i>hearse</i>,
’cause mebbe we’ll have to shoot him up afore he
calls quits,” and Perk grinned horribly at his
own wit.</p>

<p class='c013'>So they left the ship stranded there, sprawled
out like a gigantic dragon-fly or a monstrous
toad. If Fortune proved kind they might yet
live to make good use of it again when the time
came to fly back to God’s country on the other
side of the border where defeated candidates
are in the habit of accepting the dictum of the
voters, and retiring from the field of battle await
the next call to arms, with ballots instead of
bullets as their method of settling elections.</p>

<p class='c013'>Side by side they set forth, like a pair of adventurers
starting out in search of Fortune’s
smiles, and careless alike as to whether they met
with success or not, so long as the excitement
they craved came their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk managed to conceal the chagrin with
which he buckled down to his unwelcome task,
walking always gave him a pain, mental rather
than physical but on the whole he was a good
scout, and could follow the beckoning finger of
duty, even though he loathed the conditions attached
to the performance of his role.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sand was far from compact, and allowed
them to sink in somewhat, so this made the going
more difficult in contrast to that on the seashore
which being beaten down by incoming waves is
often as hard as concrete and a pleasure to walk
over; whereas this of the desert was dry and
sifted at the least puff of wind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk having had some previous experience
with deserts, felt no love for the uninviting waste
places of the earth only such useless vegetation
as sage, greasewood, cactus and yucca would
grow between the sand dunes amidst the blistering
fangs of the infernal heat and always vowed
he disliked such arid regions with a violence too
deep for mere words.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet he kept his own counsel and plodded away
alongside his pal as if he had no personal feelings
in the matter whatsoever. Far off in front
of them they could see the line of peaks studded
against the sky once or twice Perk felt certain
he had caught a fluttering light aloft such as
might spring from a passing plane but in every
instance he finally decided it must be some shooting
star, ducking behind the mountain range,
leaving a trailing wake behind that but reflected
its passing glory.</p>

<p class='c013'>One hour, two, and then a third dragged along
before Jack thought fit to call a halt. Never did
poor weary footsore Perk, almost used up, listen
to more welcome and delightful words than
when Jack as he drew to a halt went on to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Time to rest, partner, you know—I’d like to
find a bunch of shady trees that would afford us
a decent shelter from the blazing sun, should we
be so unfortunate as to get adrift after leaving
all landmarks behind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! bless you for sayin’ that, buddy,” Perk
was saying hoarsely, for his throat seemed as dry
as tinder, the fine sand even affecting his vocal
cords so that he would not have recognized his
own voice. “By your leave I guess I’ll lie down
and get the kinks outen my legs. Wow! that
must abeen fi’ miles if she was one—my shoes
are full o’ sand, an’ altogether I don’t feel half
the man I was on startin’ out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There are some trees over yonder, you may
notice, Perk; so after we’ve caught our second
wind we’ll take chances, and cut across to where
they lie, perhaps when morning comes tripping
along, we may climb up the face of the mountain
and get a look-in at the printing establishment
that’s set itself up in opposition to the U. S.
Treasury Department, and the Federal Bank.
Come on then, a little further where we can drop
down, and rest our weary feet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards the pair had crept in
among the sheltering trees, where Jack called a
rest, although under the impression that they
should get along further before break of day.</p>

<p class='c013'>He talked matters over with his partner, speaking
almost in whispers, since in this enemy country
no one could take anything for granted and
for all they knew hostile ears might chance to
be close by, ready to listen in.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Perk himself who proposed to move
along while the going was good.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like we might be a heap better off, old
hoss, if on’y we located up thar on the side o’ the
mountain, where we could see without our bein’
watched. I’m okay now, an’ ready for b’ar.”</p>

<p class='c013'>That was the spirit Jack liked in his mate—a
readiness to take hold and reach a decision. They
moved along toward the base of the forbidding
height, keeping a watchful eye on the eastern
sky lest dawn come and surprise them in the
open, where it would not be easy to find a hiding
place during the entire day.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fortune favored them, for they managed to
get under cover before the first gray streaks appeared
in the east. It was bound to be a strenuous
task climbing that formidable mountain side
but Jack had prepared for even this part of the
adventure.</p>

<p class='c013'>From various sources he had learned how there
were three separate means for subduing that
grim pyramid of rocks and trees and tangled
growth—in order to lessen the chances of discovery,
with unpleasant consequences, Jack had
decided to try and negotiate the most difficult
of these mountain trails in the belief that it
would offer a safer passage since evidently none
of the seething revolutionists, or their allies, the
bad men from across the border, would be likely
to follow that canyon trail when others less difficult
could be utilized.</p>

<p class='c013'>Down there hidden by the bushes and spurs
of outlying rock they employed their time in
munching what must serve as their breakfast.
Then quenching their thirst at a convenient
pool they proceeded to climb the face of
the steep elevation, making for the quaint hollow
in the crater of a long dead volcano and which
had once been a Yaqui fort.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch29' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIX <br /> <br />NEARING THE GOAL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>They had now reached that most thrilling
point in their bold venture, where they would
have to “watch their steps” most carefully, lest
an incautious act precipitate a calamity that must
end all their hopes as well as snuff out their
lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>This breeding place for inflammatory embers
of Mexican revolutionary disappointed political
generals, and their immediate retainers, was
about as safe for the two sky detectives as a cage
of Bengal tigers would have been once let their
presence be suspected, and the entire neighborhood
would be scratched over as with a fine-tooth
comb in the endeavor to discover their
hiding place and should they be rounded up it
needed no magician to prophesy what their fate
must be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack led the way, with Perk following at his
heels, every sense on the alert. The native cougar
of that historical group of mountains could
hardly have crept along with greater care than
did the two human sleuth hounds of the law.
Every advance was attempted only after a careful
survey of the entire neighborhood—at the
sound of some faint bird-call Jack would sink
down and flatten himself upon the ground, his
example being imitated by his shadow.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this caused their progress to be exceedingly
slow but time did not enter into their calculations
so much as security—many hours must
pass ere Jack could figure on the arrival of those
upon whom everything depended and they
might as well make use of the entire morning in
climbing higher and higher toward their ultimate
goal.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once when they chanced to be resting their
tired limbs, snug in a sheltered nook behind a
mass of brushwood, Jack turned and looked back.
The site was especially fine for looking out on
the level stretch toward the spot where they had
landed during the preceding night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, watching the actions of his comrade,
could easily give a close guess as to what Jack
had in mind. This opinion was made more convincing
when he saw the other get out the useful
binoculars, and apply them to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Keenly he kept tabs on the others and was
finally thrilled to note the pleased nod Jack gave
as if wholly satisfied.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk touched him on the arm, and as Jack
turned made motions with his head, while his
eyebrows went up, his expression without a single
word being spoken signifying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How come?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take a look for yourself, and tell me if you
can get the first glimpse of our old crate” suggested
Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ doin,” whispered Perk, after a most
diligent search; “an’ if we can’t get a whiff o’
the boat, with these glasses, I kinder guess
nobody ain’t agoin’ to locate it with their naked
eyes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which same lets us out from any danger in
that quarter,” came softly from Jack, whose face
for the moment lost some of the strained look it
had borne during the last few hours.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never saw a better sample o’ camouflage
when I was across the big pond alistenin’ to the
smash o’ the rip-roarin’ German guns,” asserted
Perk; and then “dried up” when he saw the
other press a finger on his lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>Higher they climbed, like monkeys, taking all
manner of desperate chances when necessity
arose but so cautious was Jack in leading the
way that nothing amiss came about, every obstacle
being successfully surmounted until
shortly before the noon hour they found themselves
in a position to spy upon the camp of their
intended prey.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was intensely interested in what he now
visioned. The old crater, resembling an immense
football bowl, as adopted by some Eastern
colleges, looked as though it might have proven
well nigh impregnable as a fortress where the
fighting Yaquis were able to hold an army at
bay—which feat history records as an actual fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>Scattered about the depression were scores of
rude dwellings, some built of rocks, while others
more modern had walls composed of sun-baked
bricks, known throughout all Mexico as <i>adobes</i>.
Men and women, also children, could be seen
moving about, preparing the noonday meal or
partaking of their customary frijoles, hot tamales,
or it might be maize cakes cooked in the
hot ashes of fires, and with black coffee as a
beverage.</p>

<p class='c013'>The picture appealed to Perk, who delighted
in novel scenes nor did it seem to lose any of
its thrill from the fact that, as he very well knew,
the men he was staring at so eagerly were most
likely as tough a brand of desperadoes and villains
as could be grouped together anywhere on
earth—ready to fight, hold up trains, or commit
all manner of pillage at the drop of a hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>He marveled at the sagacity shown by Slippery
Slim in deciding to join forces with these
firebrands of the back country, with the idea of
thus securing the greatest safety for his own
lawless operations.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this while Jack had been keeping close
watch, in hopes of being able to pick out the
figure of the man he had been deputized to bring
back to the States so he might be prosecuted for
his crimes, and sent to Atlanta. There he would
possibly end his days in seclusion, with a large
portion of the Southwest breathing more freely
since they need no longer fear the avalanche of
counterfeit currency that had been demoralizing
business for such a long spell.</p>

<p class='c013'>After all it was Perk who made the discovery,
he chancing to be carefully handling the binoculars
at the time. He handed the glasses over to
his mate, and told Jack just where to look, using
as few words as possible, and keeping his voice
very low.</p>

<p class='c013'>Long and earnestly did Jack follow the movements
of the remarkable character who had been
described in his hearing so many times. What
satisfaction it afforded him to know he was actually
in sight of the big game and if only his
plans carried through his hour of triumph was
steadily drawing closer and closer. In imagination,
as he continued to watch the moving figure,
he could vision the pleasure it would afford him
when he could turn in his report to his Chief,
and mark it as completed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon drifted along, and night approached.
Nothing could be done to hasten the
crisis; they must wait patiently, and continue to
shape their plans until the expected smoke signal
told them Morales and his rough riders had
reached the foot of the Sierra Madres ten miles
further south and when assured by means of a
counter signal that everything was working well,
start to cover the last lap of their long ride, leave
their mounts at a safe distance, and complete the
journey on foot.</p>

<p class='c013'>When darkness fell the picture was even more
fascinating to Perk than before, with a number
of fires lighting up the huge bowl, the sound of
women chattering in Spanish, and children playing
just as all youngsters might do while from
time to time he could catch strains of music, telling
that some amorous swain might be practicing
on his guitar, as all who have a drop of Spanish
blood in their veins invariably love to do when
at leisure.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk doubtless made many a grimace while
partaking of the light refreshment afforded by
the tough pemmican Jack had produced, as their
sole means for staying their empty stomachs for
when the evening breeze wafted some of the
odors from the cooking fires down below it almost
set him wild with a desire to partake of hot
food. But he knew what he was up against, and
sternly repressed the inclination to groan his
protest.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was one of the longest nights Perk ever
knew. The mountain air, too, was cold, especially
along toward the last few hours and since
they were debarred from the joy of indulging
in a campfire, Perk could only lie there and
shiver. He never was so glad to see the pink
sky in the east as on that occasion.</p>

<p class='c013'>The day was but a repetition of their former
afternoon with their sole recreation being the
chance it gave them to watch Slippery Slim’s
movements whenever he appeared coming out of
what seemed to be a cavern of some sort from
which at several times when the racket from many
tongues died down Perk could catch a strange
rumbling sound, accompanied by what seemed
to be a blow, and which he could easily believe
must be the working of the printing press that
had been carried all the way from the States in
order to be able to produce those wonderfully
clever notes that had deceived many shrewd
bank tellers by their deceptive qualities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then at last Jack discovered, just as night had
begun to fall, three columns of smoke rising toward
the heavens from far down the wild Sierra,
telling how that Morales and his troop had arrived,
and that the curtain was about to rise on
the last scene of the international drama.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch30' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXX <br /> <br />JACK GETS HIS MAN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Immediately on discovering the welcome signal,
Jack dispatched Perk to put a match to the
heap of brush they had arranged well out of sight
from the depression where the skeleton revolutionary
army was slowly assembling its pitiful
force of the dissatisfied generals who had been
counted out in the last national election.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk understood what was expected of him,
and managed to send up a single smoke signal,
allowing it to have but a brief life and then hastening
to smother the fire. As Morales was expected
to be on the watch for just such a sign,
he would lose little time in starting to carry out
his part in the attack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In three hours they will be climbing the
mountain by way of the old Yaqui trail we followed,”
Jack was telling his chum, when the
other returned to his side, flushed with the success
of his labors. “It is time for us to make a
forward move, so that we may be ready to strike
as soon as the camp quiets down and corral our
man, leaving it to Morales to carry the fort itself
by storm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This they set about doing without any further
delay. Dodging from rock to rock, taking advantage
of every outlying spur, as well as patches
of hardy bushes, and other objects that were
likely to conceal their movements from any
watchful eyes but always creeping downward,
they crawled along like two great lizards such,
as Perk could remember seeing when in the
Philippines.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the time they were ready to slip into the
underground pressroom of the lawless printing
company’s plant, Jack figured the three hours
had just about expired, and that it was now up to
them to make the first hostile move that would
precipitate the assault.</p>

<p class='c013'>In thus deciding to make a start he was influenced
by seeing an agreed upon signal from
the same hiding place he and Perk had held for
so many hours, and which told him the troopers
had finally succeeded in climbing to the position
assigned to them when plans for action were
formed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Flattening themselves out against the dark
wall of a small cliff Jack and Perk glided along
until they arrived at that aperture in the solid
rock they knew to be the entrance to the wonderful
underground retreat that had been described
by Simeon at the time when in his desperation
he gave his confederates away and from which
they had watched Slippery Slim come and go
during those long hours of their espionage.</p>

<p class='c013'>Slipping inside, they found themselves in a
corridor that led into the body of the mountain
with a gleam of light beckoning them to advance.
In this fashion they kept moving, gliding from
one point to another, until eventually they had a
clear view of the little machine that was working
so industriously in turning out the bogus
money, hour after hour, as though the demand
were without limit.</p>

<p class='c013'>How Perk did stare, and hold his breath when
realizing that they were upon the verge of accomplishing
their great undertaking. Slippery
Slim was doing no actual manual labor himself,
but he kept close watch over the two men who
ran the press, closely scrutinizing the printed
bills as if to detect the slightest inaccuracy, and
correct it without delay.</p>

<p class='c013'>No wonder, Jack told himself, the product of
his skill had startled the financial world by its
genuine appearance, when such a master in his
particular line took such personal pains to see
that the work was carried out in its most minute
details.</p>

<p class='c013'>In whispers Jack informed his backer what his
duty would be when the roar of guns and hoarse
shouts from without announced that the picked
troopers had actually launched their long deferred
assault. Jack had taken it upon himself
to close in on the chief worker in that little
coterie, and have the glory of capturing Slippery
Slim unaided but meanwhile Perk might find
plenty of action in holding up those two others
who were second in importance only to the leading
figure.</p>

<p class='c013'>The tension had become almost unendurable
when suddenly there broke out a frightful uproar—women
were shrieking, children’s high
pitched voices told of intense alarm; men gave
tongue, and above it all guns began to sound with
deadly import, until the basin rocked with the
dreadful clamor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack waited no longer, but giving Perk a kick
on the shins to tell him to get busy he rushed
headlong toward Slippery Slim, holding his automatic
ready for instant service, knowing as he
did that such a desperate bad man as Slim
was reckoned from all accounts, would not be
apt to surrender so long as there remained the
slightest chance for a getaway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nor was he mistaken in judging the character
of the man who had so long defied the shrewdest
detectives of the United States Secret Service
for when Slim found his way to the open air
barred by such a determined looking figure, he
snatched out his handy gat and made as if to open
fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>For once he was just a trifle too slow with his
service gun, for Jack, clever lad that he was
along the line of firing off-hand, managed to send
a bullet through Slim’s right shoulder that crippled
him, so that his own weapon went rattling
to the stone under his feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put ’em up!” Jack was saying, covering his
man as he spoke and having no desire to commit
suicide, Slippery Slim obeyed the call; and
instantly afterwards suffering the painful ignominy
of having his wrists encircled by a pair
of nice new steel bracelets.</p>

<p class='c013'>So far so good, with Jack, his own share of the
capture an accomplished fact, able to turn in
order to lend Perk a helping hand. It was not
needed, for Perk had descended on those two
muscular chaps like a thunderbolt, knocking one
down with a terrific jolt under the chin and
causing the other to look along the short barrel
of his blued automatic, he having discarded the
repeating rifle for the time being in favor of
the easier handled pocket gun.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the trio of discomfited rogues were all
handcuffed, Jack and his reliable partner turned
and faced the other way, so as to be ready for a
rush, should some of those valorous generals
decide to take advantage of the defensive security
of the rock cave, and bolt into its gaping mouth.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being actually attempted they met with
a demoralizing surprise when they found themselves
the objects of a hot fire, that brought about
a complete right-about face movement and
presently forced their ignominious surrender to
the gallant Colonel Morales and his fierce fighters,
who had once before gone through an interesting
campaign in that same old extinct volcano
vent, with warlike redskins as their opponents.</p>

<p class='c013'>The end was not long in coming, with many
of the would-be revolutionists holding up their
hands in complete surrender others escaping
by losing themselves along the scraggly sides of
the mountains and not a few either slain outright,
or seriously wounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and his chum had a chance to meet the
doughty Colonel Morales, pride of the Mexican
army, and be congratulated on their clever work
of rounding up such a jack-o’-lantern, fly-by-night
as Slim Garrabrant. Of course the two
comrades were eager to start back to the other
side of the border, since complications might
come up over their legal warrant to arrest a criminal
so badly wanted by the Washington authorities,
but who had made his headquarters south
of the international line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly they handed over Slim’s two lieutenants,
who would have to answer to a charge
of being hand-in-glove with those plotting generals,
and doubtless find themselves incarcerated
in a Mexican dungeon for some years, a fate that
made Perk shudder to contemplate.</p>

<p class='c013'>While he stood guard over their prisoner, Jack
sent Perk off at dawn, mounted on one of the
cavalry horses, and accompanied by a soldier
who would fetch back both animals, Perk’s duty
being to get the stranded ship off the ground,
and drop down at a more convenient spot closer
to the former mountain stronghold of the tiger-like
Yaquis.</p>

<p class='c013'>By nightfall they were hundreds of miles on
their way over Arizona and New Mexico, Jack
having decided to carry his prisoner, whose
wound did not prove to be very serious, though
painful enough—all the way to Washington, and
present him to his superior, with his customary
air of not realizing that he had done anything
extraordinary.</p>

<p class='c013'>That this thrilling feat was only a common
occurrence in the lives of such intrepid manhunters
as serve the Government through the
agency of the Secret Service and that from time
to time Jack and Perk might with reason be
expected to duplicate such adventurous feats can
be set down as certain; indeed, the title of the
next number in the Sky Detective Series, “<i>Eagles
of the Sky; or With Jack Ralston Along the Air
Lanes</i>,” a tale of the smugglers of the Florida
Coast, will grip the reader from start to finish,
and prove to be one of the most thrilling stories
ever written for lovers of action and valor.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

  <h2 id='ch01' class='c011'>CHAPTER I <br /> <br />READY FOR THE TAKE-OFF</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>It was a day in the late Fall when Jack
Ralston, accompanied by his best pal, Gabe
Perkiser, known simply as “Perk” by all his
friends, found themselves climbing out of a
hired taxi that had halted on the border of
Candler Flying Field just a short distance out
of Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! reg’lar mob out here today, seems
like,” observed Perk, as he took note of the
triple line of cars parked around the field, with
its numerous up-to-date hangars, and with ships
coming and going every few minutes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, you see Perk, it happens to be a big day
at stunt flying, with fat prizes for the winners.
All the better for us, I’d say, since our take-off
will hardly make a ripple in the pond, with all
this confusion going on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing, my boy,” continued Perk, with
one of his humorous grins that betokened a good-natured
chap; “and privacy’s just what we crave.
I guess now that might be the mail comin’ from
down East an’ New York?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A rotten guess then, Perk,” chortled the
other; “Eastern mail boat was due here at six-ten
this morning; the Pitcairn Aviation concern
handle that route, as well as the run between
Atlanta and Miami down in Florida; and I’m
telling you for a fact the boys holding the stick
with <i>that</i> corporation are nearly always on time
to the dot, come storm, come fog as thick as
pea-soup. The schedule I glimpsed at the Atlanta
post office gave the time of the East Coast
ship as seven-thirty P. M.; that from New Orleans
at six-thirty P. M.; and the one from
Chicago about the same time. So you see it
couldn’t be a mail crate dropping down right
now, unless they’d had to make a forced landing,
and lost time in making repairs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, come to think of it I sure did hear a
bus passin’ over just at peep o’ day,” admitted
Perk. “Let’s have a look-in while we’re here,
and see what a bag o’ tricks these stunt flyers
are holdin’ up their sleeves, so’s to give this
crowd a row o’ thrills.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suits me, Perk; no great hurry about our
jumping off, so long as we pull the gun before
dark sets in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! little difference it makes on a patch
as well lighted as this Candler Field o’ your
home city, old boy; and with a flashlight beacon
set every ten miles all the way down to Orleans,
to keep us on our course. Look at that guy
fairly burning the air like hot cakes—he must
be tryin’ to beat the speed record, I guess, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hardly a day comes without some record
going by the board,” remarked Jack, who had
a reputation as a safe and sane pilot, although
on occasion he had been known to put through
some tricks so death-defying as to make the
hearts of the spectators seem to jump up in
their throats with the thrill.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was quite correct when he stated that
Atlanta was the home city of his close friend
and chum; although Jack’s family had moved
away years back, and become fruit raisers in
far-off California. Still, having spent some
years in the Georgia capital Jack always liked
to drop in and renew a limited number of old
friendships when opportunity offered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack Ralston had begun his aviation work
starting at the lowest round, that of a Gypsy
pilot, flying an ancient boat at County Fairs and
Harvest Home gatherings; doing aerial stunts,
and “bailing out” by means of a parachute while
another pilot ran the ship; also taking up air
minded “sand-bags” as passengers at so much
each person.</p>

<p class='c013'>From this modest beginning he had finally
accepted a position with an aircraft corporation
having contracts with the Post Office Department
at Washington for carrying the mails, and
later on express matter as well; and last of all
working for Uncle Sam through joining the
Secret Service corps of skillful detectives, whose
activities covered every part of the Nation, and
even to adjacent countries as well.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the Government wearied of the bold
doings of one “Slippery Slim” Garrabrant, and
decided to “clip the wings” of that audacious
freebooter and bogus-money crook, it was only
natural they should pick Jack for this service.
The reasons for doing so were many, but what
counted most was Jack’s well known cleverness
as an all-round air pilot; for it happened that
the slick rogue who had been giving the revenue
men such a wild-goose chase, with his thumb
held up to his nose, so to speak, was himself a
remarkable master of the air lanes, he having
been an ace as a flying pilot over with the army
on the Argonne front in France.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since as a rule this troublesome offender carried
on his bold enterprises by means of a handy
plane—frequently with a single assistant, who
helped handle both ship and cargo—the man
thus selected to put a crimp in his activities was
likewise given full permission to engage a helper
from the same arm of the Government forces,
one who must of course know something about
the handling of a plane, so that in case of necessity
he could serve as co-pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack lost no time in picking Gabe Perkiser,
otherwise known simply as “Perk”—a man who
had supped with adventure since he was “knee
high to a duck”—a half Yankee—half Canuck,
drifting into the army, and serving with the
sausage observation balloon corps over in
France; from which patriotic occupation he
later on became a champion light-weight boxer.
Leaving the ring while as yet undefeated he
served for several years with the Canadian
Mounted Police. Here his smartness in usually
fetching back his man, no matter what the difficulties
that had to be surmounted, attracted
the attention of a gentleman connected with
Uncle Sam’s Secret Service, just then moose
hunting over the northern border, who finally
influenced Perk to join up with his force.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and the other had met under peculiar
conditions when both were tracking a bunch of
check raisers floating across the country and
leaving a wide swath of victims in their path.
They had become more than friends, although
meeting but seldom; then, when the opportunity
came for Jack to call upon Perk to join him in
the new job that had been turned over to his
charge, the latter had responded with alacrity.</p>

<p class='c013'>So here they were, on the threshold of an
affair that promised to engage their united talents
in running down the leader of the most
troublesome gang of counterfeit currency makers
known to the Government agents in the last
ten years.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every clue possessed at Headquarters had
been turned over to Jack at the time he was
given authority to carry on as the situation demanded;
although this information was a bit
limited, and much was left to the shrewdness
of the two trail hounds themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no hurry at all, and Jack had
always been one of those cautious workers who
meant to provide for all sorts of emergencies.
Only too well did he know how many a splendid
undertaking went on the rocks from lack of
foreseeing the next move on the part of the
astute criminals whose apprehension meant so
much to the Government, as well as the folks
they were victimizing.</p>

<p class='c013'>But by now he had decided everything was
arranged so far as human means would permit,
and that it was high time they started on their
long chase. Their boat, a Stinson Detroiter, a
monoplane with a Wright Whirlwind motor,
and reckoned to be an unusually swift craft, was
already loaded, and ready for immediate departure.
It had been stored in one of the big
hangars connected with the Candler Flying
Field but could be taxied into position when
Jack felt ready to skip off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their flying togs were also contained in a
locker in the same hangar, and could be donned
in a jiffy, even to the ’chute harness that was
so familiar to Jack, and a constant reminder of
early experiences when he was accustomed to
carry out his daily program of “quitting the
ship” with as much <i>sang froid</i> as though the
jump into space from a five thousand foot ceiling
were absolutely next to nothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>But plainly Perk was becoming a bit restless,
as though eager to be on his way; which fact
doubtless influenced Jack to eventually give the
word that took them to their hangar. Here
they commenced preparing for a night flight
that was expected to land them in New Orleans,
where Jack was to interview a certain representative
of the Government service, from whom
he anticipated receiving a few valuable tips that
would give them something tangible and serve
as a beginning of their arduous chase.</p>

<p class='c013'>While they were thus engaged someone
hailed them with a boisterous greeting, at which
Perk grinned, and made a suitable reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hey, Scotty, this your night off, is it—got
in from your route okay, and stepped out to see
the boys cut a few figger-eights in the sky—just
can’t keep away from the game, even when you
got a lay-off? What’s new, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They told me at the house you expected to
step off tonight, boys—is that a fact, or did they
slip an easy one over me, I want to know?” demanded
the other, who was apparently a mail
pilot friend of theirs—in fact, having the adjoining
room at the small hotel where they were
stopping.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” Jack told him, secretive as usual,
“we’re going further, and boosting the Stinson
Detroiter ship by showing what it has to set it
above most other boats. Plans not fully arranged
as yet, but we’re on our way; so it’s good-bye,
and good luck to you, Scotty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about that news, Scotty?” the insistent
Perk went on to demand, being by nature one of
those stubborn chaps who can never be happy
until they get what they are after, no matter
how trivial it may seem.</p>

<p class='c013'>The air mail pilot scratched his head, and
then with a grin answered Perk’s question.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much along the line of aviation;
but something queer happened to me—say, did
you boys sleep at home last night while I was
on the road?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We sure did,” Perk told him, and then
added: “What makes you ask that, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Didn’t hear any sort of racket in my den
did you, fellows?” continued the other; at which
Perk, after exchanging a look of bewilderment
with his pal, hastened to answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a thing, Scotty; but then you know I
sleep like a log; and it’d have to be a thunderclap
to wake me up; what’s been going on?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You got me guessing, Perk,” said the other,
with a look of disgust; “only when I got in this
morning I found my room looking like a hurricane
had struck it, my things tossed out of drawers,
my trunk broken open, and say, you never
saw such a dirty mess. Course I asked the boss
what it meant; but he was as much surprised
as I was—talked with every servant from the
cook down to Mary the chamber maid; but
nobody could tell a darned thing about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again Jack and Perk exchanged a swift
glance, as though the same idea had struck both
of them. Scotty did not appear to notice this,
being too worked up with the mystery that had
so suddenly gripped his fortunes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did you lose anything worth while, Scotty?”
Jack asked, in a voice that suggested sympathy;
but to his surprise the other shook his head in
the negative, and even grinned as he lifted his
heavy eyebrows to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s the funny part of it, boys; whoever
the sneak thief was, he didn’t even dent me a
little bit—so far as I c’n see not a blessed thing
is missing—fact is, I’m even better off than before
he paid that queer visit, ’cause he left this
old pocketbook mixed up with my traps; and
it ain’t mine for a fact, though I’m meaning to
spend the little wad of dough it holds. Like
manna coming down to the children of Israel
in the Wilderness, wouldn’t you say, boys?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lucky old hoss you are, Scotty,” remarked
Perk, enviously; while Jack nodded his head as
though to echo the sentiment.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c014'>CHAPTER II <br /> <br />THE LUCK OF SCOTTY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Happen to have that pocketbook along with
you, Scotty?” asked Jack, in a matter of fact
tone; just as though he might be possessed of
ordinary curiosity concerning so amazing a
visit; since never before had he heard of a night
prowler leaving his own money behind him,
when his intention had been to rob his victim.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing, Jack,” promptly replied the air
mail pilot; “here, take a squint at my Christmas
present, dropped in by old Santa Claus
a bit before the reg’lar holiday season,” and with
a laugh he chucked the object in question into
the hand of the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Old, just as you remarked, Scotty,” observed
Jack, “and used a long time. It must have
slipped out of his pocket when he worked your
stuff over to mix it up like the devil.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Open it up and see what the blessed chump
left me in place of his card,” the other continued,
looking exceedingly proud over his lucky
find.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did that with alacrity; in fact it
was what he intended doing, for reasons of his
own; something more than curiosity influencing
him, it would appear.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gee whiz! a neat little bunch of the needful,
I’d say, Scotty, old hoss!” burst out the envious
Perk, his eyes fixed full upon the contents of
the much worn pocketbook, which Jack was
holding in his hand and apparently interested
in counting, for there were a number of bank
notes for various amounts, and among them just
three five-dollar bills, seemingly quite fresh,
though a bit soiled, as though they had been in
circulation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nineteen smackers in all,” announced Perk,
showing that he had also been keeping tabs on
the count. “Well, wouldn’t that knock you cold
though? Huh? that same caller must’ve been
looking for <i>me</i>, and just missed connections by
striking the next door. Well, here’s wishing you
the same old luck every time a sneak thief pays
you a visit, Scotty boy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack on his part was feeling of the three five-dollar
bills, and holding them up to the light
from the western sun that managed to come
into the hangar by way of the open doors.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What ails you, Jack?” demanded the recipient
of Fortune’s smiles, as he noticed these
strange actions on the part of his new friend.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much,” he was told, “only I’m going
to give you a bit of advice, partner, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to it, boy; always willing to take it
when it seems sound!” snapped the mail carrier,
briskly enough, still more than curious.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you’re wise, Scotty,” went on Jack, smilingly,
“you’ll not try to pass any one of these
five-dollar bills until you’ve asked the opinion
of some bank teller—it might get you into
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Zowie! what’s that you’re saying, Jack—don’t
tell me they’re off-color bills, counterfeits
in fact. Wouldn’t that be a rotten deal to hand
out, and me figgering how I’d spend them? Is
<i>that</i> what you mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon it’s so, Scotty, much as I hate to
knock your good luck,” Jack told him, with a
shake of his head. “I happened to have a little
experience in a small bank some years ago and
they did say I showed signs of being a clever
detector of bad money. That’s a clever job all
right; but I’m afraid it won’t stand the wash
worth a cent. Go slow, and don’t count your
chickens before they’re hatched. Also I’d advise
you not to go around telling about your windfall
until you’ve shown this stuff to some friendly
bank official, whose advice you’d be willing to
take. If he says it’s good stuff why forget what
I’m saying, and go the limit. But we’d better
be finishing our own job, Perk, and get off on
our jump.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Scotty hung around for a short time, looking
puzzled, as though he hardly knew how much
to believe. What Jack had said in his friendly
fashion had doubtless cast quite a damper on
certain bright dreams in which he had been indulging.
However, he finally decided to take
himself off, evidently eager to know whether
the laugh was on him or not, for he called out:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goodbye, Jack, Perk; and be sure to look me
up when next you drop in at Candler Field Airport;
like as not I’ll still be on my old job here,
unless they decide to transfer me somewhere else.
And say, Jack, I’m meaning to take your advice,
and get an opinion on this here stuff ’fore I try
to pass it out on any old duffer. So-long boys
and luck!”</p>

<p class='c013'>When the two comrades, adventure bound,
found themselves alone they looked at each other
in silence for almost a full minute, when a grin
started to travel over Perk’s well bronzed face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, wouldn’t it jar you though, to have such
luck knock at your door, and then give you a sly
kick?” he demanded of his companion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To tell the honest truth, Perk, I’m not thinking
about Scotty and his queer windfall; it’s
our own great good luck that’s making me suspect
we’re bound to carry this job through with
flying colors.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Eh? now what d’ye mean by saying that?”
asked the other hastily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right in the beginning, Perk, we seem to
have stumbled on a nice little plum in the shape
of a clue—flung directly at our heads, you might
say in the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! do you mean to tell me those bogus
notes were off the same plates we’ve been
hearing so much about lately that I’ve been
dreamin’ I was tied hand an’ foot, an’ poked
under a dozen bales of them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just that, as sure as you live, partner,” said
Jack, composedly; but if he could take it so
coolly, not so his right bower who showed signs
of extreme excitement and satisfaction, for he
thrust out his hand, that had so often been an
object of vast respect on the part of some welter
weight boxer, and insisted that Jack accept a
gentle shake.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re sure Fortune’s favorites,” Perk was
saying, striking an attitude as he thus proudly
spoke; “an’ with such luck hoverin’ over our
heads I vow all the Lower Regions with its devils
can’t prevail against us. But see here, old hoss,
there’s more than chance in this break o’ the
party who broke through Scotty’s door, and
panned all his traps—I guess now he must have
missed a cylinder, an’ jest passed us by in a
ground loop.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was accustomed to the other’s quaint way
of expressing himself, for he lost no time in
adding:</p>

<p class='c013'>“About that way, I take it, Perk. And if
what we suspect turns out to be true, it stands to
reason there’s some sort of big combine back of
it all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“With this same Slippery Slim Garrabrant
pulling the wires for the whole bunch, is that
what you mean, Jack?” demanded the other flyer
quickly; for when once set on the right track
Perk’s mind could travel speedily enough.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s certainly his brain that’s built up this
wide flim-flam trade in the make believe green
stuff that’s been fooling a whole lot of bank tellers,
it’s so near the genuine article. To
smash the combine we’ve got to check up on
Slim; after he’s caged the entire arrangement’s
bound to fall through.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, partner; and them’s my sentiments
every time,” admitted the eager Perk. “And
here, when we’re starting out to pull off our
fresh stunt, I’m wishing all the luck that’s going
to our little game. Meaning to give her a last
checking over, eh, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s a habit of mine, as you know, Perk; and
you might amuse yourself stowing the cargo
we’ve taken aboard, so’s to let us have room for
our feet when we take off. From the looks of
the junk you picked up anybody’d reckon we
planned to go into camp for a week or two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, mebbe that’s what’ll happen to us before
we strike pay dirt in this ticklish job,”
asserted Perk, stoutly. “You know we figgered
things out, and made up our minds this same
slick article of a Slim might have his hangout
over the line in Old Mexico, where he prints
his bad bills, and then comes across the line with
a big bunch in his ship, so’s to scatter the stuff
around to his agents in Texas and Arizona, or
it might be all through Southern California. If
that guess turns out to be a bullseye we might
be away off the line of travel for days at a stretch,
and a grub stake’d turn the trick okay, I’m thinking,
boss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack made no reply, for he was already busily
engaged in looking over his crate. This was, as
he had mentioned, an old habit, contracted in
the early days of his career as an aviator of sorts;
and most likely such extreme caution had saved
his life more than once.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he too worked close by, Perk was thinking
more or less about something that had caught
his ever watchful eye just before they entered
the hangar to make these last preparations for
their southern flight. As usual he was unable
to keep his speculations entirely to himself, since
he always liked to compare notes, and find out
whether his companion’s views coincided with
his own.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, Jack, did you happen to notice that
Ryan ship they’d just taken out of the shed before
ours?” he demanded, while still lifting
packages of various supplies, and stowing them
away in a shipshape fashion; so they would not
be likely to shift, and thus imperil the safety
of himself and comrade, should they chance to
encounter rough weather later on.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not particularly,” came the answer. “I was
too busy over my own affairs to bother with anything
that didn’t concern me in the least. What
of it, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much, old hoss, only it was a next
to new bus, and hadn’t been flown more’n a few
thousand air miles, I’d guess. Couple of fellers
seemed to be the crew, one of ’em lookin’ like
he might be a pilot; and the other a chap that
was out to have a jolly good time sportin’ for
sport. I saw him handlin’ some sort of gun,
which made me guess he was down South for
the shootin’ season—mebbe after bear in the
Louisiana canebrakes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack laughed as if amused, for he had noted
the way in which the other made this stab at
what might be the designs of the unknown
parties.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Feel a bit envious I take it, Perk,” he observed,
laconically. “Always did yearn for the
day to come when you’d have a ship of your
own, and could spend all your spare time jumping
about the country, enjoying yourself with
rod and gun. Cheer up, old sport, you may live
to see that day yet, if things break right for us
in a few big games like this one we’re running
down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thanks for your good luck wishes, Jack,” the
other was saying; “I c’n just picture the bully
times that pair’ll like enough have sitting by
their camp-fire, living on game they’ve knocked
over, and not caring a darn whether school
keeps or not. Oh! well, if I live long enough
mebbe I may have a whiff of that kind of life
before I kick off for keeps; they say everything
comes to the man who waits, and that’s me.
There, that finishes my job, with everything
stowed away as slick as you please. When you’re
ready, Jack, we’ll be on our way.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c014'>CHAPTER III <br /> <br />HEADED SOUTH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Apparently Jack had completed his task
about the same time, for he was adjusting his
’chute harness, without which he seldom made a
long distance flight. This was only second nature
to him, because of the long experience he
had had in barnstorming, and doing stunts for
a living in years gone by.</p>

<p class='c013'>This accomplished, he stepped outside the
hangar, and beckoned to a couple of ground
workers who chanced to be close by, possibly
in anticipation of their services being required,
with a tip in prospect.</p>

<p class='c013'>Between them the ship was moved to the open,
and after that it would be a simple thing for
Jack to taxi across the strip of ground adjoining
the big Pitcairn hangar, so as to face such
wind as was stirring.</p>

<p class='c013'>With what Perk had said concerning the new
Ryan monoplane and its crew still fresh in his
mind, Jack did give a brief glance in that quarter.
He could only see that both men were fully
equipped with dungarees, helmets, and even
chutes fastened to their backs; which combination
was an effectual disguise, since their best
friends might have failed to recognize either
of them offhand.</p>

<p class='c013'>The one who was garbed in what seemed to
be fresh clean overalls, and who must be the
employer, seemed to feel a mild interest in their
movements, for he was looking that way through
his goggles, that had been pulled down as if in
preparation for some species of flight. The
other was busying himself adjusting something,
and from his greasy dungarees it was evident
he must be the working pilot of the Ryan craft.</p>

<p class='c013'>With all the bustle that was going on covering
the stunt flying and speed races, Jack did
not bother taking a second look; he failed to
have the same interest in the possible sporting
excursion of the unknown pair that had gripped
Perk and hence failed to let the matter occupy
any more of his limited time.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon both settled down in their respective
places in the double cockpit of the ship,
Jack of course occupying the front seat, since
he had been placed in command, with the other
acting as co-pilot and observer.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a very decent crate taken in all, that
had been secured for their work on this special
occasion, for Uncle Sam is never stingy in supplying
his agents of the Secret Service with
whatever they need, from means for swift travel
to the customary “grub” necessary to their upkeep
when “on the road.” These air detectives
in whom we are particularly interested just now,
as a rule were angling for big fish, and it was
absolutely necessary they should be given a free
hand when making their demands for proper
backing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it’s goodbye to Candler Field for us
right now,” remarked Perk, as he shot a general
look around, being more or less interested in
the exciting events being pulled off in the air
circus. “Playtime’s past, and now we’ve just
got to put in our best licks along the line of
business. Huh! seems like them two guys are
meaning to pull out right on our heels, from the
lively way that greasy lad is jumping around—keeps
an eye on us in the bargain, as if it mattered
a lick whether we did get going before
he was ready to follow suit. Some folks never
do like anybody to show ’em their dust, even
when it don’t matter a pinch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then Jack waved his hand toward the two
hostlers whom he had generously tipped, and
pulled the gun in his accustomed careful fashion;
after which they started along the level
field for the takeoff, there being small necessity
for a runway on such a generous fairway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Faster and faster they flew along the ground,
and then with their wheels parting contact with
the earth up they started at an easy incline.
The roar of the motor already drowned most of
the clamor from the surging crowd, while the
racket of the whizzing propeller added to the
chorus so joyous to the ears of all real air pilots,
since nothing pleases them more than to feel they
are masters of a ship that is in “apple-pie” condition
for battling whatever lies ahead, be it
storm, fog or whatnot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Somehow Perk was twisting his head around
as if curious to ascertain whether that Ryan
crate had succeeded in imitating their example,
and was already making the preliminary dash
across the field—which luckily enough had
chanced to be fairly clear of maneuvering
planes, either descending, taking off, or being
taxied into position for the next stunt on the
program.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was getting well along by this
time, and already the first dim shadows of approaching
night were to be seen slipping
out from certain patches of pine trees ahead.
But the higher they climbed, now that a start
had been accomplished, the lighter it would become,
what with a lower horizon, and the sun
still hanging in plain sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once free from any possibility of any contact
with the wheeling and ducking planes—some of
which were doing the barrel roll, and others
making successive somersaults, with the daring
pilots proceeding while in an inverted position—Jack
could start spiraling, and climbing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rapidly was Candler Field fading from view
behind them since Jack had swung toward the
south, as if to lay his course directly for New
Orleans. Perk seemed to find a subtle attraction
back where they had just come from, since he
was again turning his head with nothing else to
do save gratify his innocent curiosity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! ’pears like they might be meaning to
strike for the Louisiana canebrake country, and
black bear diggings, just like I said,” he was
telling himself, with a chuckle of amusement
over his shrewd guess. “And say, that little
Ryan crate’s no slouch ’bout making speed, I’d
mention. Come along you sportin’ crowd—plenty
of room in the ceiling overhead, an’ nixey
a chance to bring about a collision. Take your
choice, and cut out for all you’re worth, boys.
If you get there before we do, just tell ’em we’re
acomin’ too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk continued to amuse himself in watching
the antics of the rival ship, and indulging in
all kinds of wild speculations as to what the real
object of those two sporty looking occupants
might prove to be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently thus far not the slightest suspicion
had entered his mind that the taking to the air
of the shining Ryan boat had the first thing to
do with their own skipping out, and heading
toward the Crescent City.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like as not when it gets real dark after a
bit,” Perk continued to say, being addicted to
talking to himself more or less, “we’ll soon lose
her, and have the field all to ourselves. Only
moving thing I c’n sight back there, ’cept them
circlin’ buzzards huntin’ for a carrion supper.
Guess everything’s going along first class
and we’re in for a comfortable night run down
over the corn and sugarcane country. This is
the life for little Perk, you hear me saying,
everybody—it’s got the boxin’ game, and even
that outdoor life up with the Mounties in Canada,
beat to a frazzle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk busied himself with his duties for
some time, and presently became aware of the
fact that evening was actually at hand; for the
sun had dropped out of sight over in the far
west, and looking down he found it absolutely
impossible to distinguish what lay beneath them
some two thousand feet more or less earthward—there
might be forests, farms, hills or swales
following each other in rapid succession; but all
masked by the sable curtains of night. When
the moon rose later on, its light would not afford
them any opportunity for marking any peculiarities
of the ground down there, since it must
simply present the appearance of a swiftly moving
panorama.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, moved once more by his old curiosity
concerning the ship that had started off immediately
after their own jump, again twisted his
head so as to take another backward look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hanged if she ain’t keeping on our tail right
along,” he told himself, as if a bit surprised,
though not in the least troubled, since there
could be no possible connection between this
Ryan monoplane and their own old bus, bent
on reeling off so many miles per hour, and aiming
to make the airport at New Orleans by early
dawn or before, according to how the weather
treated them, and the speed Jack could coax
from his aerial steed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Further inspection convinced Perk that the
rival ship was neither gaining nor losing as the
two sped along their way; a fact that began to
make him “sit up and take notice,” and then
express himself confidentially:</p>

<p class='c013'>“By jinks! it looks to me like that clever little
Ryan bus could make circles around our tub
’less Jack c’n squeeze a lot more snap from our
Whirlwind motor. Now what game c’n that
pair of sports be playin’ right now, I want to
know—must be they’re so used to bettin’ on
anything an’ everything they’re meanin’ to keep
right on our tail all night long, just to make us
hump along, and get the laugh on us poor
guys.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c014'>CHAPTER IV <br /> <br />THE GRIM PURSUER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>As the minutes crept along Perk’s uneasiness
commenced to make itself more manifest, finally
reaching such a condition that he felt it would
ease his mind if only he could get the opinion
of his companion on the subject.</p>

<p class='c013'>To do this it would be necessary that they
should make use of the head earphones that had
been taken along for this particular purpose.
Accordingly he quickly adjusted his own, and
then proceeded to advise Jack as to what he
wished to do. Since these useful adjuncts of the
pilot’s outfit were so arranged that they could
be slipped on and off with little loss of time,
it was an easy matter for Perk to apply them,
after which he went on to speak.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, seems like that pesky little Ryan insect’s
been tailing us right along, though mebbe
now you didn’t notice it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know it, Perk—fact is I proved that fact
to my own satisfaction, for twice now I’ve
changed our course, once into the west, and
again heading into the southwest, even if it
didn’t catch your attention.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You did that same; and say, what happened,
Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a blessed thing,” came the immediate
answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They still hung on our tail, do you mean,
old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like they did—queer how two pilots,
strangers both, would take a notion to change
their course, not once but twice running,” commented
Jack in his non-committal fashion that
always had Perk guessing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Strikes me as something more than a happy
chance,” asserted Perk, beginning to throw off
that comfortable feeling with which he had
wrapped himself as he contemplated a steady
going night run, with never a reason for anything
gripping them by way of excitement;
“ev’ry little movement of that Ryan two-seater’s
got a meanin’ of its own. Now what ails the
ducks I want to know—how c’n our movements
have a mite to do with what they’re planning
to carry out—got any idea along them lines, old
hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing definite as yet,” answered Jack; “I
was starting to figure it out just when you barged
in, and opened this talk fest up with your question.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, come to think of it, what did you make
out of that stiff yarn Scotty put over on us a
while ago?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was raw stuff for a fact; but I don’t question
anything he told us, remember, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whoever his mysterious visitor was he must
have been hunting for something, that’s dead
sure!” declared Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Something he didn’t find, either,” continued
Jack’s assistant pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Scotty was ready to swear to that fact, and
he ought to know.” Jack countered by saying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“But see here, old hoss, you’ve got some sorter
idea what the game might abeen, haven’t you
for a fact?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon I know why the sneak thief failed
to carry away the thing he was looking for, if
that’s what you mean, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As what, boss—I’m all worked up wantin’
to know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perhaps the reason might have been because
the object of his search happened at that very
time to be safe and snug in the inside pocket
of this same coat I’m wearing under my overalls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At hearing this startling announcement Perk
gave a quick look into his pal’s face, there being
just enough light remaining in the western sky
to allow this searching glance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! now I’m beginning to get somewhere,
and ready to quit this gropin’ around,
like a man in a London fog—that letter you had
this very morning from Headquarters—somehow
’r other some of the gang had wind of your
gettin’ it, and they guessed it’d be kept
safe under lock and key in your room at the
hotel; and then they got balled up about the
number on the door, so they broke into the wrong
room. Jack, am I on the right track?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems that’s so, according to my notion,
Perk; unless I miss my guess that’s the way
things stand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A disgusted grunt from Perk told that he did
not feel very happy over certain facts in the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gosh-a-mighty!” he burst out, explosively,
“if that’s right, then the tricky crowd know you’n
me are on this case—that even right now we’re
starting out to pluck their tail feathers, and
fetch that master-crook to the bar!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! I expected that would happen,” said
Jack, indifferently. “Having been told by several
of the best men in the service that Slim was
the smartest all-round dopester known in all the
land, I anticipated that he’d have means for
finding out that fact long ago—that there might
be a leak around Headquarters; for spies can
worm in almost anywhere, given an opportunity,
and the backing of a big bunch of jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yet that fact don’t seem to rattle you worth
a red cent, old hoss,” continued the puzzled
Perk, who ofttimes found the actions of his cool
partner a mystery he could not solve, because of
his own more impetuous ways.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope not,” was all Jack said in reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thunder and lightning!” ejaculated the co-pilot,
as if an illuminating idea had suddenly
flashed through his brain—“that Ryan bus,
Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what of it?” demanded the one at the
stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What if that sporty guy I told you about
should turn out to be the critter who broke into
Scotty’s room, and made it a complete wreck?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It could happen that way, Perk; seems like
you’re working on a warm scent right now. Pity
we didn’t get a good look at the gentleman before
he hid his face behind that helmet and goggles;
then at least we’d know him if ever we happened
to run across his trail.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The other was almost frothing at the mouth
through disgust and anger combined; but he
managed to say, with a select few hard words
interlarded as a vent to his outraged feelings:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Give me half a chance and I’ll mark him so
there’s be no difficulty in locating the sneak when
we meet him again—I’d put a bit of lead
through his arm that’d keep him out of the scrap
for a week of Sundays; or else clip off one of
his ears, to stamp him as a low-down crook.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack knew full well that this was no idle threat
on the part of his running mate; for Perk had a
reputation as a pistol shot second to none in the
entire service, being a natural born marksman.</p>

<p class='c013'>He lapsed into a spell of silence after making
that vicious remark; but from the way he
glanced back again and again it looked as
though Perk meant to keep close tabs on the
craft that was dogging their own ship so
steadily.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were roaring on their way, and it would
seem as if they must be showing a clean pair of
heels to anything in their rear; but just the same,
Perk, with the vision of an air-minded individual,
could readily understand how the speedy
Ryan plane was slowly but insidiously picking
up on them continuously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blamed nuisance,” he was muttering to himself
when this important fact became a positive
truth; “guess now that rip-snorter could make
circles round us, if so be he wanted to. Shucks!
what’s left to us I want to know; an’ just what
does he ’spect to accomplish with all this chasin’
us? Might as well get out my little old
six-shot bear gun, so’s to be ready in case
there’s any sort o’ ruction aheadin’ our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The idea seemed to afford him a strange sort
of grim satisfaction, for bending down he ran
his hand under the coaming of the cockpit; to
almost immediately withdraw a very decent
looking sporting repeating rifle, evidently his
working tool whenever he felt disposed to spend
a week in the wilds, either alone, or with some
boon companions also yearning for wild game
and the much desired campfire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold tight, Perk,” Jack was saying just
then; “going into a nose dive, and see if that
will upset his calculations; for he’s got me buffaloed
all right as to what’s in the wind!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Almost immediately they turned the nose of
their craft earthward, and went down on a
swift slant. Perk kept his head turned even as
this maneuvre was being executed, and what he
saw was something calculated to almost take
his breath away; for where the pursuing Ryan
ship loomed up as a shadowy form, vivid
splashes, as of fire, were coming in quick succession—he
could even imagine he heard the pulsating
staccato reports following each other in
succession, just as in those never-to-be-forgotten
days when he would have a covey of
devil-may-care German air fighters stepping on
the tail of his old-fashioned boat, and peppering
him from their rapid-firing guns!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c014'>CHAPTER V <br /> <br />THE DUEL IN THE AIR</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The significant flashes abruptly ceased; but
Perk realized this was only because the expert
pilot handling that same Ryan wasp was also
ducking down in an exact copy of their own
game.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the moment Perk lost sight of the shadowy
pursuing craft; then Jack changed his tactics,
and once again brought his boat on an even
keel. Perk strained his eyesight in an endeavor
to pick up the other ship after it too had swung
into a direct course.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Devil take that guy at the stick,” he stormed
to himself, although Jack caught almost every
word, since the earphones were still in operation,
“he’s seen our move, an’ gone us one better.
No slouch o’ a pilot, either, I’ll admit. When
that gent who goes by the name o’ Slippery Slim
picks his gang he knows how to pull trumps
out of the pack all right. Give him another
shoot, Jack, old hoss; mebbe he wont be so lucky
next time. He’s got some kind o’ a rapid-fire
shooter aboard, and had started to send a hail
o’ lead ’bout our ears just as you turned the trick
on him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was apparently quite willing to give a
repeat, for hardly had the other ceased shouting
than they again shot down in a dizzy dive
that seemed likely to lower their altitude by
something like five hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was keeping a close watch, and knew
that once more the grim pursuer had copied
their daring maneuvre.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s a good one, or I’ll eat my hat!” he burst
out, as they were “cutting a blue streak” once
more through the growing darkness, and he
could see those suggestive flashes again punctuating
the gloom in their track. “Jack, he’s
started that racket again, don’t you know; and
any second we may get a slug in our belly, bustin’
things all to flinders. Try a razzle-dazzle on
the boob, old broncho!”</p>

<p class='c013'>So making a bank, Jack changed his course,
running at right angles, and if anything at a
faster pace than ever. Perk had the situation
“sized up to a fraction,” as he himself would
have called it; he realized that it was only
through the greatest of good luck they had escaped
being hit by one of those flying missiles;
and that so long as the mysterious enemy kept
using their ship for a flying target they were in
constant peril. Despite all this ducking and
dodging on Jack’s part he did not seem successful
in throwing the pursuing craft off the track.
To be sure the darkness was gradually growing
thicker with every passing minute, and this
seemed to be their only hope of crawling out of
a “hot hole,” according to Perk’s calculations.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk afterwards frankly admitted that he was
frothing at the mouth on account of finding himself
up against a situation where the cards
seemed stacked against him—where his hands
were tied as it were, and that reckless pilot, chasing
after them hell-bent, held all the trumps.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No use tryin’ that game any longer, Jack,
boy!” he yelled suddenly. “See the glim all
’round us, partner—sure as you live they’ve
even got some kind o’ a searchlight aboard, just
like they’d planned all this thing out beforehand.
Guess now it’s up to Little Perk to put
a plug into their game. Hold her steady a bit,
boss; I’m meaning to make ’em sit up an’ take
notice they can’t hog <i>all</i> the fun going. Watch
my smoke, Jack, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a delicate situation without any doubt;
for if those aboard that little Ryan plane, taking
advantage of the halo of light covering the craft
they followed, continued to make use of their
rapidfire gun, the danger of a hit had vastly increased;
but Perk must have some sort of scheme
in mind it was evident, or he would never have
asked his chum to steady the badly wobbling
boat when such action only doubled their peril.</p>

<p class='c013'>Calmly and deliberately, as though simply
bent on fetching down a deer he wanted for
his next camp supper, steady old Perk had his
faithful gun up to his shoulder, and was sighting
that piercing glare of light that marked the bow
of the pursuing aircraft, betraying the presence
of a searchlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Possibly owing to the clamor of their own
working motor Jack could not tell when his
companion unloosed a fusilade of shots; but he
did know that something suddenly changed the
situation, and to their advantage; for as though
a blanket had been tossed over the piercing
ray the illumination abruptly ceased, leaving
them to continue their wild flight shrouded in
encompassing darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, too, the sound of Perk’s exulting yell
was quite enough to tell the story of his success
in finding a glowing target for one of his several
missiles—the old sharpshooter had evidently
lost none of his cunning by reason of a lapse in
action.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Set ’em up in the other alley, boys—give your
Dutch uncle a chance to show an old trick or
two! Now <i>will</i> you be good, or must I give
you another smash in the jaw—better haul off
while the haulin’s good, fellers—I’d sure hate to
make you crack up, and fade out!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Even though his clever shot had doubtless
utterly smashed the searchlight, and put it out
of business, that bothersome rapidfire gun was
still in working order, as Perk discovered when
once more those insistent flashes, following closely
upon each others’ heels, announced a fresh
barrage, with the unseen, unheard hissing bullets
doubtless whizzing all around them.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was adding insult to injury, Perk was
doubtless telling himself, as he realized that his
lucky shot had after all failed to daunt that
stubborn pair in the speedy Ryan ship.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You <i>will</i> have it, seems like,” he growled
to himself; for since he had discarded his earphone
harness just previous to starting his late
“shooting spree,” Perk could no longer hold
intercourse with his fellow flyer; “all right then,
I’ll try some more o’ the same sorter medicine;
what’s good for the goose orter be fine for the
gander. Mind your eye now, boys, and keep
a tight grip on your chutes if anything happens
not down in your gamble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again did the continual flash of spitting fire
from the gun afford the sharpshooter in the
chased ship abundant opportunities for focussing
his aim; although instinct may have
taken the place of vision on Perk’s part.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fortunately Jack must have been expecting
something along those lines, knowing his companion
so well, and how he was always eager
to “repeat” when things were coming his way;
for he kept the flying boat wonderfully steady
just then, even though realizing how such action
doubled their own chances of being hit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was now shooting on general principles,
in hopes of being fortunate enough to find a
billet for one of his random bullets. He went
at the business with all the <i>sang froid</i> of a veteran
fighter, accustomed to meeting hostile
craft up in the wide air spaces, or even above
the clouds—all the fierce delight of matching
his skill and life against a foeman worthy of his
steel had once more gripped the old flying warrior;
and it may be for the moment he deluded
himself with the belief that this was but a reincarnation
of those never-to-be-forgotten days
when all Europe was held fast in the throes of
the grisly war-god.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly Perk ceased firing, nor was this
caused by the magazine of his repeating rifle
being empty—he had seen that the discharges
back yonder were no longer in full blast, showing
that something must have happened to cause
such a sudden cessation to hostilities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before he could attempt to analyze what this
might mean it was all flashed before his questioning
mind—a burst of flames came from the
spot where last he had seen the shadowy shape
of their persistent pursuer clipping through
space like a blazing meteor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk sat there doubled up, his mouth half
open, staring with might and main, as some
object began to drop toward the earth with ever
increasing speed—something which he knew
full well must of necessity be the beautiful little
Ryan plane, which he had admired so much
when at Candler Field at close of the late day,
and before this wild dash into the darkness of
night began.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently one of his missiles (fired with such
grim determination when he “took the bit in
his teeth,” and struck back) had found its mark,
and unleashed the dangerous contents of the
gasoline reservoir, with the splashing fluid instantly
catching fire from the exploding spark
of the running motor.</p>

<p class='c013'>No flyer ever saw his enemy going down in a
flaming coffin without feeling compassion gripping
him; that one moment had changed his
heart from bitter hatred to a sense of pity; knowing
as he must have done that the day might
be near at hand when he too would share in a
similar dreadful fate.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so Perk found himself all in a nervous
tremble as, laying down his gun, he managed
once more to adjust the head harness, so as to
be able to again hold communication with his
fellow adventurer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c014'>CHAPTER VI <br /> <br />PARACHUTE JUMPERS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Just then Jack hurriedly banked, and swung
around as though to double back on their late
course. This of course told Perk the pilot must
be already aware of the terrible tragedy that
was being enacted close at hand, and meant to
see its finish with his own eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the abrupt change in their course he
was in time to catch a glimpse of the flaming
object still spiraling earthwards, a billow of fire
that glowed suggestively in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then far below it seemed to strike the ground—they
heard no sound whatever, but the fire
became stationary; although increasing in fury,
since the wind created by its passage no longer
whipped the devouring flames. Evidently by
the time the conflagration stopped for want of
further material on which to feed, nothing inflammable
would be left of the once haughty
little Ryan masterpiece save the engine, and
other metal parts.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the big idea, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk asked this as a leader, wishing to get a
better grip on his own nerves, since they had
been dreadfully shocked at the dire result of his
random shot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Going to circle around a few times, and drop
down a bit,” came the illuminating reply;
“though I reckon it’s no use, since nothing could
live in all that awful blast.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe not, Jack,” remarked Perk, a bit
cheerily; “but there’s a fair chance neither o’
them guys got snagged in the flash o’ that gas.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Perk, have you some foundation
for saying that?” demanded the other, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure—they jumped all right, boss,” Perk
told him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You saw them do it then, did you, boy?”
continued Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They bailed out okay—I saw two take the
jump right after the first flash came—went down
like plummets in the bargain—smart lads those
guys are, I’m tellin’ you, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>No doubt Jack was glad to hear this bit of
news, for it had filled him with horror to realize
that in order to escape they had been compelled
to ruthlessly take human life. He was
much younger than Perk, veteran of the World
War, who had grown more or less hardened
to such happenings when staking his own life
against that of a tricky German air pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Still goin’ down, are you?” asked Perk shortly
afterwards, on finding that they were still
swinging around in a wide circle, that burning
pyre far below being the hub of the wheel of
which their boat was the outer tire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Might as well,” came the ready answer,
showing that Jack had made up his mind
hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess now they’ll get down somehow, boss;
a whole lot depends on what kind o’ landin’
they’ll be able to make—if its rocks, or trees,
they got to strike it’s apt to be some hard sleddin’
for the boys. Say, ’taint possible now you’re
fixin’ to try an’ lend ’em a helpin’ hand? I’d
hate to know they’d been wiped off the map in
that hot fire; but somehow I don’t feel like
playin’ the part o’ the Good Samaritan to such
man devils as them two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No danger of my trying to make a landing
where the chances are ten to one it just <i>can’t</i> be
done,” explained Jack, seeing that his companion
was almost ready to mutiny if any such mad
proceeding were contemplated. “I’d just feel
better if I knew they’d reached ground okay;
then we could keep on our way, and it’d be up
to them to get out of the scrape.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! I get you, partner,” grunted the relieved
Perk. “Don’t think I’m bitter about the
thing, ’cause they’re sure hot stuff all right; but
I’m a bit slow to accept that forgive and forget
stuff, specially after any guy’s tried his level
best to gimme a dirty deal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll try the thing out while on the job,”
Jack announced. “Our own wonderful escape
from meeting just that same kind of fate makes
me kind of soft. Perhaps we’ll not be able to
learn a single thing; you know how it often is
when you’ve finally struck ground after quitting
the ship by the chute route—all out of breath—sometimes
knocked up a bit, if you escape broken
bones—not any shape to shout, or do anything
but just lie there, and suck in the air in big
gasps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, that’s right for you, old hoss,” Perk
readily agreed. “Me, I once got a collar bone
smashed that way. No harm in our makin’ a
few swings around these diggin’s ’fore we put
out for Orleans. That fire keeps burnin’ like
things they got sprinkled right well with the
juice when the tank blew up. Go to it, Jack,
just as you please, never mindin’ a few squeals
from a hard-boiled guy like Perk Perkiser.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m going to shut down on the engine, and
take a little glide, so we can pick up anything
like a yell,” announced the pilot a minute later.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to it—duck then, boy!” snapped Perk,
as he temporarily relieved himself of his ear-phones
in order to catch anything bordering on
a shout from the ground below.</p>

<p class='c013'>The simple expedient was carried out successfully,
and when once again they leveled out,
to continue circling, Jack asked eagerly:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get anything, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a bleat, partner,” replied the other, who
had hurriedly held his earphones in position so
as to cover the emergency.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sorry for that, but we’ll try a couple more
times before calling it all off,” suggested Jack,
who could be more or less persistent when the
occasion arose for such action, though never
carrying it so far as to be reckless.</p>

<p class='c013'>So a dozen seconds or so afterwards he again
gave warning that it was time for another drop
of a few hundred feet—not that they meant to
take any chances by getting too close to the unknown
terrain lying in the pitch blackness under
the flying ship; but simply to be able to listen
with the horrid clamor of the bustling engine
momentarily stilled.</p>

<p class='c013'>No better success followed this second maneuvre—all
was deathly silent around, above,
below, as though never a solitary living human
being existed within miles of the spot where
the destruction of the Ryan monoplane had
taken place.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll give a third and last try,” was Jack’s
announced decision, to which Perk added:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Three times, and batter’s out—by then I rather
guess we’ll be down close enough to the solid
ground to make another drop dangerous. Either
way I’m satisfied we’ve done the right thing,
old hoss. Suit yourself when you see fit to
coast,” whereupon he once more denuded his
ears of the exceedingly useful and really indispensable
phone harness, to await the occasion
of the last try in the line of an aviator’s
duty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it, Perk?—get a whisper?”</p>

<p class='c013'>They had completed the glide, and were once
more on a level course, with Jack even turning
the nose of the ship a bit heavenward; since
neither of them knew what the nature of the
ground below must be—whether some hill lay
directly ahead, against which they might smash
for a complete wipeout.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! a heap more’n that, partner!” came
the triumphant reply. “Heard a shout, an’ then
another some distance off—struck me both
jumpers had lit okay, and were tryin’ to communicate,
so’s to get together again. Guess
things ain’t so bad after all with them guys, an’
we c’n be movin’ on our way without botherin’
any more ’bout their safety. Some two-legged
varmints seem to be watched over by Old Satan
hisself, they bein’ that venomous, and evil-minded.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack made no rejoinder to this remark, tinged
with bitterness as it was, only pointed the nose
of his craft upward, and started to spiral for
altitude. Undoubtedly he was feeling greatly
relieved because of their having escaped so
miraculously from the hovering peril; and best
of all managed to turn the tables on those who
would have encompassed their destruction just
in order to defend the lawless game in which
they were engaged in connection with Slippery
Slim.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk must have been doing a little hard thinking
as the time passed and they raced on their
way, for later on he started to speak; and as
usual his line of chatter told that he was seeking
information, trying to find a solution of
certain exasperating puzzles that were “twisting
his intellects,” as he himself described
matters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Things kind o’ got me goofy, partner, an’
I’d like you to raise the curtain some, if so be
you feel so bent. First place I guess it goes
without questionin’ that these huskies must be
in cohunks with that there big gun, Slippery
Slim Garrabrant?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! that’s a dead certainty—who else would
have any reason for waylaying us in Atlanta,
and setting up this trap for us to fall into?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! then it stands to reason, boss, he’s
got means for findin’ out what the Secret Service
aims to do; an’ so has been able to play the boys
for suckers every time they set out to lay him
by the heels, eh, Jack, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s past history, Perk; even the Big Boss
got wise to it, and tried everything possible to
learn where the great leak happened; but our
experience proves they haven’t discovered it so
far. I’m making up my mind that the closer
we draw to the headquarters of this rotten clique
of crime, where they make the bogus long-green
that’s been flooding the whole West for a year
and more, why, the harder our job is bound
to be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which tickles me a heap, boy—I’m just
yearnin’ for comin’ to grips with that gazaboo
o’ a Slim; and now we’re on to the job I’ll never
be happy ’till he’s on his way to that big Government
pen we glimpsed in Atlanta, where
some other lads we helped to pinch are doin’
time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if you keep on as you’ve started, Perk,
we’ll flatten the whole gang like pancakes—they’ve
stacked up against a new sort of revenue
dog when they started a shooter of your calibre
on the trail. First you smashed their searchlight,
and then sent a chuck of lead into the
gas tank that broke up the game. That’s the
kind of a pinch hitter you are, partner; and
right now I want to congratulate you on such
dandy marksmanship.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lay off that stuff, Jack—nothin’ but great
luck fetched the bacon home for this lad. But
me, I’m shakin’ hands with myself ’cause I
had that hunch a bear gun mightn’t be such a
bad thing to tote along on a trip that’s goin’ to
carry us across the border, an’ into Old Mex,
like as not; where the greasers are sometimes
tough nuts an’ hard to handle they tell me.
’Spose we’ll run across them two hill billies
again, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wouldn’t surprise me a bit if we did,” replied
the pilot, leveling off at a three thousand
foot ceiling, and still heading due southwest.
“Like as not they’ve got plenty of ready cash
along; and after having been so cleverly upset in
their calculations, due to your beating them silly
with a barrage of hot lead, they’ll be hot to wipe
out their disgrace. Oh! yes, we’re going to run
up against that foxey pair again before the book
is closed for keeps.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c014'>CHAPTER VII <br /> <br />STRIKING THE FOG BELT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>With the stars shining brightly above them,
and a moon just past its full climbing the eastern
heavens, having dissipated the darkness of the
earlier part of the night, Jack and his fellow
voyager continued plunging along in a very
satisfactory fashion, having no reason for feeling
further concern regarding the peril to
which they had been so lately subjected.</p>

<p class='c013'>But things were not destined to continue so
comfortably for the two adventurers, it seemed.
Perk was just congratulating himself for about
the fourth time at having such a comfortable
flight, when he sat up and took notice of the
fact that those heavenly bodies were beginning
to look exceedingly hazy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Danged shame, that’s what, to spoil such a
dandy night!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What ails you now?” demanded Jack, on
hearing the other make this little remark that
bespoke exasperation at least; “another boat on
our tail?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I guess not just now,” replied Perk,
scoffingly; “one was more’n enough for a single
jump. But we’re agoin’ to run into a pesky
fog belt, sure as you’re born, old hoss!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That all?” laughed the other, who apparently
saw nothing of particular consequence
about such a common happening; “it may perhaps
manage to slow us down more or less; but
what does that matter, when we’ve got time to
burn. The Big Boss told us, remember, not to
hurry things at all—plenty of time, oodles of
money, and any backing we chose to call for in
the way of a new boat, or more helpers. We
should worry, old scout!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Tain’t that in peticular Jack,” complained
the other; “but of all things a sky detective’s got
to run smack up against, fog’s the one I despise
most. It’s got me in bad more’n a few times, so
I’ve grown to look on the peasoup stuff like it
was my—er, what-dye-call it—Nebraska, no, I
mean Nemesis.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, now you mention it, Perk, I remember
you telling me something about that strange feeling
you have creep over you. No need for you
to apologize—in my knocking around among airmen
I’ve found that often even the most daring
and reckless in the bunch had some kind of a
weakness, if only you looked far enough under
the surface; just as sometimes you’ll find a boasting
bully actually afraid of his little wife at
home, who’s smacked him with her handy rolling
pin many a time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! wasn’t I a canvas man ’long with a
travelin’ circus a wheen o’ years ago, an’ didn’t
I see the biggest elephant in captivity rear up
on his hind legs, lift his trunk sky-high in the
air, an’ squeal like fun just when a little half
grown mouse happened to run along near his
alley. Well, I’m the tusker, an’ fog is the
mouse, as you might say—we never do get on
well as a combine. Hope it hugs the ground,
an’ leaves us a clear track up among the clouds
I c’n see creepin’ up ahead yonder.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Doesn’t bother me a whit, partner; don’t
forget we’ve got that new radio beacon aboard
to try out; and if it’s as clever as I’ve heard tell
it’ll carry us along our route to Orleans through
the thickest nest of fog anybody ever stacked up
against. Naturally we can’t expect to get the
full benefit of its capacity to hold a speeding
plane on its true course; because the invention’s
hardly more than half baked up to now; but I
set it according to directions, and if at any time
we begin to slide off our course the light that
springs up is bound to give warning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A bully good layout I’d say, if it c’n do what
they claim,” ventured Perk, who undoubtedly
had read certain things concerning the new invention,
and was eager to learn just how it would
pan out. “You showed a level head, partner,
when you decided to take the offer o’ that gent
in Atlanta, and try the thing out. Guess, then,
I needn’t bother my head ’bout gettin’ astray;
if things keep bein’ invented it ain’t goin’ to be
very long till a pilot’ll get slapped good an’
hard if he misses runnin’ on a straight line, or
even veers from his proper course in a great big
blow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re living in a machine age, Perk, and
every day things are heading that way on the
run—electric helps in kitchen, factory, and even
aboard our air cruisers. While the brainwork
and strain grow harder the actual manual labor
is lessened all the time. But as you say it’s getting
a bit hazy, and chances are we’re in for a
spell of blue fog.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Ten minutes afterwards there could not be
the least doubt concerning that fact, for by degrees
even the stars vanished from view, ditto
the gorgeous round moon. Still, since the sky
remained brighter in the east, it was not at all
difficult to tell where the fair mistress of the
Southern night had hidden her face behind the
opaque veil.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was now flying by instruments alone,
since never a thing could be seen by the keenest
eye above, below—they seemed to be hung in
unlimited space; but pushing along with considerable
speed just the same, bound for the distant
city on the vast Mississippi, situated not so
very far from its delta.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus passed a full hour.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly Perk saw a small light spring into
view on one side of the plane, and it certainly
electrified him considerably.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hi! there, partner, we’re off our track—shifted
to the east, seems like, unless I’m away
wrong in sizin’ things up ’cordin’ to Hoyle.
Got to swing her to the larboard-watch side, I
kinder guess—how ’bout that, boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You hit it that time, Perk, and here she goes
to climb back to our true course. Worked just
as we figured it would, and put us wise to a fact
we’d hardly have picked up in any other way.
I reckon now this same radio beacon’s bound to
turn out a great help to the poor badgered air
pilot, flying blind when fog hides the ground
beacons, and he gets no aid from the heavens
above.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll say it’s the best thing I’ve struck for a
long time,” affirmed the delighted Perk.
“There she goes—the glim I mean—closed shop,
havin’ ’complished the business set for her;
showing we must have struck our real course
again.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Easy money,” laughed Jack, just as well satisfied.
“Makes a fellow sit up and try to guess
what the next big idea connected with aviation
will prove to be; doesn’t seem to be any limit to
the dazzling discoveries these scientific chaps’ll
turn out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, partner—like that big chute they’re
trying out, which they claim will keep any
plane from crashing—if the engine goes dead
all you got to do is to press a little button, and
when the drop comes open goes the monster umbrella,
able to hold you and the crate suspended
in the air, to gradually fall to the earth like the
colored balls from a bursted skyrocket. Great
stunt that, an’ I’m livin’ in hopes it’ll be my
luck to some day find myself aboard a ship that’s
equipped with such a giant chute, an’ have the
glorious experience of seeing the thing work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack seemed to consider it the part of wisdom
to pull up more or less, as they were in no hurry,
and could drop down on the aviation field at
New Orleans by dawn, even though they concluded
to just “loaf along.” Disliking anything
pertaining to fog Perk naturally said nothing
to hint at a desire for further speed; besides
his own good sense told him that what his mate
had just said with regard to no necessity existing
for haste, was sound logic, and a due regard
for “safety first.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So the time slipped away, with midnight finding
them past the meridian of their projected
flight. Perk had long since subsided and
seemed content to sit there in the double cockpit,
letting his thoughts roam back to the exciting
developments of the earlier night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Years had elapsed since last he watched a
doomed plane writhing and twisting in its death
agonies, with the flames wrapping it in an envelope—a
blazing coffin speeding headlong to a
final crash; and here, strange to say, after all
that time intervening he had again passed
through a similar experience. Now that he had
an opportunity to calmly review the happening,
Perk admitted he was pleased to know the two
occupants of the Ryan cockpit had apparently
escaped a miserable fate that must have been
laid at his door.</p>

<p class='c013'>Two A. M. and all’s well!</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk figured that when a few more times
sixty minutes had passed it would be time for
them to catch a first glimpse of the great rolling
turgid stream that could, when the heavy rains
united with the melting snows up in the mountains
of the Far West, create vast floods that
placed much of the low country along the river
under many feet of water. It had been a long
time since last Perk had set eyes on the Mississippi,
and hence he was considerably worked
up over the prospect of soon glimpsing the
mighty flood.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c014'>CHAPTER VIII <br /> <br />NEW ORLEANS—FIRST STOP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“There she rolls, Jack, old boy—the greatest
stream in the whole U.S.A.—I swan if she
don’t look just as fine as when I glimpsed her
for the first time many years ago!”</p>

<p class='c013'>That was Perk’s tribute on beholding the
Lower Mississippi perhaps thirty miles above
New Orleans; he displayed almost as much enthusiasm
as those early discoverers did centuries
back, when their distended eyes took in the
mighty sweep of the flood rolling down toward
its junction with the Mexican Gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was early dawn, and the fog bank had been
dissipated by a fresh breeze acting as advance
courier to the rising of the sun. Jack, looking
toward the southwest could also see the object
of his companion’s exultation, and undoubtedly
felt some of the same pleasure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When it gets a bit lighter we’ll have a far distant
view of the city, with its smoke cloud hovering
over it,” he remarked, knowing that soft coal
and southern pine as used for fuel in the Fall
and Winter seasons always caused something of
a pall to mark the site of the river metropolis.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk reached around, and drew forth a case
that on being opened disclosed a pair of pretty
decent binoculars, with which they had been
fitted out by the Washington authorities before
starting on this particular man-hunt, with an
idea that they might prove most useful sooner
or later.</p>

<p class='c013'>After clapping these to his eyes Perk announced
that he could easily pick up the goal
of their flight from Candler Field; although the
smoke did act as a screen, through which it was
not possible to see with certainty.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was now bringing out all the reserve
speed of their ship—it was of some consequence
that they make a landing as early as possible,
since he had no desire to attract undue attention,
and possibly have inquisitive newspaper reporters
to be asking pertinent questions as to
whence they came, what their identities might
be when at home, and also concerning the object
of their coming to New Orleans. Secrecy
was the foundation on which they meant to
build their plans; and from their previous experience
with those dare devils in the employ of
Slippery Slim, too much care could not be employed
in order to mask their batteries.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, too, as they approached the city Jack was
dropping down to lower levels; while on his part
Perk skimmed the whole scene, looking for the
airport they knew to be somewhere within reach
of their vision.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being presently located he called his
chum’s attention to the open field, and in almost
no time they were circling it, looking for the
best place to land.</p>

<p class='c013'>Early though it was there were moving figures
circulating around, while some sort of ship
was coming in from over the river—possibly one
of the air mail carriers from a distant station, it
might be many hundred miles away, fetching
Uncle Sam’s important letter sacks, and worthwhile
express matter, at treble the speed that the
fastest train could muster.</p>

<p class='c013'>The landing was effected without the slightest
difficulty, and hardly had their boat come
to a stop than a number of persons, most of them
connected with the ground force of mechanicians
and hostlers, surrounded the incoming
craft, paying but scant attention to the air mail,
which dropped down almost at the same moment—that
was a daily happening, a following
out of a regular schedule, to which they had
become accustomed; while the arrival of a mysterious
plane might stand for almost anything.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold fast, Perk!” said Jack, as he took off
his headphones, and raising his voice to almost
a shout, so deaf did he appear after a whole
night’s run; “don’t tumble out yet; and keep a
muffler on your gab, for we’ve got to let ’em
take it out in guessing. I’ll soon see if the
party we’re expecting to meet is on hand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He still kept his helmet and goggles in position
as he thrust his head out of the cockpit, and
raising his right hand with two fingers extended,
made a species of salute. A stout man,
with a very red face, and an air of importance,
immediately pushed through the gathering
crowd, and answered Jack’s signal with a similar
sweep of his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s okay, Perk—that’s our party, and he’s
been watching for us, showing he had my wire
last evening. Get a move on, and we’ll soon be
doubling our legs under a breakfast table.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! but that will be a joy to me,
old hoss!” Perk exclaimed; “’cause I’m as
hungry as a wolf, an’ the smell o’ coffee is apt
to set me wild. Go to it, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was paying no attention to these vaporings,
since it was a common occurrence to have
old Perk declare the bottom of his stomach was
in danger of falling out—he had met the red-faced
gentleman and they were shaking hands
as they exchanged a few words.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all fixed, comrade,” he said to Perk over
his shoulder, mentioning no names lest suspicious
ears catch them, and thus have a clue as
to their identity; “we’ll get a few of these boys
to run our boat into a hangar close by, which is
waiting for us, and then cut out for the city—and grub.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This being speedily carried out, with the
doors fastened securely, and the two flyers began
to hastily divest themselves of their working
“duds.” Before ten minutes had passed
they were on their way in a taxi the gentleman
friend had brought out, with Jack and their
host talking at a great rate; while as for Perk
he was looking out, and finding more or less enjoyment
in seeing new and novel sights along
the road.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk having been well coached as to the
necessity for caution, made it a practice to snatch
an occasional glance in their rear, looking for
any signs to indicate that their car was being
trailed; but nothing at all suspicious came to
his attention.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meantime Jack had learned that their new
friend (whose name he already knew to be Mr.
Adkins) was connected with the Administration
forces of the United States District Attorney,
having offices in the Government building—that
he had been secretly advised of their coming
days before receiving Jack’s wire; and was
ready to give them all the information possible
concerning what had been learned in connection
with the wholesale operations of the man they
had been sent out to cage, so as to effectually
remove the greatest menace that had threatened
business men of the Southwest in a decade.</p>

<p class='c013'>In due time he would post them regarding
all these important facts; meanwhile they
could take things easy, for there was no hurry,
and the game was of too much importance to
allow lax methods. When they got good and
ready they could make a start, and after that
everything must depend on their ability to beat
Slippery Slim at his favorite game of “dog eat
dog.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He steered his guests to a certain restaurant
where he knew they could be well taken care
of, and which turned out to be close to the hotel
at which they booked under fictitious names.
Here Perk was given the privilege of ordering
just what he desired along the line of rashers of
bacon and fried eggs; cornbread with syrup;
several cups of coffee taken black; and to top off
with, a Havana cigar such as he was not accustomed
to smoking, being addicted to the more
friendly pipe habit.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no talk of shop while they partook
of breakfast; such business as they had to transact
was of too delicate a nature to be discussed
in a public place, where strangers would be
coming and going, and spying eyes might be on
them every minute of the time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Later they gathered in the room at the hotel
where, behind closed and locked doors they felt
free to confer in lowered tones.</p>

<p class='c013'>Much had to be told, and numerous thrilling
accounts brought out connected with adventures
experienced by other Secret Service men in their
efforts to round up the notorious gang—all of
which had resulted in absolute defeat for the
Government agents.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shrewd men some of these parties undoubtedly
were, with a record of numerous famous
cases successfully carried through; but somehow
when they found themselves up against
Slippery Slim Garrabrant they sooner or later
fell down on the job, and had to be recalled.</p>

<p class='c013'>In fact, it was disclosed to Jack and his pal,
two different agents were never again heard
from, after secret code messages had been received
from them to the effect that they were
even then getting very close to a great discovery
that must end in the arrest of the malefactor—a
dead silence that had never been broken
seemed to signify that they must have fallen into
some sort of fiendish trap, possibly meeting with
a gruesome fate that would be forever shrouded
in blank mystery.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins, watching closely as he narrated
these uncomfortable facts, was pleased to see
that neither of his interested auditors displayed
the least sign of being disturbed, showing that
they had long since discounted everything along
this line.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c014'>CHAPTER IX <br /> <br />COACHING PERK</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Of course it was in keeping with this exchange
of confidences that Jack should relate all that
had happened to them since their arrival in
Atlanta to secure the ship awaiting them, load
it to capacity for a long voyage, and finally start
off from Candler Field.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins listened eagerly to this modest
account of what had already happened to them
as a starter in the hunt they had undertaken;
and he was visibly thrilled at hearing of the
bitter night chase, the desperate tactics undertaken
by the pair of human wolves aboard the
Ryan monoplane; and particularly when Jack
finally described in vivid language the astounding
act of Perk in first shattering the bothersome
searchlight, to follow this with his lucky
random shot that bore into the gas tank of the
pursuing craft and brought about an explosion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Possibly the urbane gentleman had never in
all his life listened to so ghastly a true story as
the graphic one thus modestly related by one
of the two participants; looking at them, with
Jack so calm and modest, giving all the credit
to his grinning accomplice, he must have decided
in his astute mind that at last Slippery
Slim was going to have a pair of human bloodhounds
on his trail such as all his ingenuity and
vindictiveness combined could not throw into
the discard.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me have,” he went on to say to Jack, “as
good a description as possible of those same
bills your friend Scotty found in that pocketbook
dropped among his clothing by the unknown
party whom you believe was looking for
your letter of instructions from Washington.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When Jack complied with this request the
other nodded his head approvingly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question but what they were of the same
stripe as all the others that have been brought to
our attention,” he told Jack. “You must know
it’s been a mooted question as to whether the
plates from which these notes are being printed
in vast quantities (that make it a gold mine for
the gang) are counterfeits engraved by some
master in the art or stolen property, which have
somehow never been missed by the plant where
much of the printing is done for the Treasury
Department—the bills are so perfect that cashiers
and tellers are all at sea over the facts, so
that something of a near panic has resulted in
banking circles as a result of this unknown quantity.
Remember these are the old type of banknotes,
and not the new abbreviated form of currency,
so that it is more difficult to discover the
actual facts.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will all come out in the wash, sir,” remarked
Perk, sagaciously, with a sly wink at
his pal.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, Perk,” observed the gentlemanly official,
smilingly; “but I’m more concerned about
your plan of campaign than anything else right
now. During the time you stop over here in
Orleans I mean to keep you posted with regard
to any fresh news that comes in to Headquarters
for there is hardly a day when we do not learn
of additional discoveries connected with this deluge
of phony money that’s been dumped on the
whole Southwest by this hard working gang.
I am telling you everything that’s known or suspected,
so that you can figure out your best line
of action.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We understand that, Mr. Adkins,” said Jack,
nodding, “and you can rest assured we appreciate
your kindness more than I can tell you.
Before we jump off you will know what we’ve
decided to do, so as to pick up a warm trail;
and after that, sir, don’t be worried if you fail
to hear a single word from us for days, weeks,
or even months; but depend upon it we’ll be
working on the job every minute.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And never forget, I beg of you, that this
man is a devil for cruelty and craftiness—I’m
sure you’ll not delude yourselves that his arrest
will be an easy task; for as good men as were
ever on the roll of our Secret Service Department
have fallen down on the job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you again, sir, for your warning; but
we’re not meaning to feel anything like over-confidence,
so as to let the bars down. I understand
from my having been picked to take up
this case, that the knowledge of myself and my
assistant here along the line of aviation cut a big
figure in the appointment, since it has been
learned that Slim himself makes use of a flying
boat possibly to cross over from the wilds of
Mexico, it being suspected he has his plant
hidden away somewhere among the mountains,
where he doubtless keeps peace with the authorities
by paying tribute that insures his being left
undisturbed. We hope to change all that sooner
or later, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I admire your modesty, Jack,” continued the
Government official, who had warmed toward
the pair during the short time he had known
them, and seemed to take a personal interest in
their fortunes. “Remember to keep in touch
with Headquarters while in the city, so as to
notify me in case you need any assistance—I can
later on place a posse of oldtime Texas Rangers
at your service, if the occasion arises for a necessity
to show force—they are now working for
the Government as border patrols, and as you
can understand, are the same rough-riding, fearless
type that played such a leading figure in
the early history of the Lone Star State; for we
have authority that covers such matters. And
I’ll be one of the first to extend you my hearty
congratulations should you win out, and bring
in your man; as I’ve no doubt your good pal
here used to do when, as you’ve told me, he used
to work with the Canadian Mounted Police
force, in years gone by.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It won’t be our fault, sir, if we make a flop
o’ the job,” asserted Perk, who believed he ought
to get in an occasional word; although there
were a good many things he did not wholly
understand, and which he would depend on
Jack to further explain when opportunity arose.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins shook them both cordially by the
hand, and took his departure, leaving them to
digest all the startling facts he had placed in
their possession. By slow degrees they would
figure things out, and sketch their plan of operation;
then would come the hour when once more
they must depend on their wings to carry them
many hundreds of miles toward the scene of
action, where the air would be surcharged with
dynamite, while deadly enemies might be lying
in ambush, ready to take them by surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk started to spring his questions, and Jack
was only too glad to make the necessary explanations;
for it was necessary that they work in
complete harmony if they hoped to be successful.</p>

<p class='c013'>As far as they had gone, things looked hopeful
to Jack, as he marshalled the facts that had
lately been placed in their possession. He was
satisfied that when every item had been arranged
in its rightful sequence they could fashion a
plan of campaign that would at least have a
better chance for winning out than any of those
utilized by former detectives, who had not possessed
the essential wings so as to meet Slippery
Slim on his own chosen ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No tellin’ just how long we’ll stick it out in
this burgh, I guess, buddy?” suggested Perk,
some time later, as they continued to take things
easy, resting up after a hard night’s flight, and
meaning to get around the city after noon and
lunch time had come and passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Couldn’t say as yet, Perk; we’ve got to comb
out the stuff as handed over by our new friend,
Mr. Adkins, and discard everything that doesn’t
pan out as being worth while. Then there were
a few leaders he dropped that, if followed up,
might turn out to be leading clues, the possession
of which would possibly turn the tide of battle.
I’m meaning not to let anything make me show
undue speed—Rome wasn’t built in a day, we’ve
got to recollect, and so shape things from the
standpoint of ‘safety first’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! that’s the boy!” gurgled the pleased
Perk; “me, don’t I remember that story o’ the
hare an’ the tortoise runnin’ a race, which the
turtle won ’cause he never even stopped to rest
up; while the rabbit, thinkin’ he could run loops
around such a plodder, lay down to take a nap,
overslept himself, and when he got to the goal
there was Old Leatherback awaitin’ to turn the
big laugh on him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk wound up with one of his rollicking
laughs; everything seemed to create merriment
in his soul just now, after that royal breakfast;
though perhaps he was running away ahead of
the dry facts, and counting his chickens before
they were hatched out of the shell. But Perk
was confident the sly fox of a Slim would find
himself snagged in the net one of these days,
and the clever guy who handled things would
turn out to be an aviator and sky detective named
Jack Ralston.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack some time afterwards, had just aroused
from a short nap, when Perk, who had been
pondering and grumbling to himself, tossed out
another question, as if to disclose what was
troubling him:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it, old hoss, do you b’lieve them
dicks we left behind after they’d floated down
from a high ceilin’ with their chutes, got outen
the scrape, so they could a hiked to some nearby
village or town, an’ took the first train headed
for Orleans, reckonin’ we must a’been on the
jump thisaways?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say the chances all point that way, Perk,”
Jack told him, without the slightest hesitation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jumpin’ crickets! if that’s a fact why, a feller
might run acrost the slick pair any old minute—meet
’em right face to face!” Perk went on to
say, as if the fact gave him more or less concern.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose then you’d recognize the chappies
with just one look, eh, what about that, partner?”
asked Jack, laughingly; at which the other
grinned a bit foolishly, to admit he had serious
doubts on that score.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! didn’t either o’ us get a peep-in at
their monikers, worse luck—had them helmets
and goggles in place right away, like they didn’t
mean to give us a single look-in. S’pose now
they got the high sign on us boys?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“On a venture I’d say that was always possible,”
replied Jack, soberly; for this very point
had occurred to him, and was as yet unsettled
in his mind. “Nobody knows how long they may
have been in Atlanta—Mr. Adkins assured us
Slim seemed to have all sorts of strings out, so
as to learn in advance of any bunch of Government
agents taking the field against his giant
bogus money monopoly; and for all we can tell
those two may have been spying on us most
of the time we were around Candler Field, getting
our ship ready to take to the air.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rotten luck, I’m sayin’, and too much one-sided
to suit me,” growled Perk, frowning savagely.
“Here we got to do our work in the
dark; while that smart cuss holds all the high
cards in the pack, an’ c’n trump our ace any
time he takes a notion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No need to worry about that, comrade,” said
Jack, soothingly. “You must remember that
when we move along we mean to disappear as
if heading into the thickest belt of pea soup fog
ever seen—in that way they’ll lose all trace of
us, and we can play our cards as we choose, making
up for a different breed of sky travelers, so
as to dope the cleverest kind of spies he can send
out. While they’re left guessing what’s become
of us we’ll be doing our little tracking job, and
hour by hour, day after day, keep on creeping
closer to their secret stronghold, wherever that
may prove to be. Those are some of the things
we figured on doing, Perk, don’t forget.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The one addressed made no reply, but as he
let his head fall back, as if he meant to pick up
a few winks of sleep, there came a look of rapt
admiration on his weather-beaten face that bespoke
the utmost confidence in his best pal.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c014'>CHAPTER X <br /> <br />LAYING PLANS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>After a noonday lunch Jack and his partner
spent most of the afternoon in carrying out the
various duties that were seemingly on their program.
Among other things Jack visited the
Federal building, and was closeted for more
than an hour with Mr. Adkins.</p>

<p class='c013'>The latter official had conceived a great fancy
for young Ralston, and went to no end of trouble
so as to post him with regard to what he was
likely to run up against while endeavoring to
close in on Slippery Slim. With his accustomed
sagacity Jack made notes of some of the
facts thus laid before him; but since these were
in shorthand, and would be utterly unintelligible
to any outside party, should they chance
to fall into enemy hands, there was no danger
that any mischief would follow.</p>

<p class='c013'>By degrees he was filling up with scraps of
description, and everything connected with
former attempts at locating the hideout, where
all this unlawful scrip was being turned off the
press, to flood the Southwest.</p>

<p class='c013'>That was always his way of doing—when
given a tough job Jack would live alongside it,
breathing the very atmosphere of the undertaking,
until he found himself sympathetic with the
aims and ambitions of the criminals whose apprehension
was placed on his shoulders by his
Big Boss.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll have dinner early, Perk,” he told the
other, who had been carrying out a number of
special duties while Jack was busy elsewhere,
“so as to retire to our room at the hotel. No
going out after nightfall for us just at present,
especially in a strange city, where some sneak
might waylay us coming back from the theater.
All that sort of pleasure must be put out of our
heads just at present.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! guess you’re hittin’ the nail on the
head, old hoss, when you say that,” grunted
Perk, who very probably had already picked out
just the screen play he wanted so badly to see;
but he was a good scout, and able to put duty
above pleasure, when the occasion arose for
making a personal sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another thing,” continued Jack, “there’s no
telling what night flying we’re bound to be up
against, in trying to keep our movements secret;
so it’d be wise for us both to enjoy all the extra
sleep that comes our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, partner,” assented Perk, subordinating
his desires to the slogan which he knew
was Jack’s watchword—“safety first”. “When
I’ve stowed away all the grub I c’n hold mebbe
I’ll be ready to hit the hay, to stick it out till
cock-crow around daylight—an’ then some.
Pretty fair sleeper, they always called me across
the big pond—crawl out as the last horn was
blowin’, rub my eyes a bit, get aboard my fightin’
crate, an’ step off to knock another Heine pilot
down afore botherin’ ’bout my breakfast—all in a
day’s doings with Gabe Perkiser. Sabbe that,
partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I know you like a book,” Jack told him
with a smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get a bellyfull when you had that confab
with Mr. Adkins?” demanded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m filled up to the brim with all kinds of
material, which by degrees I’ll have to sort out,
keeping only what strikes me as essential,” came
the answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see—sorter separatin’ the chaff from the
wheat,” mused Perk; “an’ if it’s a fair question,
old hoss, which way do we head when we take
off?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You might call it due northeast,” Jack told
him; and then, as his companion uttered a
startled exclamation, as though vastly surprised,
Jack gave a quick glance around as if to make
certain that no one was dogging their footsteps,
after which he lowered his voice almost to a
whisper, to add: “but that would be only for a
<i>blind</i>, in case hostile eyes were watching our
departure from the flying field; for after we’ve
cleared a dozen or more miles we can make a
complete circle, and point the nose of our boat
squarely west!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good boy!” snapped the relieved Perk;
“sounds a heap more like it. You sure did
throw a big scare into me, Jack, ’cause it’d been
’bout settled ’tween us that the game had ought
to be played out there in the boundless waste
spaces around the border.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, everything points that way so far,” he
was assured; “but no more talkie at present,
Perk—we’ll keep bottled up until inside four
walls, where no spy can steal our thunder.
Slim’s knocked the underpinning away from a
bunch of fine schemes looking to his undoing,
simply by finding out what the big game happened
to be, and then bursting the bubble by a
scoop. We don’t intend to dish our business
that way if it can be helped.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wall,” drawled Perk, with his best Yankee
effect, “guess not if we know our stuff, an’ c’n
roll our hoop.”</p>

<p class='c013'>As they walked along toward their hotel Perk
kept up a constant lookout, as though endeavoring
to make some more or less thrilling discovery—never
a man, black or white, did they meet
but that he was made the object of a severe
scrutiny by the suspicious one; however, they
reached their objective without his having run
across any reason for making a decision; and
shortly afterwards they were securely lodged in
their room, the door locked, and a couple of easy
chairs inviting them to take things comfortable,
which they lost no time in doing, being wearied
from so much trotting about—flying men as a
rule not enjoying a reputation for pedestrian
feats.</p>

<p class='c013'>A long and serious confab followed, both
speaking in low tones; Jack on his part explained
the mass of information he had accumulated,
and answered the flood of questions asked
by his comrade, as well as he was able; until he
found a chance to go deeper into things himself
he could not make definite statements concerning
a number of points that were a bit hazy, and
needed confirmation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus the afternoon waned, and the time came
when they were ready to think of the essential
“eats”. Of course it was Perk who brought this
subject up, for he chanced to have a tremendous
appetite, and was apt to give considerable time
to figuring what his next <i>menu</i> would be—indeed,
half the enjoyment in his estimation lay in
thus building air castles along the line of “grub”.</p>

<p class='c013'>Remembering that little episode up in Atlanta,
where some unknown party had made such
a “rat’s nest” of Scotty’s adjoining room, evidently
under a mistaken belief it belonged to
himself and Perk, Jack made sure to carry all
his important papers on his person, properly secured,
so that no deft hand of a sneak thief could
negotiate their abstraction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All ready, partner,” he told Perk, at the time
looking out of the window, holding back the
curtains to see the better who chanced to be
walking along the opposite pavement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never said sweeter words than them, old
boy; I sure was close to faintin’, my tummy
feelin’ like the bottom was adroppin’ out—soup
an’ such soft stuffs, while fillin’ at the time don’t
stay with me any great while—I crave solids
mostly. On your way then, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had marshalled all the facts that had
been placed in his possession, weeded a few out
as worthless, and by the time their discussion
ended had told his companion that the Finger
of Destiny was pointing out their future course
as lying over the almost boundless plains of
Texas, across New Mexico, and deep into Arizona
deserts, to the wild country along the border
not far distant from the spot at which the
Gila river forms a junction with the larger Colorado;
where the latter serves as a watery boundary
line between Arizona and Southeastern California,
with Old Mexico less than thirty miles
distant as the crow flies.</p>

<p class='c013'>It would be a big jump for them, but the flood
of bad currency undoubtedly had its start somewhere
in this hostile region, and spread out like
an open fan, northwest into San Diego and Los
Angeles—northward up to Salt Lake City—and
in the northeast as far as Oklahoma. To
effectually break it up it was necessary that they
go to the fountain head, so as to destroy the very
roots of the noisome poison ivy plant.</p>

<p class='c013'>They spent more than half an hour dining,
and needless to say Perk enjoyed himself to his
heart’s content—who wouldn’t if he had a pocketfull
of ready cash, furnished by a bountiful
Uncle Sam; a bill of fare bristling with all kinds
of tempting dishes such as Perk doted on; and
to complete the combination having been born
with a healthy, unbridled appetite?</p>

<p class='c013'>It was just commencing to get dusk when they
emerged from the restaurant and started back to
the hotel, some two blocks distant. Perk, as
usual, kept turning his head this way and that
very much like a wolf scalp-hunter looking for
his suspicious quarry. Presently he picked at
Jack’s sleeve, and bending his head until his lips
almost touched the other’s ear he observed in a
sibilant whisper!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen, partner—we got a clam doggin’ us
like a bloodhound on the track o’ a runaway nigger
from a convict camp back in Alabam—get
that, do you?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c014'>CHAPTER XI <br /> <br />THE NIGHT ALARM</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“I’m not thrilled by what you say, Perk, because
I’ve been more than half expecting to hear
that discovery. Glad you got on to him okay;
because it’s always best to know what’s in the
wind. What sort of a chap is he like?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack spoke in his usual calm way, and the other
realized he had undoubtedly been prepared for
the sudden news.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ out o’ the way ’bout his looks, far as
I c’n see,” was Perk’s reply; “on’y got a few
squints at the guy; but he’s keepin’ tab o’ our
movements I guess now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Reckon he might be one of those lads in the
Ryan ship that crashed in flames after they’d
flown the coop?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! just can’t be dead sure, partner,”
chuckled Perk; “but there’s somethin’ ’bout his
walk that gets me into believin’ he’s the <i>kiwi</i>
that pilot was keepin’ on our tail so long, stickin’
like a leech from a mud-hole.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder,” the other went on to say, as if
talking to himself; “if that’s the case then, both
those duffers pulled through with their lives, and
not so badly hurt. Honestly I’m a bit glad that’s
so, for up to the present I’ve never had occasion
to take a human life.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk snorted on hearing this.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if so be you’d been ten years older, my
boy, mebbe you’d not be able to say that—chances
are you’d a been mixed up in that mess across the
Atlantic, when Yanks an’ Johnny Rebs were
fightin’ shoulder to shoulder, and it was a case o’
a Heine pilot’s life or our’n. But if you keep
on with Uncle Sam’s service as you’re adoin’
right now, the time’ll come for you to fetch back
a dead man who jest <i>wouldn’t</i> let hisself be captured.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like as not,” remarked Jack; “but there’s no
need of crossing a river till you come to it; so
I’m not taking trouble by the forelock away
ahead of time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’ll we do ’bout this dickey bird that’s
bobbin’ at our heels so gaily, tell me, partner?”
pursued Perk, eagerly, as though in his fighting
heart he was actually hoping his superior would
give the order to turn on their persistent pursuer,
and at least blacken both his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! nothing at all, Perk; let him run his
rope; only we’ll keep along streets where there’s
plenty of company, and be prepared for any sort
of ambush; though I can’t believe he’d be crazy
enough to start anything so early in the evening—if
the hour was close to midnight, things
might be different. There are any number of
tough cases in this old Creole city ready to handle
a sticking game for the coin in it—blacks and
yellows and whites it doesn’t matter which—all
of them are assassins at heart.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then you don’t care if he shadows us straight
to the hotel?” demanded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Much good that will do him.” said Jack with
a light laugh; “the chances are two to one he
already knows where we’ve put up, and has had
some spy dog me to the Federal building. When
the time comes for us to jump off we’ll find a
slick way to hop our ship without giving these
boys a show-down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently they arrived at the hotel entrance,
without any untoward incident arising to mar
the quiet of the evening. Perk cast a parting
glance toward their rear just before entering,
and seeing the shadowy figure hovering not far
away, considered it a part of his duty to place
his thumb to his nose, and wiggle his fingers
derisively, at the same time uttering a snarl like
a bobcat at bay, to express his utter contempt.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once in their room, Jack first of all cast about
as if to decide whether any uninvited guest had
intruded on their preserves while they were absent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything seems to be just as we left it,”
he told his running mate, after making this little
survey, “and even if some busybody did get in
here with the aid of a pass-key borrowed from a
chambermaid, he was shrewd enough not to mess
things up like they did with our friend Scotty
of the air mail bunch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess now they must acome to the conclusion
you keep the letter o’ instructions ’bout your
person,” suggested Perk, wisely, “which, bein’
the case mebbe now they figger on sneakin’ in
here while we’re sound asleep, an’ agoin’ through
your clothes in regulation style. They do tell me
there be sneak thieves right clever in this same
burgh, equal to the ones out in India, where they
c’n steal the sheet from under a sleeper, without
wakin’ him up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I understand that’s really true, partner,” Jack
agreed; “but we’re not going to let them have
half a chance, even if they hired all the crooks
in New Orleans to play the game.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sounds good to me, boss,” Perk declared.
“We’ll manage to sleep with one eye open, an’
if any critter tries to give us the once over, he’ll
wish he’d never been born, that’s all I know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Before turning in, Jack placed a chair so nicely
balanced that in case of the door being ever so
slightly opened it would crash to the floor, making
enough noise to arouse the Seven Sleepers.
Perk grinned at seeing him prepare this “guardian
angel” as he termed it, and lost no time himself
in “hitting the hay.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Some time later in the night, when outside
noises had almost died away, there came a loud
clatter that awoke both the sleepers instantly.
They bounced out on the floor in their pajamas,
with Jack pulling the cord he had attached to
the electric bulb, so that the room was magically
illuminated.</p>

<p class='c013'>The chair lay on its side, and just beyond Perk
could see that their door was partly open; the
key had been left in the lock, but skillful fingers
must have manipulated it by means of
slender-jawed pliers, showing the touch of a professional
thief.</p>

<p class='c013'>Straight toward the door the form of Perk was
projected—a hungry lion could hardly have
made a more pronounced leap at some four-legged
game which he had been stalking.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tearing open the door still wider, Perk thrust
out his head, and looked up and down the hotel
corridor. He fancied he could make out a dim
figure far along the poorly lighted hall, but it
vanished like a phantom even as he stared, evidently
turning some corner.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there were other sounds arising—doors
all along the corridor were opening, and heads
being projected, showing how the startling alarm
had awakened numerous other sleepers, who
may have imagined an earthquake was in process
of occurring, though such a happening was utterly
foreign to the metropolis on the Lower Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c013'>Voices, too, were heard, from both masculine
as well as feminine sources, as the aroused hotel
guests endeavored to fathom the real meaning
of the row.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, seeing there was nothing doing, closed
the door, and locked it again; after which he
turned to his companion who had been watching
his actions with more or less amusement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Consarn his picture,” growled the old fighter;
“he got off scot free; I jest glimpsed him
aturnin’ the first bend down the hall. Blamed
shame I couldn’t come to grips with the yeller
cub—I’d a given a heap to twist his neck
some, you bet I would. Mebbe now I’d otter sit
up the rest o’ the night to make certain, eh,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not the slightest need of such a thing, partner,”
Jack assured him. “I’ll fix that door so it
won’t be opened again in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c013'>With that he again took the stout chair, and
placed it diagonally against the door, so that its
top rested just under the knob; after that had
been accomplished it must needs be a battering-ram
that could burst in on them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not content with that, Jack went to each of
the two windows, thrust out his head to examine
for the second time the face of the outer wall of
the building so as to make sure there was no
ledge wide enough to give a would-be trespasser
foothold.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not the ghost of a chance for the most nimble
thief to get in by way of a window, Perk, so
back to bed we go, and sleep like babes in the
wood for we’re in the third story and far enough
from a fire escape to be secure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk grinned and nodded acquiescence; truth
to tell he was not at all averse to starting all over
again—possibly the rude interruption had disturbed
him just when he was starting to partake
of a royal feast that covered every one of his most
beloved dishes and he was hugging the delusion
to his heart that if given another chance history
might repeat itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>At least there was no further alarm, and the
night passed into oblivion like all its countless
predecessors with the rising sun arousing the
two comrades, and Perk as usual singing out
that he felt as though he could easily manage two
customary breakfasts in that delighful restaurant
where they were already feeling so much at
home.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c014'>CHAPTER XII <br /> <br />PLAYING WITH FIRE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>During the morning Jack took a taxi and paid
another visit to the offices in the government
building where Mr. Adkins had his desk, doing
his daily stunt under the direction of the U. S.
District Attorney and other officials in the service
of Uncle Sam.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, also, had his job laid out for him, which
was to circulate around until he felt positive he
had thrown off any possible spy after which it
was his duty to make certain purchases, following
the list Jack had given him, have them all
sent to the aviation field in charge of the man
Mr. Adkins had placed on guard at the hangar
containing their ship and thus completing the
stock of supplies necessary for their long flight
and survey work.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk carried out his instructions to the letter,
and with great vim, since the fact of their laying
in these stores was a positive indication that
things were coming to pass insuring a speedy
getaway and <i>Action</i> was what had come to be
the greatest asset in life to Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>They met again at noon in their eating place,
where, choosing an isolated corner table they
could discuss their plan of campaign, even while
attending to the wants of the inner man.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk made his report, which the other seemed
to find good, judging from his frequent nods of
acquiescence and when the story had been told
to the last word, Perk felt it was his turn to
learn things.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess now you got the last batch o’ information
from His Nibs, Jack?” he hastened to
ask, expectantly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sure did, partner,” he was told. “A few
scraps of fresh news that’d be likely to interest
us had drifted in since I saw Mr. Adkins last,
which he passed along to me. I’ll sort these
shreds over later, and fix them where they belong.
So far as I can see now they corroborate
what we’ve already been so strongly believing
must be a fact.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which means, I guess, boss, we head west?”
ventured Perk, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Into the setting sun—that’s right, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do we still expect to keep in touch with Mr.
Adkins, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whenever the chance opens up, and we have
any important news to send along or want to
know certain things, perhaps even to call on him
for that bunch of old-time Texas Rangers he
said he could turn over to us if we found any
use for them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be!” said Perk, plainly excited, “I
sure do hope that emergency does bob up, ’cause
I’d give my last Mex dollar to glimpse them
rearin’, tearin’ ole fighters knockin’ spots outen
the bunch o ’lawless ringers Slippery Slim’s
gathered around him. Chances are they’d skip
out like hot fleas soon as they heard the ol’time
battle cry o’ the defenders o’ the Rio Grande in
the days when cattle rustlers raided the ranches
down Texas way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But we’ve got to remember,” cautioned
Jack, “that these chaps are like lean hungry
wolves, that never leave the trail of a wounded
stag as long as they can crawl along. I’m not
fancying we’ve pulled the wool over their eyes
so far and that fact was brought to my attention
just after I got back from conferring with
Mr. Adkins.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As how, boss?” queried the curious Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t just know what influenced me after
I’d entered the hotel, to step back and look out
again,” explained Jack. “There was the driver
of my taxi, the trusty who’d been recommended
by the clerk at the desk, talking earnestly with
an unknown party and even as I watched I saw
him thrust a bank note into the chauffeur’s itching
hand, showing that he has been corrupted
and is in cohoot with our enemies.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! is it so rotten bad as all that, partner?”
bleated the disgusted Perk, “All I c’n
say is I sure do hope it was a nice brand new five-dollar
bill he handed over to the yeller dog, an’
that it’s agoin’ to turn out to be a sample o’ their
bogus money outfit. Serve the slick renegade if
he got hisself pulled in for passin’ a counterfeit
note on some guy that ain’t goin’ to sit by and
take what’s comin’ to him without raisin’ a nice
howl.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t be too vindictive, Perk,” Jack told
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, partner, ever see the boob afore?” the
other demanded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you mean the chap who was pumping my
driver for all that was out, Perk, I can’t say
that I have. He was a flashily dressed man,
with loud clothes that would stamp him as a
gambler, like those who used to travel on these
Mississippi River steamboats in the old days before
the Civil War, fleecing unsuspecting passengers
out of all their money and I haven’t
the least doubt but what he’s a member of the
very gang we’re expecting to round up. Mr.
Adkins told me it was simply amazing the vastness
of the combine Slippery Slim’s managed to
gather around him but he was certain it must
number many scores of workers, all obeying the
orders of the mainspring—crooked Slim Garrabrant.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! the more you keep on tellin’ me them
big stories, Jack, the happier it all makes me
’cause I seem to just know there’s bound to be a
heap o’ rough house stuff croppin’ up, to cool
my blood, ragin’ hot just now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some fine day you’ll be rubbing up against
enough fighting to make you call quits with the
game. Perk, my boy; and it’s just likely to crop
up before long if indications count for anything.
I felt pretty sure from his swagger that
this fellow might be the very same master mind
in charge of that Ryan boat—then, too, when he
walked away he had a little limp, which might
have come from striking the ground so hard
after his chute let him down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Darned pity he didn’t break a leg, or even
his measly ol’ neck, I’d say,” grumbled Perk, one
of his fits of resentment gripping him just then.
“Got no use for these treacherous snakes that
squirm, and worm their way into the confidence
o’ honest gents, on’y to play a low-down trick,
an’ fill their pockets with smackers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s one thing we’ve got to guard
against,” suggested Jack, who seemed to have a
faculty for looking at every side of a picture,
and anticipating troubles that might never have
occurred to others less gifted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As what, partner?” asked Perk, brightening
up once more.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Delay is what they may be hoping for—some
way to hold us here while important news is
carried to headquarters. I can even see how
they might make some sort of ridiculous charge
against us to the police, in hopes we would be
held several days under suspicion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk looked astonished.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But see here, boss, we got our credentials
from Washington to prove we’re in the Secret
Service, an’ sky detectives at that; they jest
wouldn’t dare hold us on some sorter flimsy
charge ’cause that’d get ’em in hard with the
Government, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never know how these affairs may turn
out,” said Jack. “Often there seems to be some
kind of a jealous feeling between States officers
and those of the Government—almost like a little
vendetta, each arm of the Law striking out
at the other, and getting in a sly lick that’s good
for a laugh after hostilities have died down.
These Southern city police might make out
there was a grave charge of abduction or something
like that, compelling them to hold us <i>incommunicado</i>—that
is keep us from intercourse
with the U. S. District Attorney’s office until
several days had elapsed and then setting us
free with a lot of apologies that didn’t mean anything
whatsoever.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! I get your drift partner,” said Perk,
frowning. “We sure can’t afford to spend any
of our valuable time in the hoosgow here, if we
c’n help it. ’Cause things set that way I hope
you get busy an’ fix it so we’ll shake the dust o’
this same burgh off our shoes in a hurry. Got
the date settled yet, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shook hands with, and said goodbye to Mr.
Adkins this morning, Perk and you are at
liberty to figure that out as you please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it’s <i>tonight</i>?” asked the other, looking
well satisfied with such an enticing programme.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wind and weather permitting we’ll clear out
soon after twilight settles down on the city and
the river,” Jack assured his understudy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me, I’m sittin’ pretty, an’ taking things as
they come along, old hoss,” continued Perk.
“Let’s perambulate and attend to the crying
needs of this high noon hour—the girl told me
they expected to have apple dumplings for lunch
today an’ that’s one I’d nominate as bein’ among
my prime favorites—you know I got a <i>few</i> I
really enjoy an’ that’s no lie either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I know a good many on your list—fact
is,” said frank Jack, “if I ran down the whole
menu this noon there’d be only a scant few that’s
missed being called your especial favorites each
in its turn as the wind blew. But just as well
we did all the eating while the chance lasts, for
only a magician can tell what our bill of fare is
going to be during the coming week or two—some
weird dishes most likely—boiled owl,
fried rattlesnake, baked prairie dog—Heaven
knows to what ends we may be reduced.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have a heart, partner, don’t take my healthy
appetite away by mentionin’ them terrible
dishes. ’Member you promised we’d hire a taxi
after lunch, an’ drive all around the city, lampin’
the big sights like the French market, the queer
buryin’ places where holes in thick walls take
the place o’ graves, on ’count o’ there bein’ so
much water in the ground, with the city settin’
so low down, an’ the ol’ Mississippi on one o’
its benders. Then I want to eat Gulf oysters
an’ shrimp at one o’ them cute little stands we
noticed yesterday afternoon; try a reg’lar Creole
dinner tonight at that place Mr. Adkins told us
about—after which I’m all done with Orleans,
an’ ready to pull up stakes for keeps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll keep that to the last, Perk, and go to
the flying field from the eating house by taxi.
From that time on we’ll have to depend on our
own heads and hands to keep us out of difficulties.
But let’s hope we can climb up to a three
thousand foot ceiling, and strike out as if we
were aiming for Savannah or Jacksonville, only
to swing around inside of half an hour, climb
high over the city and river and put for the
Texas border at full speed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This enchanting program gave Perk much
cause for rejoicing and he sat down at their regular
table in the restaurant feeling, as he expressed
it, “happy as a clam at high tide” and
full of little laughs that seemed to gurgle up
from his shoes.</p>

<p class='c013'>They chatted of other happenings, not wishing
to “talk shop” in such a crowded place, lest
listening ears pick up certain information that
could be used greatly to their disadvantage—Perk
had an endless fund of interesting reminiscences
that, told in his inimitable fashion,
were a never failing source of joy to the appreciative
air pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was spent in motoring all
around the most interesting portions of the city,
the obliging Mr. Adkins having made out a list
of subjects they should not miss seeing while on
this first visit to the justly famous Louisiana metropolis.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIII <br /> <br />THE HOP-OFF</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Leaving the hotel, after settling their account,
and still making use of the taxi with its accommodating
driver, Jack and his comrade had
taken what small amount of hand luggage they
possessed along with them, not meaning to come
back again.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins had recommended a small but
unique restaurant run by a buxom French madame,
where they could have a Creole supper,
such as would long haunt their memories as a
genuine treat and it was to this place they ordered
their driver to convey them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both of them felt fairly convinced they had
been shadowed during the afternoon, although
so carefully must this have been accomplished
they had no positive proof to make it what Perk
would term a “dead certainty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They really did have a delightful “feed,” and
the dishes set before them were as a rule complete
mysteries although the obliging madame,
seeing they were tasting her triumphs of the
French <i>chef’s</i> art for the first time, gladly explained
the nature of the food they consumed
with so much gusto.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was fascinated with his supper, and inwardly
vowed that this should not be the last time
he would partake of tasty Creole dishes. This
duty fulfilled, they faced the next progressive
step in their night’s program—making for
the aviation field, and boarding their ship for
a speedy takeoff, their ultimate goal neither of
them could say just where, save that if all went
well they expected to be somewhere along the
California border within the next few days.</p>

<p class='c013'>The taxi was waiting, with the chauffeur on
the alert. He had already been advised of the
fact that they anticipated having some parties
attempt to spy upon them as evening settled
down and on this account he had maintained a
strict watch for troublesome visitors who might
even attempt to threaten him with bodily injury
unless he agreed to enter into their plans for
delaying the flight of the two flyers, as he knew
his passengers to be from what he had been told.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I see our taxi’s still on deck, partner,”
observed Perk, just as if he might have suspected
they would find it missing, with a detail of grim
city police waiting to escort them to the lockup,
they to be held in durance vile until serious
charges against them could be sifted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing came along to bother you, Henri?”
asked Jack of the smiling driver, who laughed
as he said in reply:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I haf seen one beeg hulk of ze man hanging
around, M’sieu, and looking as if he would like
to eat me up but me, I haf been an old soldier
in the Grand Army of France, and I think he did
not like the way I throw my chest out thees way,
and walk as eef I am on guard duty; he did not
address a single word to me, but just a little
while ago he disappear—I think he may haf
gone to get more courage out of ze glass.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good boy, Henri,” said the grinning Perk,
clapping a hand on the stalwart chauffeur’s
shoulder; “for myself I should not like to tackle
you when you have your fighting face all set.
Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So they were off, and heading out in the direction
of the aviation grounds, with the first shadows
of approaching evening gathering around
them. Perk may have been more or less nervous,
in anticipation of something coming to pass that
would seriously cripple their plans for a speedy
flight, since he kept turning his head from side
to side and scrutinizing every one they saw upon
the streets they traversed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Henri maintained a fairly good speed, all the
law would permit, so that few cars passed them
on the road. Perk managed to watch closely,
and never a motor came booming along in their
wake, honking to announce the driver’s intention
to pass by, than he had his eyes glued on the car
and continued to pay strict attention until it
had crept well up ahead.</p>

<p class='c013'>But after all nothing out of the way came to
pass, and eventually they reached the aviation
field where they found lights already in play,
since a delayed air mail ship was hovering over
signaling for better illumination. There was
some small damage in regard to the steering
gear, making it a bit risky to try a landing unless
the field was brilliantly lighted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You made an arrangement with a couple of
the ground force to hang around so as to help
us get the crate out okay, didn’t you, Perk?”
queried Jack, as they drew up close to the particular
hangar where they had seen their plane
placed in quarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, I sure did, Jack,” the other replied.
“Must be they’re over where that crate hanging
overhead means to land—somethin’ wrong mebbe
but they gimme their word to stay around
till we got here—there, I c’n lamp the guys
runnin’ thisaways right now, so it’s okay, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I see them coming,” returned the other,
himself a bit relieved, since the intended departure
was a most important episode in their plans,
and to meet with any sort of a setback would
be most aggravating indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The two mechanicians quickly arrived, the
hanger was unlocked and opened so as to permit
the exit of the ship. First of all both flyers
hastened to don their working togs, then fasten
on the ’chutes with the harness necessary for the
purpose, all working smoothly and finally clapping
their helmets on their heads, with the earflaps
secured to keep things in readiness for any
emergency that might crop up.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being accomplished, Jack gave the word
to have the heavy ship dragged out into the open.
He knew that his assistant would have looked
after everything essential to their comfort during
the coming flight for Perk was one of those
dependable fellows who carry out orders with
machine-like regularity.</p>

<p class='c013'>A few parties had hastened up to see what
was going on but so far as Perk could tell they
were either workers connected with the field, or
else visitors from the city, who had lingered to
watch the landing of the air mail, so as to tell
how it was done when they reached their several
homes, to partake of a late supper.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now the ship had been swung around so as
to head into the west, since the soft evening breeze
was coming from that quarter and everything
seemed in readiness for the take-off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, still surveying his surroundings as if
still cherishing a fragment of his former suspicions
that all might not be as lovely as surface
indications would announce, started to climb
aboard. Jack on his part was handing some
money to the two men, not wishing to leave a
single thing unpaid when passing out from New
Orleans—there was nothing to be done about
their use of the hangar, since Mr. Adkins had
assured him that matter had already been taken
care of, regardless of how long they chose to
linger in the Crescent City.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, too, cast a last glance around, just as he
would have done had he still been with the air
mail service and about to start off on his customary
night flight with the north-bound sacks
of letters and the express matter that vent along.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then he heard Perk give vent to a hurried
exclamation:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get aboard, partner; I guess the measly critters
are acomin’ down on us like hot cakes right
now. Lookit how they start arunnin’ thisaway,
will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did not bother looking, as every second
might be valuable; he climbed aboard with alacrity,
and settled down in his seat; at the same time
calling out to the helpers to stand aside. Then
he pulled the gun, with the motor responding
instantly, so well had Perk done his work when
checking up the ship that morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was still glueing his eyes on the several
figures now racing madly in their general direction,
and waving their arms wildly; no doubt
they had started to shout in addition, but the
descending air mail crate was making more or
less racket, which, added to by their own motor’s
thunder, prevented any one from hearing what
they may have been whooping.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was trembling with an excess of emotion—evidently
they had just escaped “by the
skin of their teeth,” for he felt certain he could
distinguish the uniforms of the police in the
little bunch of runners.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Played your hand just a mite too late, gents!”
Perk was whooping as he in turn waved a mocking
adieu backward; “thought you’d ketch a
weasel asleep, I guess, but not so easy, you gate
crashers. Wow! here we go spinnin’ along like
the wind, and it’s goodnight to the bunch. Huh!
shootin’ at us, air you—jest awastin’ ammunition,
that’s all, boys. Go ’way back an’ sit down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Jack lifted her in an upward fling, and
they were off like a startled hawk!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIV <br /> <br />SKIRTING THE GULF</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There was some shooting going on back there,
for although of course the watchful Perk failed
to catch the sound of discharges of guns, he did
see flash after flash, proclaiming that the police,
under the impression that important criminals
were beating them to it, wished to show
their warlike spirit by such a bombardment.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the flying missiles came anywhere near the
ascending plane that fact was not manifest to the
two occupants of the cockpit; their movements
must have been too speedy for such an attack to
be successful and almost immediately they had
risen beyond the danger line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was feeling vastly relieved, for it would
have been a bad beginning of their special mission
were they detained for days in the Southern
city, while the agents of the great counterfeit
league held the upper hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>He could see with the last glimpse he had of
the aviation field that all this lively accompaniment
to their take-off had created considerable
excitement—people were running back and
forth, like milling cattle when stampeded in a
furious thunder storm and Perk even fancied
there was some sort of a movement as though a
ship would be sent after them in pursuit.</p>

<p class='c013'>That troubled him not a bit, because already
they were leaving the field far in their wake, and
would really be lost in the gathering shadows of
coming night before any pursuit plane left the
ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides, had they not already had one experience
along those lines, and completely worsted
the persistent enemy, sending their boat down in
spirals of flames, with the two occupants forced
to “bail out” in order to save their lives?</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk put that possibility completely out of
his mind and busied himself with more practical
affairs. First of all he was desirous of communicating
with his comrade and to do this
they must have those indispensible head-phones
clapped to their ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was already applying his own pair with a
confidence inspired by frequent applications,
after which he managed to get Jack equipped
with the other pair.</p>

<p class='c013'>Steadily they continued to ascend, and swing
around until they faced the east, following the
plan Jack had outlined to his mate. Not too
high did the pilot urge his craft, since such a
course was apt to bring them in the sunlight
that still lingered along the upper air lanes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, they turned out to be a hot bunch all
right, partner,” was what Perk observed, when
he had the harness adjusted and the ear-phone
means of communication in shape for use.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You reckon they must have fetched the police
out with them, do you, Perk?” demanded the
one at the stick, as he kept an eye on his dials
spread across the black dashboard in front of the
cockpit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! just what they did, old hoss,” returned
the other, vehemently, but accompanying his remark
with a loud chuckle that told of secret
amusement, he being excessively fond of anything
that smacked of a joke; “an’ they kept up
a runnin’ fire at us, let me tell you—could see the
flashes spittin’ like fire crackers on the Fourth
o’ July.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All of which sounds like they must have told
a pretty wild and woolly yarn to the cops, to
make them want us as bad as that, eh, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Makes me think they got an idea this ain’t
goin’ to be just a ordinary man-hunt, but something
worth while; we should worry, Jack.
Mebbe they a’ready see the handwritin’ on the
wall, an’ mean to try an’ upset us in the start,
’fore we get agoin’ full tilt. Notice you’ve gone
an’ headed east, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It may fool them; but whether it does or not,
Perk, such a move’s our proper caper. When
we’ve gone something like ten or fifteen miles
we’ll get on the curve, swing around to the south,
and then when in sight of the gulf turn due west;
after that we’ll be on our way to the place where
our work is waiting for us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! had an idea you’d just climb till out
o’ sight, an’ then cross over the city and river—how
’bout it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too much risk to begin with,” came the ready
reply, showing how Jack always planned ahead;
“you know how a rushing boat can be heard
clearly even when lost to sight among the clouds.
It might be those same smart chaps, backed by
the authority of the police, would commandeer
a ship, and cruise around over the city, so as to
learn if we <i>did</i> come back so as to line out into
the heart of Texas; to make sure such a giveaway
of our plans can’t upset our calculations
we’ll cross the delta of the Mississippi close to
where it joins its muddy waters with the gulf.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you now, partner, an’ let me say I guess
that’s the safest game we c’n play. Time don’t
count anything wuth while with us on this trip
but results are what we crave.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it that time, boy, the Big Boss has
confidence in our being able to fetch home the
bacon, and we’re bound to prove he didn’t make
any mistake in putting us on the job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>All this time they continued to zoom along
like a frightened wild duck, and it was not long
before Jack was turning the nose of his ship
toward the south. The night had not as yet
settled down over the earth, although they were
holding an altitude of several thousand feet and
by straining his eyes a bit Perk was able to distinguish
objects far below—he could tell when
they passed over a large sheet of water, probably
Lake Ponchartrain, with narrower cuts winding
through vast marshes, and seas of waving reeds;
also begin to catch fugitive glimpses of the still
distant Mexican Gulf stretching away to the
mysterious south.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was all deeply interesting to Perk, always
on the lookout for fresh and novel scenes; for as
it happened, thus far in all his wanderings he
had really never looked upon that historical sheet
of salt water; although reading many a rattling
romance of the days when buccaneers and pirates
haunted the sub-tropical waters of that same
gulf, lying in wait for the Spanish galleons laden
with gold bars taken from the prodigally rich
mines of Mexico and Central America.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Perk’s mind those historical personages,
like Blackbeard, and his fellow rovers of the
Black Flag, lent a glamour to the great body of
water that was apt to thrill him through and
through whenever he allowed his gaze to fall
upon its restless surface, and dark secrets of the
past ages.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards their course was again
altered, with the ship swinging into the west. It
would seem to have been something like extreme
caution on Jack’s part but from all accounts, as
well as from their own experience with the desperate
gang that had given Uncle Sam so much
trouble, the scoundrels had a tremendous game
at stage, and were ready to go to any lengths to
protect the profitable conspiracy from being
smashed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Safety before speed” had always been Jack’s
slogan, which could be accounted one of the leading
reasons for the success that had come to him
in the various vocations he had followed—as a
county fair barn-stormer, then in the regular air
mail service, and now finally with the celebrated
Secret Service arm of the Government, entrusted
with one of the most abnormal duties ever given
out to its members.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not too dark for Perk to know when they
were passing over the several outlets to the
mighty river; indeed, he was even able to distinguish
an ocean going steamship heading up
toward the city of New Orleans; for its lights
were plainly in evidence and those who chanced
to be on deck could probably catch the throb of
their motor, since the air was unusually still,
allowing sounds to be heard at great distances,
especially when in the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then finally they left the water behind, and
found themselves passing over great stretches of
sugarcane, and bamboo thickets, with cabins of
the humble blacks in little hamlets, sometimes
villages of the lowlands, where, as Perk plainly
recollected, recent terrible floods had wrought
such damage.</p>

<p class='c013'>So the night wore on, and thus far nothing
had occurred to cause them the slightest worry.
If their cunning enemies suspected them of
planning to go west, and baiting the chief in his
lair, there was nothing as yet to show that they
were making arrangements to intercept the air
adventurers on their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>An hour—two of them passed, and still they
kept making rapid progress. The moon was long
above the eastern horizon, although occasionally
obscured by passing clouds but Perk told himself
it was a pretty fair night, all things considered,
and that he had “no kick coming.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c014'>CHAPTER XV <br /> <br />PERK AS A FIRE-FIGHTER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was not far from midnight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had insisted on taking over the controls,
so that Jack might secure a little rest, possibly
even pick up a few catnaps in addition. They
were at a low altitude, perhaps not more than a
thousand feet up, since the air was a bit cool
higher and it was certain they stood in no
danger from colliding with mountain peaks
while crossing the wide State of Texas, where
nothing save the level plains lay beneath.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was alive to his duties, but this did not
keep him from occasionally stretching his neck,
so as to look over the coaming of the cockpit,
and trying to make out objects that might be
dimly detected on the seemingly limitless plain
below.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a rule next to nothing worth while rewarded
these efforts and really he continued
doing his little stunt from sheer habit, but there
did come a time when he showed sudden interest,
and even half arose from his seat to stare
with increasing intensity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not only that but he immediately banked, to
start circling around a certain point. A minute
afterwards Perk reached out and shook Jack
gently by the shoulder. The ear-phones being
still affixed to their heads, Jack naturally desired
to know what was up, and did his pal wish to
give over the stick to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ doing, partner,” he was told with
emphasis; “but there’s somethin’ queer goin’ on
down yonder, and I’ve swung around so’s to give
it the once over. On your right, Jack, an’ there,
see how it sparks up again, will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say it looks like a fire,” ventured Jack,
after taking a good look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My idea to a fraction, boss!” snapped the
deeply interested Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like it might be breaking out through
the roof of some sort of cabin, or ranch house,”
further suggested Jack, himself now almost as
excited as his running mate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, boy!” declared Perk; “but somehow
I don’t lamp anybody kickin’ around in a
big fuss, ’cause o’ the shack bein’ ablaze; strikes
me either nobody ain’t to home or else they’re
so sound asleep they don’t know what’s goin’ on.
Glory be! if that’s the case, partner, they stand
a mighty good chance o’ bein’ burnt to death in
their beds. What ought we do ’bout it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“First place we’ve just got to rouse ’em up,
and the way to do that is to rush our engine to the
limit, so’s to make a big row—if that doesn’t
wake anybody it’ll only mean they’re away from
home—or else already smothered by the smoke.”
Perk accordingly started up such a racket that
the dreadful roaring noise seemed hoarse enough
to awaken the dead and all the while he kept
swinging around in a continuous circle.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, bending over the side, watched to see if
this had any effect, nor was his discovery long
delayed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That fetched them, Perk—I can see several
moving figures, and they seem to be rushing about
with pails in their hands. If the fire hasn’t got
too strong a start they may be able to throw
enough water to put it out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, couldn’t we do somethin’ more to help
the poor dicks?” cried Perk, ever ready and
willing to assist anybody in trouble, no matter
at what cost or personal risk to himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It mightn’t be a safe thing to attempt a blind
landing,” he was told; but something in Jack’s
voice or manner when he said this encouraged
Perk to go a bit further.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, chances are it’s as level as a barn floor
down there,” he hastened to say, eagerly; “here,
you could take the stick—there never was a better
hand at makin’ a three-point landin’ than
you, partner; me, I might drop a few flares down,
an’ that’d give us a squint o’ the ground. If we
kept to leeward o’ the fire there wouldn’t be any
risk from sparks, don’t you see, Jack? I never
yet had such a fat chance to be a fire-fighter;
let’s go, boy—they need all the help they c’n
get, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The temptation was so great it soon overpowered
Jack’s sense of caution; really he fancied
he would never forgive himself if he allowed
Perk to show a higher sense of duty to people
in distress than he himself could display.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, you win, Perk!” he quickly called
out; “hand over the stick, and get those flares
ready to drop when I give the word.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk started to make a move, showing that he
knew just where the objects of his desire were
located, for he did not have to leave his seat in
order to place his hand upon the small package
of flares.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile Jack had reduced their speed to
a minimum compatible with safety, still continuing
that circular movement. The fire had
by this time assumed sufficient proportions to
dispel any doubts they may have entertained regarding
its true nature, for it was burning at a
lively rate. Jack could see a crouching figure
sprawled on the roof, and apparently emptying
bucket after bucket of water on the greedy flames,
and passing the empties back down the nearby
ladder to some one standing on an upper rung.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was all mighty exciting, and to Jack seemed
like some sort of fetching picture as shown on
the silver screen at the movies—a scene developed
through the skill of a wizard director, aided
by a group of star actors, so as to bring out all
the realistic effects.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get ready, Perk!” he told the other suddenly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All set, partner,” came the inspiring response.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let her go, then!” called out the pilot, just
as he found himself over a point to leeward of the
burning ranch house that he figured would be
the best place to make a landing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had a flare falling almost as the last
words left the lips of the pilot and then both
of them used their eyes to advantage as it neared
the ground, lighting up a small section fairly
well—at least what he thus saw seemed to convince
Jack it would be fairly safe to attempt a
landing, for the ground looked smooth, and free
from outbuildings, corrals, or wire fences.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Drop another, quick as you can!” directed
Jack; then, as this was carried out he started
down, showing the die was cast, come what
would.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk threw a third flare to one side, in the
hope that its light would afford his pilot a chance
to effect one of his really marvelous landings;
which turned out to be sound reasoning on his
part—the shock when their landing gear came in
contact with the ground was not very severe, and
Jack managed so that they did not run more than
thirty feet toward the burning house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus far all was well.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was out of the cockpit like a flash, but
managed to hold his eager spirit in check long
enough to allow his comrade to join him. Then
they hurried over to the building, which they
could now see, thanks to both the moonlight and
the brilliance of the blaze, must be some kind of
a ranch house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Several men who had the appearance of cow
punchers were working for all they were worth,
fetching water from a well, and hurling it where
it was calculated to do the most good.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s give you a hand in that game, neighbors!”
Jack burst out with, as he joined the string,
backed by Perk, and commenced handling
buckets full and buckets empty, with as much
vim as though tested and tried members of a
village fire company.</p>

<p class='c013'>At such a time the addition of two more
willing workers can do considerable toward
smothering a fire, especially when there happens
to be no wind moving; and from the moment of
their arrival things began to take on a better
look as though up to then the fight had been
hovering “on the fence,” as Perk called it, and
the balance being overturned, victory was in
sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was in his glory, and the brisk way in
which he hurried those buckets along was worth
going a long way to witness; Jack never would
forget how proud he felt over the marvelous performance
of his running mate, and how those
encouraging cries, so constantly emitted by Perk,
seemed to enthuse everybody with fresh vim and
go.</p>

<p class='c013'>Finally the last spark was extinguished, and
the house saved, having suffered but scant damage.
Then the men, yes, and women too, gathered
around the pair of aviators who had come
on the scene just in the nick of time, to first of
all arouse the people of the prairie ranch to a
sense of the danger that hovered over their heads,
and finally take chances in effecting what might
have been a rough landing, so as to lend their
material aid to the fire fighters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Surely you will not think of starting off again
till break of day,” the big man with the white
head of hair, evidently the rancher himself, was
saying, while engaged in pumping the hands of
the two who had dropped down from the sky,
as it were, to bring warning of the burning roof,
and start the stiff fight against the greedy flames
that had ended so successfully. “Stay and eat
breakfast with us, strangers; we’d like to know
you both some better, and have a chance to thank
you most heartily.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unfortunately we must be on our way, neighbor,”
Jack told him. “It happens we are on
special duty, and delay might upset certain plans
we are bent on following out. It was just by
sheer accident we discovered the fire, and took
the customary means for attracting attention that
all air pilots employ; but some other day, if we
chance to be in this neighborhood, we’d be
pleased to see more of you all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The women added their voices to the pressing
invitation, but Jack was forced to decline, although
doing so smilingly, since he would have
liked very much to see more of these warm-hearted
stockmen and their wild riders, possibly
picking up some useful knowledge concerning
the way a ranch is run in these modern days, so
different from early times in the cattle country.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is absolutely necessary for us to be going,”
Jack told them all, “if we are lucky enough to
be able to hop-off again. Perk, I wish you’d
take a look over toward the west, and see if the
ground is fairly clear; while I talk for a few
more minutes with our new friends here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was astute enough to avoid giving their
names to any one but the ranchman, who readily
promised not to mention them to a living soul;
he felt heavily indebted to Jack and his chum,
and considered that they knew their business
best—for one thing he felt absolutely certain the
fact of their being in such a hurry had nothing
whatever to do with any unlawful act on their
part—he had as much confidence in them as
though Jack had actually confided the fact of
their being Government Secret Service agents,
bound on a mission fraught with much peril to
life and limb, the prime object of which was to
save honest people from being victimized by a
gang of unprincipled sharks, makers of clever
bank notes that were without the pale of the
law and only base counterfeits, although clever
imitations of the genuine bills.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVI <br /> <br />IN THE GRIP OF THE STORM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Perk soon afterwards showed up, and seemed
so cheerful that it was evident his little scouting
mission had yielded favorable results.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems okay to me, partner!” he burst out
with, as soon as she came along; “course it ain’t
just as smooth as some fields we know but there
ain’t goin’ to be any smart trouble takin’ off, I
guess now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And are we holding the nose of the ship
straight in line of the course you took a squint
at, Perk?” Jack asked, as he prepared to climb
into his seat, the people of the ranch clustering
around, to gaze with wide open eyes at the fleet
aircraft, some of them doubtless seeing such a
modern cloud clipper for the first time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dead ahead, boss, an’ you’ll strike the right
racket, I’m tellin’ you,” came the positive assurance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then jump aboard, comrade, and we’ll put
it to the test,” saying which Jack himself climbed
into the waiting cockpit, to settle down in his
accustomed seat, take a quick glance at his dials
when the small light was turned on, and await
a signal from the other sky traveler that he was
“fixed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The way was clear, and the fact that just then
the gay old moon condescended to poke her smiling
face out from behind a mass of clouds assisted
more or less in giving the pilot some of the
necessary illumination—the rest must be left to
his native sagacity and instinct.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a bunch of cottonwoods at some
little distance ahead, the location of which Perk
had pointed out to his mate before settling down
in his seat but if all went well Jack calculated
to be able to clear them in good shape—did it
seem necessary he could swerve slightly to the
right, and have a clear field for the take-off.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a little shouting as the friendly
plane started to taxi along, but of course this was
smothered by the increasing roar of exhaust and
spinning propeller. Faster and faster they scurried
onward, and then started to rise on an angle
just sufficient to nicely clear the tops of the cottonwoods;
when Jack jazzed his motor, to find
it running as “sweet as a purring cat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So they departed only a short time after making
that landing which humanity had demanded
and in times to come the little episode was
likely to afford both aviators more or less satisfaction,
in that they had “seen their duty and
done it,” as Perk would say in his whimsical
way.</p>

<p class='c013'>As they continued on their way Perk found
himself wondering if this interesting adventure
was destined to be a sample of other equally
thrilling happenings in store for them the further
they dipped into the great game that had been
laid at their door by the powers that be at Washington.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whenever he came to thinking of the audacity
shown by Slippery Slim in virtually defying all
the authority of the Government, Perk would
feel his dander rising as if in great indignation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh!” he at one time told himself, being
rather fond of thus communing, as his thoughts
ran on, “we’ll call <i>his</i> bluff just the same, the
scaly ol’ gila monster, you wait an’ see. Thinks
he’s the whole works, the boss man-handler, does
he, just ’cause he’s outguessed a number o’ the
boys. This time he’s due to find himself up
against guys o’ the right size, who’ll jerk him
down off’n his high perch in a jiffy, or I miss
my ticket.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk kept on boasting in his customary
fashion, possibly to keep his mind on the subject.
Jack was paying little attention to side issues
just then for he knew his pal’s peculiarities, and
short-comings as well and having “exhausted
his boiler” Perk presently lapsed into utter
silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had climbed to a fairly high ceiling, and
caught only occasional fugitive glimpses of the
earth far below, when the moon chanced to break
through the banks of clouds, which intervals
became less and less frequent, Jack noticed.</p>

<p class='c013'>He did not altogether fancy the looks of the
heavens, by degrees becoming more and more
overcast; still, this might after all mean next to
nothing and their business was to keep steadily
on their way as if things were bound to come out
all right.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was now drawing well on toward midnight,
and they had placed hundreds of miles between
the city of their recent stay and themselves. Long
since Perk had taken what proved to be his last
glimpse of the vast gulf as seen far away toward
the south, when the night was brightly illuminated,
with the moon’s silvery rays shining on the
glistening waters, and making a picture that
even appealed to Perk’s rugged nature—after
that all he was able to make out was the monotonous
level plains that lay in every quarter,
as though the whole earth consisted of this same
stock country.</p>

<p class='c013'>No longer were they able to find any cheer in
the company of the moon, for the canopy above,
earlier in the night peopled by a multitude of
bright stars, was now gripped in dense masses
of clouds.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having thus lost his guide marks below, Jack
was compelled to place all dependence upon his
faithful instruments, but this of course was an
old story to one of his experience, so that he did
not do any worrying on that score.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, buried in his own thoughts, and paying
scant heed to what changes were taking place
in the signs of the weather, had no warning until
suddenly there came a dazzling flash, that was
almost instantly succeeded by a tremendous burst
of thunder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ginger pop! that means we’re booked for a
bit o’ storm, mebbe, eh, Jack?” was his startled
exclamation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s hope it turns out to be <i>only</i> a bluster,”
the pilot went on to say, as he turned the nose of
his ship upward, and commenced to climb, evidently
in hopes that by so doing they might get
above those low hanging clouds, and have clear
sailing while the disturbance lasted.</p>

<p class='c013'>When shortly afterwards a second electrical
crash almost stunned them by its violence, Perk
began to fumble for his oilskin coat, which he
was never without when aboard a boat with an
open cockpit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk could take a ducking with as much good
nature as the next fellow but just the same he
did not intend to get soaked if he could help it,
since a continuance of the flight, with a cold wind
likely to follow the rain, would not prove to be
the most delightful experience possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>No sooner had he accomplished the job of
securing his raincoat than he gave Jack the well
known signal that he meant to take over the
stick, and thus allow his comrade to also protect
himself against bad weather.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly both of them were presently thus
equipped, and ready to take whatever might be
in the offing. Meanwhile the ascent was continued
in spasms, for there was always a chance
of getting above such a storm, and avoiding the
worst of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The thunder claps became more frequent, and
also much louder, so that each sudden burst gave
them both a thrill, death seemed so close, for
should their speeding ship chance to attract one
of those dazzling bolts it would be all over for
the daring air adventurers, and no one be the
wiser concerning their taking-off, until possibly
after long months had passed, their bleached
bones might be discovered by some party of
plainsmen out looking for rustlers or seeking to
round up missing stock.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus far not a single drop of rain had fallen,
according to Perk’s calculations but the coming
of the drenching flood could not be much longer
delayed, he felt positive. Had there not been
so much racket around them those keen ears of
his might have detected a rushing sound in the
near distance, like the roar of the incoming tide
on the sandy shores of the gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then it came with a swoop, the wind whistling
around their ears and the rain beating a tattoo
against the fuselage of the ship, as well as striking
them smartly in the face, despite such protection
as their helmets and heavy goggles afforded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack certainly had his hands full in managing
the bobbing, shifting craft, gripped by those
shifty gusts that came with giant force, making
the flyers feel as though they were clinging to a
mere chip tossed about in the wild fury of a
Texas tempest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Time and again did Perk feel as though his
heart had jumped up in his throat, almost choking
him; seasoned veteran at this sort of thing
as he believed himself to be, he could not help
this feeling of helplessness in the hands of the
aroused elements; yet each time Jack managed
to bring their ship through the teeth of the storm
in a way that was next door to miraculous, and
if Perk had up to this time not fully appreciated
the astonishing skill and confidence of his younger
companion while at the controls in an emergency,
he certainly was getting his lesson then and
there, in a way to cause it to sink deep, and stick.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch17' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVII <br /> <br />A FIGHT WELL WON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was no longer possible for the busy pilot to
keep on his course. Every minute of his time
was taken up with a desperate effort to keep
from being thrown into a nose dive, that, unless
miraculously conquered, would be likely to
send them whirling down, to crash from a five
thousand foot ceiling, and thus bring about a
complete writeoff.</p>

<p class='c013'>That however was the least of Jack’s worries—all
he asked was the ability and luck to be
able to fend off threatening disaster; could this
be done successfully in good time they could
pick up all that was lost, and once more continue
their westward flight.</p>

<p class='c013'>The battering they endured was simply tremendous,
and Jack marveled at the ship being
able to withstand such a horrible strain. If
but a single strut gave way under all that pounding
it would mean starting a series of similar
mishaps such as would quickly render them incapable
of keeping aloft; and with this threat
hanging over their heads it can readily be understood
neither of the two could be in a comfortable
frame of mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still it is wonderful how men thus threatened
will continue to carry on, although in an almost
mechanical fashion, doing just the necessary
thing with each change of pace on the part of
the tricky storm, and meeting successfully every
near tragedy as it arises to clutch them in its
grip.</p>

<p class='c013'>No longer did Jack keep on climbing—it
seemed to him that the further the staggering
boat lifted the more dangerous became their
situation for the air was surcharged with electricity
as the zigzag lightning darted from cloud
to cloud, doubling the chances of their frail
craft being struck.</p>

<p class='c013'>In fact it seemed so terrible above that he
lacked the nerve to persist in the upward work,
and even commenced to drop down. Perk
noticing this move, hardly knew what to make
of it. He was, as he himself would have expressed
it, “hanging on by his teeth,” in order
to keep his seat in the wildly plunging airship
and on finding that the bold pilot had given up
hope of finding relief in the upper regions, the
fact appalled him. Could it be Jack had decided
to attempt a landing, with only the glare
of those repeated electrical flashes to serve as
airport lights? That indeed would be next to
admitting their case as hopeless, and that Jack
was taking such desperate chances only as a last
resort.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were zooming along all this time as if
pursued by a jinx and indeed with such weird
accompaniments it would not be hard to believe
the spirit of the storm took on the part of such a
goblin of the air, to pursue relentlessly this bold
invader of the home of the aroused elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk hit the bullseye close to the center when
afterwards, in describing their experience on
this night of the great blow, he vowed they were
“playing dice with death,” since it seemed a bare
chance that they could ever pull through alive.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such is the life of the aviator—one hour sailing
smoothly along, at peace with all mankind,
envying no man his following, and feeling himself
to be on the top of the world—the next and
he may be fighting with might and main the
mad demons of the air, his life hanging in the
balance, his strength ebbing fast, and unless the
little cherub aloft that is said to be watching
over each sailor, whether of the sea or the limitless
air, comes to the rescue, his fate is sealed,
and another modern Argonaut never comes back
again to the home port.</p>

<p class='c013'>It did not seem to be any the less exciting even
when they had succeeded in gaining a much
lower altitude; although possibly the danger
from those thunderbolts might have been somewhat
abated. Perk soon realized that his pilot
had no intention of trying for a landing in the
midst of such a turmoil and confusion, which
fact relieved his harried feelings to some extent.
Indeed, it would have been a mad proceeding,
and almost unheard of, since hardly the slightest
chance offered for the most skillful pilot to
reach the earth without disaster, such as making
a ground loop, and having the heavy engine bury
them under its weight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk endeavored to convince himself that
things were a bit easier since a lower altitude
had been effected but in so doing he feared he
was only deceiving himself—if anything at all
things were even worse,—although the drop
might not be so far, which was small comfort,
since it must mean their complete annihilation
if it befell them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had numerous spasms when he fancied
something was going amiss with their staunch
craft, although unable to decide the exact nature
of the imaginary trouble. Despite all these
chills, which must have been the products of his
excitement, they managed to hold out minute
after minute, which fact gave more or less cause
for renewed hope.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack must indeed be almost completely exhausted,
and yet he refused to give up the controls,
to which his hands seemed glued as though
riveted there. Perk punched his side numbers
of times, but could get no favorable response,
proving that the other deemed it too hazardous
a proceeding to change possession of the stick
while in the whirl of that shrieking gale—which
was indeed only another adaptation of the old
proverb “it is folly to change horses when crossing
a stream.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no means for communication with
each other, even though they may have wished
to do so, since the ear-phones had been discarded
with the donning of their slickers, and
could not be put back in position, owing to the
sudden bursting of the storm, and the necessity
for employing their hands in more useful pursuits.</p>

<p class='c013'>All Perk could do was to hang on, keeping
himself ready to seize hold should his companion
be suddenly compelled to release his grip
through sheer weariness—that, and keeping tabs
of the weather, so as to glean the first favorable
sign that came along, promising a let-up, or at
least a break.</p>

<p class='c013'>Judging from the heavy rain that had come
down in such a solid stream it must be reckoned
one of those dreadful cloud-bursts of which he,
Perk, had so often heard, but which thus far in
his experience he had never met up with. No
doubt rivers would be out of their beds long before
dawn although that angle of the situation
did not interest them in the least, since their
traveling would not be interfered with a particle,
if only the air proved inviting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yes, soon Perk believed he could detect a lessening
of the baffling crosswinds that had been
so trying to the pilot, keeping him continually
on the anxious seat—then, too, it struck him the
floods were growing weaker in the bargain;
which two facts gave poor Perk a feeling akin to
joy in the region of his heart, such as he may
have known on previous occasions, but that must
have been far down in his adventurous past.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to their altimeter they were something
like two thousand feet from the ground,
but of course never the faintest glimpse could
they secure of what lay beneath them, so poor
was the visibility, with all that torrent of water
pouring down as might a mountain cataract.</p>

<p class='c013'>This delightful feeling grew stronger as minutes
passed—at this rate he would soon be able
to influence tired Jack to renounce his frozen
hold on the stick, and turn the handling of the
ship over to his chum.</p>

<p class='c013'>In this frame of mind he again nudged the
other, but in turn received a negative shake of
the head, which meant there was “nothing doing”—in
other words, since the storm still raged,
even though in somewhat diminished violence,
they must not be too premature, and spoil it all
just when the victory seemed about to drop into
their hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>With what Perk hoped would prove to be a
last dying spurt the rain came pelting down,
after which it suddenly stopped as though an
unseen hand away up among the clouds, had
plugged the gap, and kept any more water from
running out—enough was enough, surely, Perk
was telling himself when he made this thrilling
discovery and for one he felt he had had sufficient
rain to last him the balance of that year.</p>

<p class='c013'>So too did the wind start to diminish its force,
also coming from one direction with more constancy—some
relief to Jack, that was certain,
since now he could know just how to steer his
turbulent craft so as to meet the force driving
against it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then what did Perk do but start getting his
ear-phones adjusted, being wild to hear a human
voice, after all that fiendish roaring and howling
kicked up by the raging elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>Why, already the atmosphere had cleared
enough for him to catch faint glimpses of what
lay beneath them—it looked as though they had
come to a stretch of country where the level
prairie had changed into rougher ground, with
deep swales, sometimes running into quite respectable
ravines and there were indications of
ridges ahead, which might even prove to be
fairly high, so that it would have been tempting
Providence had Jack dropped still lower, while
flying blind through all that welter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Talk to me ’bout luck,” the grateful Perk
was saying to himself, “I never ran ’cross anything
like <i>this</i>—they told me Jack must a been
born under a lucky star, an’ now I sure b’lieves
it to be the right stuff they were givin’ me, an’
no taffy either. But that was some fight, take
it from me, fellers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards Jack condescended to give
him the sign that he was willing to pass up the
job; whereat Perk quickly superseded him as
pilot, and saw the other sink back in his cramped
quarters as though unable to hold up his tired
arms a second longer. Apparently the relief
had come not a minute too soon, for he must have
been close to the point of utter exhaustion after
so long and violent a strain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Battered as the crate had been while the gale
lashed them so madly, it had stood up under the
buffeting most amazingly and Perk would
never have occasion to utter anything saving
words of praise for the model and its makers;
it must be as near perfection as aircraft are being
built these days of man’s victory over the
savage forces of the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Setting his course in what he believed to be the
proper direction Perk waited until Jack seemed
fairly well recovered, when he was pleased to
see the other take up his head harness as though
he too felt the necessity for opening up communications
with his running mate, which outlook
gratified Perk immensely.</p>

<p class='c013'>There were many things he wished to have
made clear, and besides, he felt more than curious
to learn what Jack’s next move might turn
out to be—that they had drifted far from their
original course went without saying but a means
must be found to recover the lost ground, after
which they could take up the game again just
where the sudden storm had caused such a diversion.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then the moon peeped out through a
break in the clouds overhead, as though to tell
them it was all over, with decent weather once
more in the offing.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch18' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVIII <br /> <br />THE DESERTED SHACK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Well, that’s somehow I guess over, and I’m
mighty glad,” was the way Perk voiced his feelings,
when the clouds were rolling away, and the
heavenly host of stars backed up the moon in
lighting up the firmament.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Same here,” echoed Jack, still more or less
tired after his energetic battle with the unleashed
elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And strikes me the air’s got some chilly,”
added the other; “I own up I’m shivering to
beat the band right now. Where d’ye figger we
might be, partner—must a lost our course in all
that kettle o’ rain an’ wind, an’ drifted far to
the south, eh, what, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question about it, Perk; I could feel the
pull right along; still, there wasn’t a thing to do
but let the old crate take the reins in her teeth.
Once morning comes we’ll manage somehow to
get a line on our locality, and swing back to our
course.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some hours off yet,” ventured Perk, whose
lips were indeed trembling, as if the chill was
beginning to get in its work—perhaps all that
recent excitement was helping to make him
shiver, as it often will, even in the case of the
most valiant of men.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack noticed this fact, even though he himself
experienced nothing similar, for some reason or
other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Perk, you ought to have a chance
to sit alongside a warm fire and dry off; the rain
must have got under your slicker, and I reckon
now you’re slopping around in water back there.
Something’s <i>got</i> to be done about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! boss, don’t bother ’bout me; I’m a
hard-shell you must know, an’ a little dampness
ain’t agoin’ to do me any harm, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just the same we’ll try and make a landing,”
continued the other, “if there’s half a chance;
all I’d want would be to stack up against a level
stretch of upland, where the drainage had carried
off all that flood.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, that sounds all to the good, boy but
what difference will it make, I want to know?
After such a storm it’s bound to be some cold
even away down here along the Texas-Arizona
line; they call them Northers, jest like I’ve heard
they do down in Florida. Forget it, partner—I’m
a tough guy, an’ ain’t wantin’ to be coddled
like a baby.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just the same I say we’re going to land, if
half a chance shows up,” affirmed the pilot, in
that set way of his. “We’ll find the stuff to build
some sort of fire, Perk, where you could make
a pot of hot coffee; which’d do you more good
than a switch of hard liquor. Put that in your
pipe and smoke it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk remained silent for almost two whole
minutes, during which time no doubt he was
revolving in his mind what Jack had proposed—in
imagination he could almost <i>smell</i> the delicious
aroma of the coffee, boiling so merrily
over the red coals and even feel a joyous sensation
of warmth stealing through his chilled body.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Okay, Jack; you win, hands down. Me for
the coffee every time, to be followed by a quiet
smoke o’ my fav’rite brand o’ tobac. Have your
own way about it, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then get ready to try and make out what
sort of ground we’ll soon be passing over,” added
Jack, as he turned the ship earthward, and slid
down on a long glide, with the motor clamped
shut. “We’ll skim along close enough for you
to get a good idea as to how matters stand, and
yet giving enough distance to keep clear of any
clump of trees, or little bald knobs of rises.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently Perk assured him he could manage
to get fair glimpses at what lay below; at which
Jack again started on an even keel, moving with
as little speed as was compatible with safety.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not very long before the watcher gave
tongue.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Looks good to me down yonder, partner—guess
now we might make a safe an’ sane landin’—’specially
with <i>you</i> at the stick. Circulate
a little bit to the south, brother, ’cause it looks
some better thataways.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This Jack did, and then at another signal from
the observer, he proceeded to drop down with
almost as much confidence as he might have felt
when making a landing on Candler Field, well
lighted, and with every convenience suited to
safety and comfort.</p>

<p class='c013'>His confidence, it seemed, had not been misplaced,
for they effected a very fair contact, all
things considered, even though the landing was
somewhat “joggly and rough” as Perk expressed
it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once the ship came to a stop and both of them
hastened to clamber out of their close quarters—“cribbed,
cabined and confined,” Jack sometimes
liked to say in connection with their limited
cockpit, although his pal always reminded him
of the fact that <i>cabin</i> was something only conspicuous
by its absence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk’s first movement was to start threshing
his arms against his thighs with more or less
vigor, in which he showed good common sense
since there is no better method for stirring up
sluggish circulation after a long period of inaction.
Jack on his part commenced to check
up on certain sections of the undergear, meaning
to make certain he had done no damage in making
connection with the earth under such unfavorable
conditions.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything in ship-shape, I reckon, Perk,”
he announced. “And now let’s make out to find
something in the line of trees, where we might
pick up enough wood for that fire.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Looks kinder like things’d be mighty well
soaked after all that downpour,” affirmed the
shrewd Yankee-Canadian; “so it’d be a tough
job coaxin’ stuff to take fire. But wait a minute,
partner—I didn’t get a chance to tell you that I
spied what looked like an ol’ tumbledown shack
over to windward—I guess now it might be
abandoned, but just the same, partner, we’d be
apt to run across some dry wood inside.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suppose you step over and take a look-in,
Perk,” suggested the other. “I’ll stand by the
crate here, and keep our little glim working, so
you’ll get your bearings when you start back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, Jack,” acceded the lanky one,
always eager for any sort of service; “an’ by the
same token now I’ll tote my gun along—never
c’n tell what sorter game you’ll stack up against
on these here Texas plains, I’m told. I feel like
I could knock over a wolf er two, just to get my
blood to movin’ at a faster clip—how ’bout it,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suit yourself, Perk,” he was told, as Jack
climbed back into the cockpit so as to manipulate
the light he mentioned, and which would prove
sufficient to serve the wanderer as a beacon when
wishing to retrace his steps.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly Perk wandered off, having decided
as to the quarter where he had glimpsed
what looked like an old and lonely shack or
cabin, faintly seen in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>He came back in a short time, bubbling over
with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all right, Jack—just like I guessed, it
turned out to be an ownerless shack but the roof
looks like it might’ve shed the rain, an’ oh! boy!
heaps o’ dry wood inside, with a whoppin’ big
fireplace where you could slap on the biggest
log agoin’. Mebbe I ain’t glad you thought o’
this game. Come along, an’ we’ll fetch the stuff
for a warm snack—coffee, crackers, an’ bacon
in the bargain. Talk to me about luck, it’s comin’
to us in big chunks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! we’ve got to get used to that sort of
thing,” said Jack, in the most matter-of-fact tone
imaginable; “when you’re on such a wonderful
lay as this anything’s likely to happen, and all
kinds of surprises spring out at you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder,” was all Perk could say in reply;
but he lost no time in gathering together such
articles as aluminum coffeepot, skillet, cups, and
such other things as he knew would be needed to
complete their little midnight spread.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon it’s safe for us to leave our crate
off here,” remarked the cautious Jack, “but I’ll
fix things so no busybody can take-off while we’re
away,” which he did without any trouble; after
which they both set out to move along to the
deserted shack Perk had located, lying right
there, just as if a favoring Fate had designed it
for their especial benefit in an emergency, as
the grateful Perk told himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Arriving at the humble shack, that once may
have housed a happy family in days that were
gone, they made use of Jack’s electric torch in
order to gather some dry splinters of wood,
which, heaped above some paper on the open
hearth, soon blazed up, and afforded them an
opportunity to take a look around.</p>

<p class='c013'>Other fuel more lasting was hurriedly added
to the fire, and this done the two air adventurers
took stock of their surroundings. There was
nothing much to see, since the shack happened
to be entirely devoid of any kind of furniture,
even of the most primitive make; but the roof
had stood the ravages of time, and promised to
hold out for years still to come.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk held out his chilled hands to the blaze
but only for a few minutes; apparently the possibility
of brewing some “nectar” was an overpowering
temptation, for presently he started to
work.</p>

<p class='c013'>In short order he had the steam coming out
of the coffee pot spout, and a most delightful
odor permeated the interior of that ancient
shack. When the coffee was ready, Perk poured
some of the amber fluid in both aluminum cups,
and offered Jack one, together with a freshly
opened carton of tempting crackers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goes right to the spot,” the self-made <i>chef</i>
observed, rubbing a hand across his stomach, as
though experiencing the most blissful sensation
there; “best coffee I ever tasted, barrin’ none,
an’ say, I’ve tried it a good many places like
France and Germany, as well as in Turkey too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Same here,” Jack assured him, as he drained
his first cup. “By the way, didn’t you say you’d
fetched some bacon along over here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jest what I did, partner, an’ now I’ve had
my fust swaller o’ coffee I’ll get a move on an’
soon have some o’ the same asizzlin’ in the pan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He started to carry out his words, with the
interested Jack watching his efforts to try and
make the frying pan set evenly on the fire, a feat
that requires considerable knowledge of camp
tactics in order to be successful. After one near
spill, with Perk only saving an upset by quick
work, Jack modestly broke in to give a bit of
advice, not forgetting, however, that old saying
about “too many cooks spoil the broth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too hot to keep hold of the handle looks like,
partner; now if only we were outdoors we might
find stones enough to form some sort of foundation
on three sides of the fire, where you could
rest your pan. Hold on, here’s this old hearth
that was made of some kind of Mexican bricks—adobe
they call them and it looks to me like
some of ’em might be loose. Here, I’ll manage to
pry a few up for you, Perk, old man—just hold—your—horses
and——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did not finish his sentence, and the cook,
glancing up to see what ailed him, found his
pal holding the first adobe in an uplifted hand,
while he was himself staring hard into the cavity
from which it had come, as if he saw something
wonderfully fascinating there!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch19' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIX <br /> <br />FORTUNE KNOCKS AT THE DOOR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“I swan! what’s the matter, partner—my
sakes; is it a <i>rattler</i> you uncovered, I wanter
know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk on his part was already sharing the excitement
of his pal, although apparently from
an entirely different reason. He had already
started to scramble to his knees, being doubtless
bent on taking some aggressive action, when he
saw Jack reach forward and deliberately pluck
some object from the hole under the displaced
adobe fire brick, and hold it up to view.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he saw its nature Perk’s jaw dropped, and
he was the picture of abject astonishment—but
it was far from being any poisonous reptile that
Jack was thus exhibiting with such a grand
flourish; just as though he might be some necromancer
or magician, and drawing all manner of
amazing things out of an apparently empty
stove-pipe hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gosh-a-mighty! that looks like real money!
I swan!” burst from Perk’s lips, as he continued
to stare.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just what it’s supposed to be, Pal Perk,”
said Jack, trying to keep his own voice from
displaying a genuine tremolo—“a neat wad of
it, waiting here for us to drop in and pick it up.
Seems like things might be set up, like tenpins
in the alley, for two lucky dogs to knock down
with a couple of rolled balls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If that don’t beat anything I ever did see,”
continued the astounded Perk, now grinning, as
though the pleasant nature of their find was
commencing to appeal to him. “Jest think o’ a
pair o’ air tramps ahappenin’ along, runnin’
across this here deserted shack, an’ findin’ a fortune
askin’ to be taken care of—don’t it beat the
Dutch what c’n happen—Arabian Night’s adventures
can’t hold a candle to the real thing in
these modern days. Some ol’ miser musta hid
that boodle under the bricks, so’s to keep the
Mex raiders comin’ up over the international
border from gettin’ their itchin’ fingers on it—how
’bout that, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Off color, I’m afraid, Perk,” Jack told him,
after taking a quick look at his wonderful find
in the hearth <i>cache</i>; “that miser story might go
with some but it doesn’t wash with me worth
a red cent. In the first place if this money had
been hidden here by a miser, he’d have taken it
away with him when he cut stick. Then again
it would surely have been partly in hard cash,
like gold eagles, and such stuff—all hoards of
misers, you remember, are made up like that,
Perk, and when you give this the once-over
you’ll also notice how it’s all in bills, mostly
fresh ones at that, as if they hadn’t seen much
circulation, as you might say.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk drew in a long breath, and continued to
stare hard at the object Jack was holding out in
front of him; it might be that something in the
other’s words and manner suggested certain possibilities
that seemed almost too staggering for
poor Perk to digest offhand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gee whittiker jewsharps! Jack—what’s this
you’re hintin’ at, ol’ pal—give it to me easy-like,
so I c’n swaller it—all in bills—mostly
fresh ones at that—not seen much handlin’
around—say, are you tryin’ to tell me they’re
every one five dollar bills,—Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon that’s what they are, Perk, I’d say,
from taking a quick look at the same.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bad currency—counterfeits—bogus stuff, er—what?”
gasped the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look for yourself, and you’ll recognize them
as having been printed from the same plates as
the one we’re carrying with us as a sample of
Slippery Slim’s best work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Je-ru-salem crickets! I’m knocked silly for
a fact,” whimpered Perk; and then, as if mustering
up his vanishing stamina he went on to add:
“but however could they’ve got right there under
that brick—conjurer’s black magic, looks
like to me, partner, it sure does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nonsense! that part of it is easy enough to
figure out,” asserted Jack, as usual very matter-of-fact;
“the only thing that seems to border on
the miraculous is our running across this packet
of all the people in the Far West—it looks to
me as if some sort of Destiny might be handling
the cards—that all we have to do is to keep moving
and everything’s bound to come our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure does seem like a snap, and that’s a fact,”
agreed Perk, calming down a little as he began
to grow more accustomed to the great discovery
that had resulted from their deciding to drop
down, and have a sociable cup of hot coffee;
“but I’ll be danged if I c’n make head or tail
out o’ this happening—now, what under the sun
did anybody want to stick that wad o’ long green
under the same adobes, I’d like to know, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! there might be any number of answers
to that question, Perk; for instance didn’t we
learn that it was the habit of Slim, or one of his
busy bees, to jump across the border every little
while with a load of the flimsy, and dole the stuff
out to a number of agents he has working with
him in this section of the country, also all the
way over to Los Angeles and San Diego?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was the spiel they gave us, for a fact,
boss,” admitted Perk, wagging his head eagerly,
as though he felt certain clever Jack would be
able to figure things out, and hit on some sort of
explanation that would cover these mysterious
happenings.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, this, then, might be one of his hidden
<i>caches</i>—at certain times this unknown agent
hides some <i>real</i> money in such a hole as this, and
comes along another dark night it might be to
pick up the big wad that was left in exchange
for the small one he contributed. And that is
the way the game runs, so I was told.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“By gum! but what grand luck for us to come
in on this deal, Jack—pretty soft, I’d call it,
and neither of us had any hand in it either—just
hit on this little bank by sheer chance! Goin’
to crib the loot, are you, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack scratched his head as though certain
plans were flitting through it, and he must make
a choice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, we have to start somewhere, you understand,
Perk, and it looks like the finger of
Fate might be pointing right at this shack, and
telling us to get busy and pick up a strong clue
that, if followed up, would take us straight to
that hideout Slim’s got across in Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess I see what you mean now, brother,”
ventured Perk, his face lighting up with extreme
joy; for he felt they were already on the track,
and that from that hour there must be rapid
action continuously. “If so be that ’ere critter
that slams out these bills on greenhorns and
come-ons is gettin’ anxious to see what sorter
prize he’s drawn in the lottery, why, he might
jest come along any ol’ time now, since the
storm’s over an’ there’s nawthin’ to hold him up.
Got any idea he’s nigh due here, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shouldn’t be a bit surprised if he walked in
on us any time,” ventured Jack; and then, seeing
the puzzled look on his chum’s rugged face
he went on to add: “I didn’t mention the fact
but while we were making our way over from
the ship I felt certain I glimpsed several far-off
lights, as if they might be in windows of cabins
or houses of some sort. Then, too, I surely did
hear a big dog barking, and something like a
rooster crowing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I’ll be jiggered if you ain’t got sharper
ears than I c’n boast, Jack, ol’ hoss, which ain’t
no lie either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t you believe it, Perk; it just happened
that you were so wrapped up in thinking of that
coffee treat you didn’t pay as much attention to
outside things as I did. So it seems as if there
might be some kind of a village or prairie town
not more than two miles from this abandoned
old shack and if that’s so then the chances are
this agent who’s been working the public for
Slim probably lives there. Then again, like as
not he has a pretty good idea about when his
bunch of kale ought to be placed under that
brick—in fact he might have made his way out
here this very night only for the storm threatening.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, partner,” Perk hastened to say, brimful
of energy, “which, bein’ the case, it’s up to
us to lay a sweet little mantrap, so’s to trip him
by the heels if so be he knocks on our door.
How’ll we fetch it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“First of all we’ll finish our supper, and clean
up here,” came the ready explanation; “he may
smell the odor of coffee and bacon, but then you
might expect this shelter to be used once in a
while by Mexican tramps, or passing cowboys,
especially when a big storm threatens, so that
isn’t going to scare the Johnny. As for us, we’ll
fix things so as to give him a nice little surprise,
by hiding out, after making things all dark inside
here, with water thrown on the fire to
smother the hot coals, after which there’s nothing
to do but take things easy until he shows up—if
he does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sabbe, okay, partner; let’s get busy, for
the bacon’s done brown to a turn.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch20' class='c014'>CHAPTER XX <br /> <br />SPRINGING THE TRAP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There was much that must be done before they
could feel satisfied they had their mantrap arranged.
Jack realized that if the party who
played the part of local agent for the counterfeiter
gang had been kept from coming to secure
the fresh supply of bogus bills by the threatening
storm, he was likely to make his appearance
at almost any time, since all danger from the
electrical disturbance was now past.</p>

<p class='c013'>They finished their little supper without
wasting any more time, after which the matter
of hiding all traces of their presence was taken
up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See if you can find any water outdoors,
Perk,” Jack was saying, as he contemplated the
red embers of their late fire. “Seems to me I
stepped in some sort of a puddle while coming
up to the door. Here’s an old rusty can that
looks as if it’d hold a quantity—I want to dash
it on these coals so as to cool them off. That
done we’ll find some way to hide, and watch developments.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk sized up the situation cleverly enough,
and lost no time in setting about doing as his pal
suggested. When he came back he was carrying
the rusty can, which did leak a trifle, but
then that made no particular difference, so long
as enough water remained to put the fire out.</p>

<p class='c013'>It sizzled, and steamed a bit but Perk distributed
the fluid contents of his can with such
discretion that all this was speedily brought to
a finish, with the last red ember cooled off, leaving
a dead little pile of wood ashes as the only
reminder of their blaze.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now that’s settled, partner,” said the always
ready Perk, “what comes next on our program?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had his hand electric torch in use, for
otherwise they must have been left to grope
around, since the clouds continued to drift past
in clusters, shutting out most of the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We must gather up everything here that
might give us away, for like as not the fellow’ll
fetch some kind of a light along with him—lantern
it may turn out to be, because he knows its
apt to be pretty dark inside the old shack, and
he can’t do much just by fumbling around.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! that’s right, boss,” returned Perk,
commencing to gather up any and all their
scanty belongings, not forgetting that convenient
rifle of his. “But I say, how ’bout the bus—won’t
he lamp the thing settin’ there in the open
an’ ain’t it apt to give him a bad start?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had duly considered that very point in
making up his plans, and was ready to meet the
situation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Taken it all in all, buddy, there’s small danger
of that happening,” he went on to tell Perk.
“First, remember, the ship lies on that side of
the shack away from the spot where I glimpsed
those lights and if he comes along in a direct
line from the town there isn’t one chance in three
of him noticing it. Even if he does I reckon
he’ll feel dead certain only his own messenger’d
be flying in this region—he may never have seen
another crate besides the one sent out by Slippery
Slim.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She sounds good to me, Jack an’ I’m willin’
to take a shy at the target, if so be you guess it’s
straight goods, all wool’n a yard wide. Let’s
go!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly both passed out of the deserted
shack that had proved such a fortunate harbor
for them after the late storm. Jack knew what
they must do in following up the little plan he
had framed, with a view of giving the suspect
the shock of his life and without any further
preliminaries he set about carrying out the few
details.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a chink or two in this further wall,”
he went on to say, in a low voice, next door to a
whisper, “that will furnish us means for keeping
tabs on what’s going on inside. We’ll settle down
there, and just wait. As luck has it that side of
the shack is away from the moon, which is all in
our favor, in fact everything seems to be arranged
just to suit our plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bully set-up, boss, couldn’t be better for a
fact,” agreed the hopeful Perk, who firmly believed
in the element of Luck, and was immensely
gratified to discover how that little god
was working over-time in their favor—according
to his way of thinking it was always “better
to be born lucky than rich.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it?” whispered Jack, after they
had commenced to crouch down in the darkened
spot he had selected.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just great, that’s all,” Perk assured him,
“show me where one o’ them cracks c’n be located,
partner, an’ then I’ll be okay—all
fixed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack obliged by directing his chum’s hand to
an opening, through which it would be easy
enough to keep watch over any happening inside
the shack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Next we’ll creep over to this further corner,
and try to find out when he comes along,”
continued Jack. “From now on, Perk, keep
your tongue between your teeth—no talking, remember,
but if it does seem to be absolutely
necessary, put your lips close to my ear, and
whisper—get that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nuff sed, boss, I’m on,” came faintly from
the figure crouching at Jack’s side, after which
abject silence fell upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>A little later on Perk, now that his hearing
was strained so as to pick up any kind of sound,
however slight, caught the barking of a watchdog;
it seemed to be at a considerable distance
from the shack, and he judged there might be a
couple of miles lying between. This was not a
great amount of ground to cover, if only the inducement
were sufficiently urgent and that fat
packet of enticing bank bills, supposed to be
secreted under the adobes of the old hearth, must
represent an alluring prize, capable of drawing
a chap who was fond of “easy money” out of his
snug home at this unseasonable hour of the
night, and indulging in a little hike, for which
effort he would fancy himself well repaid.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some time passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>They lay there just back of the comer of the
dilapidated and abandoned shack, waiting, listening,
and frequently feeling a little thrill when
some soft sound came stealing to their ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Perk plainly heard what was surely a
low cough, such as might be caused by a sudden
tickling in the throat. Some one was undoubtedly
approaching the spot, and coming from the
west, where they understood the prairie hamlet,
or village, lay at the foot of a small ridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>He merely touched his companion’s right arm
to let Jack know something was in the wind.
The cough was repeated, so that Perk chuckled
softly to himself, as if more than ever convinced
that luck was bent on handing them out further
fat plums.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was already creeping back so as to reach
the spot where those convenient peepholes could
be found and of course Perk imitated his example.
Thus it came about they were in complete
readiness to make good use of their eyes
when a slight scratching sound came from
within, and a tiny flash announced that the newcomer
had struck a match.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk could see him there down on his knees,
and intent on applying his lighted match to the
wick of a lantern he had evidently fetched along
for this very purpose. If Perk could have analyzed
the feeling that possessed him just then he
must have compared it to the exultation of a cat
when about to make a jump upon a sparrow,
close up to which he had managed to hide, all
prepared for the finishing act of the ambush.</p>

<p class='c013'>No sooner had the man succeeded in lighting
his lantern than with eager hands he commenced
lifting the adobe under which Jack had again
artfully placed the bait in the shape of that
tempting packet of bogus notes.</p>

<p class='c013'>How eagerly he pounced on the contents of
his queer <i>cache</i>, all the avariciousness of a miser
handling his hoard was displayed and at the
same time he looked hurriedly from one side to
the other, as though his guilty soul, conscious of
having thus broken the law of his country, was
already seeing the long arm of Justice stretching
out menacingly toward him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack evidently had seen enough to satisfy him
the genuine criminal was in focus, and that there
could be no miscarriage of Justice in effecting
his capture with the goods upon him. He was
creeping toward the open door of the shack, evidently
bent on taking the slick partner of the
counterfeiter chief by surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk lost no time in crawling at his pal’s heels,
bent on having a hand in the closing scene of the
little drama—he wanted to see with his own
eyes just how such a slimy beast would take his
“bump” when he found the meshes of the net
closing around him.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon looking in at the open door.
The man still knelt there on the hard earthen
floor of the shack, and appeared to be nervously
fumbling the sheaf of bills, as though trying to
count them, and be assured that he had received
the full amount to which he was entitled—that
there had been no “holdout” attempted.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps one of them happened to make a
slight sound—either that, or else the man’s guilty
soul caused him to fancy he heard something
for he turned his head. It chanced that the
light of the lantern fell full upon his dark face,
and disclosed the distended eyes filled with terror,
as well as the expression so ghastly that
passed athwart his countenance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put ’em up!” commanded Jack, sharply, in
a voice that would brook no nonsense and as if
mechanically influenced to obey, the wretched
trapped distributor of bad notes raised both
hands, the packet falling to the floor as if his
nerveless fingers could no longer retain their
grip.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and Perk stepped blithely into the
lighted shack, the former with his ready automatic
covering the badly shaken rogue, Perk
trailing his rifle in a suggestive way, as if able
to back his boss up on the slightest provocation.</p>

<p class='c013'>First frisking the other, and removing a gun
from his back pocket, Jack made a motion with
his hand as he set Perk to work.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get the bracelets on him, partner, then we’ll
ask him a few leading questions before we make
up our minds what the next step’ll be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But—hold on, Mister,” whined the poor
devil, all aquiver as he groveled there on his
knees; “I ain’t done nawthin’—this hear ain’t
my stuff—I jest suspicioned Jud he must a had
somethin’ hid out this way, ’case he kep’ comin’
an’ agoin’, so I kim tuh see what it mout be. Now
I knows he must a robbed thet bank over in
Tucson when he went off with a gang he runs
with.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stow that gab,” said the disgusted Perk,
“that’s all too flimsy to wash. We got you to
rights an’ where the hair’s short, an’ you’ll have
a chanct to see what the inside o’ the pen at Atlanta’s
like. This here’s counterfeit long-green,
an’ you knows it, mister,” with which cutting
remark he snapped a pair of steel handcuffs
upon the other’s wrists with the skill only one
accustomed to handling such “safety-first” contraptions
could display, proving that for one of
Slippery Slim’s active lieutenants the show was
indeed over.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch21' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXI <br /> <br />PICKING UP CLUES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>By this time the man whom Uncle Sam’s two
clever sky detectives had trapped, showed signs
of being almost in a state of collapse. Too late
did he realize what a terrible mistake he had
made when yielding to the blandishments of
Slippery Slim Garrabrant, and acting under the
belief that he could defy the law and get away
with it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the big idea, partner,” Perk was asking
after he and Jack had fixed things so there
was no possible chance for their prisoner to
break away, and give them the laugh. “Do we
jump off right now, or wait till mornin’, I’d like
to know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No hurry at all,” was the calm reply, “I
want to go over our crate once more before we
start that hop across to the California border,
I’ve good reason to believe things are okay but
a second overhauling will satisfy me better.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I kinder guess you won’t want me to slip
over to this here town, an’ pick up a few fresh
eggs, eh, boss?” and Perk’s voice actually took
on a wheedling vein as he made this remark
for if there was anything he dearly loved along
the line of “eats” it was those same “fresh eggs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack shook his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hardly think it would be wise,” he observed;
“we don’t know the lay of the land for one thing—it
might be this party has some backing among
his neighbors, and we’d find ourselves in a hornets’
nest before we knew what was what. No,
we can stick it out here the balance of the night,
which is pretty well gone right now, and be off
about sunrise.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a lot more stuff around in here that’d
burn right well,” insinuated Perk; “how ’bout
another bit o’ fire—this night air feels some cool
to me an’ ’sides, we’d have a blaze ready so’s to
boil more coffee ’fore we kick off, eh, what,
partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Please yourself so far as that goes, Perk, I
reckon it wouldn’t feel at all bad to have some
fire, as we must hang out here several hours.
But don’t make any noise if you can help it.
Besides, we ought to keep an eye out for trouble,
no telling what this slick chap might work off
on us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! we’ll one o’ us keep watch off’n on,”
promised Perk, starting without any further delay
to gather some fuel, and get a blaze going.</p>

<p class='c013'>While he was thus engaged Jack took their
prisoner in hand, and commenced to grill him.
There was nothing of the dreaded “third degree”
rough-house measures in what Jack attempted
but he tried to show the man where his best interests
lay.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re in a bad fix, my friend,” Jack told
him: “and unless you come clean, so as to help
us round up the balance of your outfit, you’ll
be certain to get the full penalty the law lays
down. We know a whole lot about Slippery
Slim and his ways, and are dead certain we’re
bound to end up his graft before many more
days pass by. So when you’re answering my
questions don’t try to lie to me, for like as not
I’ll be already acquainted with the facts and
know you’re trying to beat around the bush.
Dangerous business, let me tell you; far better
for you to hold your tongue than deceive me.
Come clean, and I promise you I’ll do everything
in my power to have you let off easy, besides no
one need know you’ve turned State’s evidence.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he started in to put pointed questions,
concerning certain points that were vital to his
plans. Once he caught the man squirming under
the lash, and giving an answer that he very well
knew was like “beating around the bush.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know better than that, my friend,” he
told him sharply, “that’s only half a truth you’ve
given me. Don’t try it again if you know what’s
good for your health, or it’ll be a matter of possibly
ten years before you see your family again.
Stick to the truth, and it may be only a question
of six months you’ll spend at Atlanta behind the
bars. Now tell me again what I wanted to know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He had managed to impress his strong personality
upon the writhing wretch, who was
ready to throw himself unreservedly upon his
mercy and so the answers were given without
hesitation, although in some instances the man
declared he did not know, as he had only once
been across the line and visited Slippery Slim
in his hideout among the Mexican mountains.</p>

<p class='c013'>When Jack realized that he had really pumped
the other dry, he felt he had profited in many
ways and that their sudden determination to
make, a night landing, so as to recover after their
buffeting by the storm, had been a most fortunate
happening indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>For one thing he had learned that the name
of their frightened prisoner was Simeon Hawkins,
and that he had a wife and several children
living in the little prairie town only a few miles
distant—a fact that seemed to give him great
distress, now he found his avaricious dreams
wrecked, and himself in the hands of a couple
of those very same Secret Service detectives
whom the “big boss” had undoubtedly referred
to so contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had been “listening in,” and chuckling
happily whenever he realized his mate had made
some sort of a “ten-strike,” picking up valuable
information that was destined to ultimately
serve their ends wonderfully, and help to “pot
their game.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They sat there for some time, talking in low
tones. The man who lay close by helpless was
silent as a rule, although several times he uttered
a dismal groan, when his feelings overpowered
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess I’ll step out, partner,” remarked Perk
at one time, “an’ slip over to the ship, I’d sure
hate to have some critter do us a bad turn by
meddlin’ with any o’ them dials an’ gadgets.
What I wouldn’t do to <i>him</i> would be a caution,
that’s right.”</p>

<p class='c013'>From the fact that Perk carried his rifle along
with him his meaning was not difficult to understand
and Jack felt sorry for the chap who was
at the other end of the gun sights when his pal
pulled the trigger.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk cautiously approached the grounded
ship, and started when discovering some moving
object just in its shadow. The moon was shining
brightly now, so that it was an easy matter to see
for quite some little distance, although so deceptive
was the light that even sharp-eyed Perk
could hardly have told whether some dark object
seen fifty feet off was a stump or a black dog
sitting there and watching him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Waiting until the object moved again, he discovered
he had been wise to hold his fire, for by
then he had made it out to be some species of
animal. He took several forward steps, whereupon
the beast started to move off, uttering a
little nasty snarl while doing so.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks, on’y a stinkin’ kiote after all, skulkin’
’round to see if he c’n stir up a little grub o’ any
kind. Get out, you varmint!” and he waved his
gun above his head while starting to run forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>This completely demoralized the cowardly
prairie marauder, so that he took to his heels,
and quickly vanished in the near distance. Perk
found everything all right when he gave the
stranded plane “the once over”; and being satisfied
that there was nothing to be feared from a
coyote prowling around in search of a supper or
breakfast, he returned to the shack to report all
well.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was busily engaged making certain notes,
and reading others connected with their present
business, as jotted down in his memorandum
book in a peculiar brand of short-hand all his
own, but which would appear as so much Greek
or Choctaw to any one else.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Better turn in, and get a few winks of sleep,
brother,” he told Perk, who had yawned once or
twice as he sat before the fire. “I’ll wake you up
in about an hour or so when you can take your
turn playing sentinel, until the dawn shows up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just as you say, old hoss,” came the ready
reply; “fact is, I’m a bit drowsy, an’ could get
away with a few winks; but don’t forget to wake
me when the hour’s up, remember.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s all right, partner,” Jack told him,
laughingly; “we’re in this game thirty-thirty,
and you’ll have your turn, depend on it. Now
get busy, and don’t you dare snore above a whisper
either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I do jest gimme a poke, Jack—tryin’ to
break myself o’ that nasty habit but I got to
have help, you know—no feller ain’t wholly responsible
fur what he does when he’s asleep.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In due time Jack aroused the other, and himself
sought a brief period of forgetfulness in
sleep. So the balance of the night passed, and
morning came with a clear sky, and a promise of
decent weather for the continuance of their
flight.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch22' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXII <br /> <br />OVER ARIZONA DESERTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Perk must have dreamed about that hot coffee
treat he had been promising himself, for when
Jack opened his eyes he found his comrade already
watching the bubbling pot, from which
delightful odors were commencing to escape in
the way of steam.</p>

<p class='c013'>They enjoyed quite a decent little breakfast,
what with the ambrosia contained in their aluminum
cups together with some crackers and jam,
after the crisp bacon had been disposed of. Jack
offered some to their prisoner, but the man sadly
shook his head, as if to say he had no appetite
whatever.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was not a bad looking fellow, only with a
weak sort of chin, and evidently built along a
line that could be easily tempted to go wrong if
the inducement were only gilded enough. Jack
felt sorry for him, especially since he had learned
about his family; and was determined to do what
he could so as to get Simeon off, should his information
prove of any value to their cause.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once breakfast was disposed of they all went
over to where the ship lay. By this time Simeon
had found that they really planned to carry him
off with them, a startling fact that added to his
alarm, for apparently he had never been up in
a plane, and a species of stage-fright made him
shake as if he had the ague.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there was no other way to work things,
for should they set him free the chances were
the man, forgetting his promise, would try to
send out some kind of warning to Slippery Slim,
and in the end he and Perk were apt to pay dearly
for their slip-up, perhaps even with their own
lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>When playing such a desperate game with so
canny a lawbreaker it would be the height of
folly to let the dictates of tender hearts turn
them from the path of “safety first,” and Simeon
must continue to “take his medicine,” even
though the innocent ones at home suffered for
his misdeeds—he had never considered others
whom his evil actions had doubtless harmed,
when they found themselves arrested for passing
worthless bills, and how could he expect these
sworn officers of the law to go easy with him
when caught in the act?</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk now began to wonder just how they
would be able to “tote” a third party in the limited
accommodations afforded by the double
cockpit of their ship. It was bound to prove a
tight squeeze, and not so comfortable but then
why grumble on account of a trifle like that,
when Fortune was giving them such a glad hand
all the while?</p>

<p class='c013'>He began to shift things around some while
Jack was busy checking the motor, struts, undergear,
and propeller, with the design of condensing,
and making more room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Funny how you c’n jam things into such a
small compass when you really an’ truly try,”
he told Jack, when he had finished his task. “I
kinder guess I’ll be able to fix him okay, ’cause
he’s no great shakes at size, an’, seems like to
me, he’s shrinkin’ right afore my eyes, he’s that
shaky. Then it’s only for the day, I figger; how
’bout that, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve planned all that out, partner,” he was
told. “As soon as we get over to the California
border we’ll give him in charge of some sheriff
to keep in the hoosgow till we’ve made our killing,
and are ready to deliver the whole batch to
Uncle Sam’s nearest U. S. District Attorney,
at Los Angeles or San Diego. That clear to you,
Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say it was, boss, an’ here’s hopin’ we’ll
get there with both feet when the end shows up,
our prisoners hobbled, an’ with nice new steel
bracelets decoratin’ their wrists. Now to get
the gent aboard the boat, an’ stowed away.
Shucks! he acts like he might be scared out o’ a
year’s growth—some sillies get that way ’bout
goin’ up in a skyscraper the fust time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>His scorn for such a weakling showed in his
face as he helped Simeon to clamber into the
cockpit. The man was as white as a sheet, and
trembling as if expecting to meet with some dire
end in short order, once he left the firm ground
and took to the boundless air. His groans were
heartrending, and Jack felt sorry for the wretch
but for once Perk displayed no signs of sympathy,
it was all so silly in his opinion.</p>

<p class='c013'>He proceeded to take precautions by fastening
the greenhorn in by means of a stout strap which
would prevent his falling out should conditions
necessitate a sudden banking on the part of the
pilot, or a fierce gust of wind cause the ship to
give a unannounced plunge.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All ready, Jack,” announced Perk, after
completing these arrangements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll be with you inside of three minutes,” he
was told, and as the ground ahead had been examined,
and found to be fairly good for the
wheels to trundle over, there seemed to be nothing
more that could be done, only put things to
the test.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was “some rough,” as Perk told himself,
when violently shaken once or twice but they
managed to get up sufficient speed to admit of
Jack lifting her when the right time arrived.
Then they were off, rising like a bird, and almost
immediately opening up the village that nestled
there two miles off, at the foot of the low ridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack headed straight into the west, for that
was their route “as the crow flew.” He cared
not at all that they would pass directly over the
settlement, for few of the people were apt to be
abroad at such an early hour, nor would they
be any the wiser for seeing a plane pass overhead
at such a low altitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, looking down, found himself wondering
which of the modest cottages in line of his vision
chanced to be the home Simeon had spoken of
with such a catch in his voice. The man had
temporarily forgotten about his fears concerning
his own safety, while being carried so high above
the surface of the earth—he was stretching his
neck, and eagerly focussing his staring eyes on
one spot, which evidently held all that he held
dear. Perk ignored his recent sensation of scorn,
and actually felt sorry for the man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor guy,” he was saying under his breath,
though the other could not have heard him had
he shouted at the top of his lungs, on account of
the racket being kicked up by combined motor
and propeller, “he feels right bad ’cause he’s
goin’ off without a chanct to say goodbye. Well,
I on’y hope this will be a lesson to Simeon, an’
he’ll quit playin’ with a buzz-saw, which is the
long arm o’ our Uncle Samuel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon tried his best to keep tabs of the lonely
little hamlet until it was no longer possible to
distinguish objects, owing to the several miles
of distance the speeding plane had covered; then
he fell back in his seat, and let his head drop
on his chest, while his body shook with emotion.
In that dreadful moment he would undoubtedly
have only too gladly given all he had in the wide
world for a chance to undo the wrongs he had
committed in his haste to get rich.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! he orter thought o’ that before, while
the goin’ was good!” was Perk’s comment, who
had seen just such short-sighted men more than
once before in his eventful life, and had a philosophical
mind concerning all such late repentances.
“But I’m sure sorry for them that are
agoin’ to suffer the most—he deserves all he’ll
get, but they’re the innocent ducks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The plane soared along its set course, and as
they were not at more than something like five
thousand feet altitude, Perk could see very well,
when he adjusted the binoculars they carried of
necessity, so as to be able to spy out conditions
before trusting themselves to land, being naturally
a bit suspicious while thus drawing steadily
nearer to what might well be called enemy land.</p>

<p class='c013'>From time to time he found himself gazing
down with considerable curiosity upon scenes
which were mostly foreign to his eyes—he had
only too often scrutinized pictures where uncounted
troops belonging to the enemy were encamped,
or on the march, with monster guns
making the very air quiver with the tumult of
their discharges; where rival pilots came up in
answer to his insulting challenge, to engage him
in deadly combat—he had seen many an unlucky
or less skillful airman go down with his whirling,
blazing coffin, yielding up his life as a tribute
to what he called patriotism—all these and a
multitude of similar thrilling spectacles could
be unrolled in memory as he thus sailed the
azure sky, and saw Jack meet and conquer successive
air pockets lying in wait to give him battle;
and yet this was actually the first time Perk
had ever focussed his gaze upon a genuine cattle
ranch, and saw stock being driven to market,
or it might be mavericks branded; so that he
found himself entranced with the panorama
spread before him as they glided over the prairies
of New Mexico.</p>

<p class='c013'>There cropped up other and like interesting
sights when the wilder sector of country was
reached, with its deep gullies, its bare-topped
mountain peaks—perhaps stretches of desolate
desert where nothing could be seen save billowy
sandy wastes, except possibly patches of yucca,
sage, greasewood, and prickly pear cactus.</p>

<p class='c013'>When, his interest increasing, Perk begged
his comrade to drop down so as to give him a
nearer view of these strange sights, he was able
to increase his knowledge concerning the myriad
of strange sights to be picked up when touring
by air in new territories—now he could make
out the fantastic Joshua trees that seemed to be
engaged in a shimmering dance in the blazing
sunlight; moving shadows that sometimes crossed
the line of his vision he made out to be buzzards
on the wing, circling in search of their carrion
meal; while others on the ground he recognized
as coyotes skulking along, frightened by the sight
and noise coming from far over their heads, and
trying to reach their secret dens in some rocky
canyon or defile.</p>

<p class='c013'>Noon came in due time, with the ship keeping
up its steady grind, and having left hundreds of
miles in its wake.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk began to realize that he had eaten his
breakfast at an unearthly hour, and concluding
that a bite of something, together with a swig of
water from their jug, might go well, he mentioned
the interesting fact that the usual lunch
hour had come, at which Jack nodded his head,
as if to leave all that sort of thing to the discretion
of his trusted pard.</p>

<p class='c013'>So they had a pick-up snack, which was quite
acceptable to the two airmen, able to enjoy their
meals even while cutting capers up among the
clouds. It was another thing to the novice
Simeon, whose appetite had not come back,
though he did manage to swallow a few bites,
and have a drink of cold water to wash things
down. By slow degrees he was getting the upper
hand of his dreadful fears, for while familiarity
could not be said to bring contempt, nevertheless
he was becoming accustomed to the conditions,
and could even display a trace of curiosity
when looking down on some unusually interesting
spectacle to which Perk was pointing so
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>If things continued to exist as they had been
doing all morning it was likely—Jack at one time
told his co-pilot in answer to a question—that
they would be close to the California border by
sunset, or shortly afterwards; since even then
they were well along across Arizona, with fair
skies still beckoning them on their way.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch23' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIII <br /> <br />ON TO THE COLORADO</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Listen, Perk, I’ve got something you should
know—something that hinges on a change of
plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was saying this at a time when, relieved
from the controls he could enter into one of the
little confabs that their use of the ear-phones
allowed. All Perk had to do was to lean forward
and while still handling the stick drink
in whatever his co-pilot chose to say.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! spit it out then, partner,” was his familiar
way of inviting confidence and which
meant so much with those who knew Perk’s peculiar
sayings best.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be sure Simeon Hawkins was sitting close
beside Perk, and what Jack meant to confide in
his running mate could never be intended for
his ears but despite this elbow to elbow touch
there was not the slightest risk of his being able
to pick up a single word, owing to the clamor
kicked up by motor exhaust and propeller.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re going on a bit further than was arranged,”
said Jack, concisely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! meanin’ we don’t pull up when we
strike the border, eh, what, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just that, brother—the going is good, and
we might as well keep moving till we drop down
on the Metropolitan Airport grounds.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whoopee! you mean at Los Angeles, don’t
you, old hoss?” demanded Perk, apparently considerably
surprised by his pal’s bald statement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Righto, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How come, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get this fixed in your noodle,” said the resting
chief pilot—“circumstances often alter cases,
they tell us; well, when we figured on halting at
or near the border, close to the Gila River,
things hadn’t happened such as have hit us since
then.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Meanin’ the storm, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was one thing,” admitted the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Knockin’ us out o’ our reckonin’, like, an’
makin’ us take a forced landin’ on the open
prairie where we run across that flimsy ol’ shack—does
that cover what you mean, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“After a fashion it does,” the other told him,
adding: “like the play of Hamlet, with Hamlet
left out, it falls flat. You omitted the chief reason
for my making this change in plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess you must mean Simeon here, eh
boy?” asked Perk, as if suddenly waking up to
the fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing—what are we going to do with
<i>him</i>, tell me, Perk? It’d be impossible for us
to lug him everywhere we mean to go, flying
across into Mexico, and baiting the wolf in his
own lair, as you might say. He’d be a constant
hindrance to our being free to act besides, we’d
run a fat chance of having him give us away,
just when we thought it was all over but the
shouting.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, Jack—it means you don’t trust his
promises to lend us a helpin’ hand, and goin’
back on his pals—ain’t that the idea?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it,” replied Jack, never bothering
to drop his voice a particle, knowing as he did
that without the aid of those valuable ear-phones
Simeon, humped up against the side of Perk,
could not have caught what was said even
though it had been shouted at the top of his
voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what then, partner?” continued Perk,
apparently still groping in the dark.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing to hinder our tripping right along
till we fetch up at Angeles, when we can find a
way to hand him over to the Federal agents located
there. He’s connected with the big gang
against which Uncle Sam’s declared war to the
knife; and as a material witness, ready to turn
State’s evidence, they’ll be only too well pleased
to hold him <i>incommunicado</i>, so he can’t do a
thing to warn the bunch the big push is on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Okay, Jack. Sounds mighty good to me,
you bet. I’d never a cudgeled my brains enough
to hatch up an idea like that; takes you to think
o’ clever dodges, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then we’ll consider it settled, eh, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just what we will,” came the confident reply.
“’Bout when ought we raise the last beacon
on the road to Angeles, an’ lamp the field
lights at that same Metropolitan Airport?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! if everything goes well, you might call
it along toward midnight,” Jack assured him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got aplenty o’ gas to carry on that far, I’d
guess?” hazarded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s to be hoped so,” said Jack; “because
there’s some mighty tough stretches of country
between the Colorado and the big Pacific city.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! so I understand, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And it would be a bad job for us if we had
to hit the ground where you couldn’t scrape up
a decent landing place with a fine-tooth comb.
When I take the stick again, Perk, maybe you’d
better have a look in, so’s to get tabs on our fuel
tank, and tell me how it stands. From the dial
finger yonder I figure we’ll have a lot more than
enough to see us through.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s right, boss,” affirmed Perk, after casting
a hasty glance at the tell-tale figures so
plainly marked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That settles it then,” with which remark
Jack showed by his actions that further conversation
was needless.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Simeon sat there through it all, never
once dreaming how his fate was being so calmly
settled; doubtless he imagined the consultation
had been about something connected with the
running of the cloud-chaser, and covered facts
such as would have been all Greek to him, even
had he been able to listen in.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was not at all bothered by this change
of plans on the part of the head pilot—it mattered
little when they managed to drop down at
the airport—chances were the ground lights
were kept on full through the whole of each
night, since air mail planes would be apt to
come and go, some of them having been thrown
out of their regular schedules by dense mountain
fogs, or head winds that cut down the customary
speed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, also, was well acquainted with the
courtesy to be encountered at all such well conducted
flying fields, where every one would be
eager to do whatever was possible for the comfort
of those who chose to visit such ports, and
show little or no undo curiosity connected with
the reason for their coming.</p>

<p class='c013'>True, they might turn out to be a bit short
with the “eats;” but Perk, who knew the ways
of his pal so well, felt certain Jack would see to
it they had a chance to “fill up” as soon as they
could strike an open restaurant, of which there
should be no lack in such a wide-open city as
Los Angeles, with its sporty crowds at Hollywood.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was moving on apace, and
there cropped up fresh thrilling sights every little
while, for Perk to stare at through his useful
glasses. They were following the course of
the famous Gila River toward its confluence
with the still better known Colorado, which
hundreds of miles further north passed through
the Grand Canyon country, most majestic in a
panorama sense of any region on the face of the
globe.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along about nightfall they might expect to
pass over Yuma, located close to the junction of
the two rivers. Perk wondered once or twice
why his pal had not decided to land there, and
turn the prisoner over to some one in authority;
but he felt certain Jack had good reasons for
not attempting this.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe, now,” Perk told himself, with Jack
again running the ship, while he attended to
some of his own manifold duties; “he
guessed there might be a bad crowd at Yuma—fellers
apt to be in cahoots with the same
gang o’ daredevils Simeon here was connected
with; and who might even try to effect his escape,
so as to shut his trap—even go so far as to
knife the poor skunk to make sure he didn’t
peach. Oh! yeah, that’s the way Jack looked
at it, bet your boots it must be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Soon afterwards the sun gave notice that it
was about to withdraw behind the line of mountains
lying toward the west. Jack had his bearings,
and expected to be able to pick up the flash
beacons arranged for the convenience of the air
mail corps in their night flights to and from Los
Angeles. So thoroughly has this all been
mapped out, with the signals to be found about
every ten miles, that a pilot can see as many as
three ahead at one time, depending on the altitude
at which he may be flying.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such wise precautions had been taken that
would make night flying just as safe and easy as
during the daytime one thing only cropping up
from time to time to raise trouble, and cause delay
was the presence of the fogs that were apt
to rise from the deep canyons, to blot out those
friendly gleams of flashing light marking the
air mail course from start to finish.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch24' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIV <br /> <br />SIMEON GROWS DESPERATE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was commencing to grow dusk when they
sighted the lights of Yuma, that town on the railroad
leading to Los Angeles. Such a thing as a
plane flying overhead was so common these modern
days as to hardly excite any comment—they
came and went, with seldom anything out of the
usual taking place although not so very far
away, among the mountains, one of the most
dreadful of all air tragedies known to the annals
of flying had taken place, when the great
liner <i>City of San Francisco</i>, lost in a storm,
struck head-on against a rocky cliff, shattering
the ship and causing the death of every one of
those aboard, some seven souls in all.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now they had left Yuma far in their rear, and
Jack was watching to pick up the first flash beacon
on the way to the Coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>The weather continued to favor them, the
heavens being almost devoid of any semblance of
clouds, and the air quite cool at the height they
maintained while heading into the beckoning
west.</p>

<p class='c013'>Over deserts and mountainous stretches they
kept swinging along, to the constant accompaniment
of the customary chorus of a bustling plane
threading the mighty air lanes of the skies. The
silvery stars came out in battalions to sprinkle
the azure heavens like innumerable bright lanterns,
such as could be seen in Old Japan during
carnival times.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was the life, Perk told himself again and
again, sitting there after he had munched his
scanty portion of their meagre supper, Simeon
having again declined to share with them—what
air pilot who has tasted of the joys of such hours
could ever dream of forsaking his vocation, so
long as Fortune allowed him to retain his vision,
hearing, and the faculty for guiding an onrushing
ship through the realms of unlimited space—not
he for one, Perk assured himself, drawing in
huge draughts of the clear air, and watching the
wonderful beacons as they passed them by,
threading the pathway of the stars as it were,
straight toward their distant goal.</p>

<p class='c013'>The night wore on, with the voyagers making
splendid progress.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had made no miscalculation when saying
he believed they would fetch up at their destination
somewhere about the midnight hour; for
it still lacked more or less of that time when in
the near distance they glimpsed lights telling
that the city, and its nearby aviation field, must
be close at hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they found themselves circling over the
port, which, just as Jack had fancied would be
the case, was lighted most brilliantly. Even as
they sighted the field they noted a ship settling
down, evidently an air mail plane that had
been held up by some dense fog belt which they
had fortunately missed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Soft snap I’d call it, droppin’ down with all
them field lights to show the ground, so a feller
c’n see a rock the size o’ a baseball,” was what
the tickled Perk was telling himself while Jack
was proceeding to make the terminal drop, with
several ground attendants hurrying up so as to
lend any assistance needed.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had received his instructions from Jack,
and removed the handcuffs from the wrists of
the prisoner. There was no necessity for letting
everybody know the facts and the sight of a
man wearing steel bracelets, and gripped by an
attendant never fails to excite keen curiosity with
most people and especially would this be the
case if he had just come by the air route from
some unknown and therefore mysterious quarter.</p>

<p class='c013'>He would keep his arm through that of
Simeon, and inform him in a forcible whisper
that should he attempt any “funny business” it
would be at the risk of being shot down without
further warning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack would attend to everything necessary,
such as having their crate stowed away in some
convenient hangar, where it could be recovered
at any time, by paying such charges as were
customary.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be sure Perk was questioned by several of
the men while Jack saw that the ship was being
taken care of but when he chose, Perk could keep
a still tongue in his head and since he paid no
attention to what was said, and never opened his
mouth in the least, possibly they concluded he
must be both deaf and dumb.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk may have chuckled deep down in his
throat when he heard a few of the disgusted
remarks some of the men exchanged concerning
his lack of speech and hearing but
he kept his own counsel; and in the end Jack
came up saying he had secured a taxi to carry
them to a small hotel down in the heart of the
city, recommended by one of the hostlers who
seemed to know what he was talking about.</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon had looked a bit anxious, as though
wondering how their arrival at Los Angeles
would affect his wretched fortunes but he made
no attempt to appeal to the crowd for help.
Undoubtedly he was firmly convinced that the
grim Perk must be a man of his word, and that
any attempt on his part to break away would
prove a most serious matter indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah!” Perk was telling himself under his
breath when he took note of this humble disposition
on the part of Simeon, “Guess now he feels
it’s a heap better to be a live fool than a dead
hero; an’ by jinks I don’t blame the beggar for
thinkin’ thataways either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon all three safely lodged in the
taxi—which fortunately had remained up to this
late hour, the driver hoping to pick up a fare—and
heading for the nearby city.</p>

<p class='c013'>Later on they entered the small hotel, and
found it all the obliging ground attache at the
port had said. Jack registered the party, all of
them under fictitious names, since it paid to exercise
due caution when on the track of big game
just as it would for the big game hunter to make
no sound when advancing upon an enormous
tusker or “rogue” elephant whose spoor he had
been trailing through forest and jungle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Would it be possible for us to have some
supper sent up to our room?” Jack asked the
night clerk who shrugged his shoulders as if
dubious concerning his ability to accommodate
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kindly try to have it done, if double price
will have any effect,” continued Jack, using his
most gracious smile that usually accomplished
his purpose and at that the clerk responded by
saying he would do his best but it was of course
most unusual, and he hoped they would not make
any complaint if the variety was not all they
might wish.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quantity is the chief thing that interests
us,” said Jack; “you see, we have come
by air, and fell short of food while on our way,
so that my two pals here are very near being
starved; so whatever you send make it a fairly
bountiful spread, please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they were shown to their room, which
contained a double bed and a cot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I kinder guess now, partner,” said Perk, after
flashing a glance around the apartment, fronting
on a back lot, though up in the third story of the
building, “you an’ me better share the bed, while
Simeon gets his little nap on the sofy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That goes, Perk,” his comrade told him
“and after we’ve had supper we’ll hit the hay.
After such a broken night as we had back a ways
some sleep ought to be welcome, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! hope we don’t have to wait too tarnel
long for the grub,” Perk was saying, dismally
rubbing his stomach, as if to show how flat it
seemed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack engaged him in conversation of a general
character, just to keep his mind from dwelling
on the subject of eating for once Perk let himself
believe he was in danger of famishing and
he just could not subside but must commence
to marshal all the known dishes of which he was
especially fond, and keep on taunting and tantalizing
himself by stringing them off as might a
glib-tongued waiter in any restaurant.</p>

<p class='c013'>After quite a tiresome wait there was a knock
at the door, which Perk hastened to answer.
Two waiters strode in, bearing trays laden
with a pretty substantial assortment of food—quite
a satisfactory display, Jack thought, considering
the late hour, and that probably the regular
kitchen force must have long ago turned in
or else gone home.</p>

<p class='c013'>The table fairly groaned under the assortment—Perk
pertinently mentioned the fact,
adding that he guessed he’d do his share of
groaning <i>after</i> he had finished his supper which
Jack did not doubt in the least, having a knowledge
concerning the other’s vast appetite, and
unbridled disposition to make a pig of himself
at such times when food was plentiful.</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon Hawkins was coaxed to sit down with
them and as his state of mind seemed to have
improved quite a little, he also partook of food
of which he most certainly was much in need,
having fasted so long and abstemiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>When this ceremony had been carried through
to a finish, the supply of visible victuals had been
wonderfully reduced; and even Perk was heard
to declare he could not eat another bite, which
meant he was like a stuffed turkey, fit for the
Thanksgiving table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before turning in, Perk took occasion to “talk
like a Dutch uncle,” as he termed it, to Simeon,
assuring him he need not be in too upset a state
of mind concerning his future, since Jack had
said he was bound to do all he could to have him
let go, because of what he had confided to them,
and such assistance he would be able to lend the
Government in convicting the head men of the
lawless conspiracy along the counterfeiting line.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other nodded his head as though he
understood that, having embarked in the game
of throwing down Slippery Slim, he realized
there was nothing else for him to do but go
through to the windup.</p>

<p class='c013'>So confiding Perk, thinking things would run
smoothly, took off some of his outer garments,
and rolled into bed, as it afterwards turned out,
happily choosing that side of the same nearest
to the windows of their room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack soon followed, and the last thing he noticed
ere snapping off the light was the humbled
Simeon wrapped in a blanket, and lying there
flat on his back, as though meaning to get what
sleep he could during that fragment of the night
still remaining.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was, so far as appearances went, sound
asleep; but then sometimes things are not just
what they seem. To tell the truth, Perk had
made up his mind ere lying down that he would
“sleep with one eye open,” as he called it, meaning
it was his intention to keep on the alert, ready
to jump out of bed at the least sign of trouble.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps when he thus decided it was with a
hazy idea they might have some sort of unwelcome
visitor during the night; he could not just
decide how this could be but then those unprincipled
agents of the counterfeiter king—like
the fellow who had rifled the belongings of
Scotty, the air mail pilot in Atlanta—were liable
to turn up anywhere, everywhere, when least expected,
and try to manipulate their bold games.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hearing some sort of sound as of a person
moving, Perk suddenly sat straight up in bed,
to see their prisoner in the act of crawling over
the sill of the nearby window, evidently bent on
giving them the slip!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch25' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXV <br /> <br />THE STAGE SET FOR BATTLE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Hey! you, lay off that stuff!” was the way
Perk exploded, even as he made a wild dash
across the floor, and clutched the reckless Simeon
by the arm, dragging him back into the room
by sheer strength.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other struggled but feebly perhaps he
was really horrified at the desperate chances he
had been about to take.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, you must be goofy, Hawkins, to try that
sort o’ game!” Perk went on scornfully,
as the wretched man writhed on the floor where
he had flung him. “Don’t you know it’s two
stories down to the roof o’ that extension; an’
chances are you’d a got a broken neck, or leg,
in the drop. Better make up your mind to take
the medicine an’ stand it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack of course had been aroused at the first
movement of his chum, and sat up in bed watching
the actions of the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Trying to take leg bail, was he, Perk?” he
remarked. “You can hardly blame the poor
dick, come to think of it because he’s rubbing
up against a tough proposition. Better put the
bracelets on him again, and tie his ankles together
he might get loco, and try to jump out
of a window, just to end it all and that would
be too bad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon, utterly cowed and silent, made no resistance
when Perk followed out his pal’s advice.
There were several hours of the night still remaining,
and they might as well secure such
sleep as lay in their power, since no one could
predict what sort of strenuous activity awaited
them in the near future.</p>

<p class='c013'>Came morning, and the two air detectives
were stirring.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another right fine mornin’ for us,” Perk remarked,
blithely, as he looked out of the window,
and made a grimace at seeing what a nasty
drop had awaited the desperate prisoner had he
succeeded in carrying out his plan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! that’s the usual program, I understand,
out here on the Coast,” Jack told him. “Hardly
ever see any rain in this blessed country; that’s
why they have to depend on irrigation for their
crops.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Plenty to keep us hoppin’ today, I kinder
guess, partner, eh, what?” volunteered Perk, as
he started dressing, after removing the stout
cords that had been wrapped about the lower
limbs of the Federal prisoner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never said truer words, boy,” Jack
added “got to settle about this business of having
our friend here held until the gate’s been
crashed, and our scoop put through. Then I
mean to have a good talk with several people in
the Government offices, who can give us a few
points that so far we’ve been missing. You can’t
pick up too much information when aiming to
stack up against smart lads like this Slippery
Slim. He’s got so many eyes on the watch the
chap who expects to corral <i>him</i> must get up right
early in the morning, and pull the wires in a
dozen different directions. I’d a heap rather
overdo the matter of taking precautions than to
let just one ragged end get loose, for a game like
this is only as strong as its weakest link.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do we eat here, or look up a restaurant?”
asked Perk, quite naturally, since it was the
easiest thing in the world for his thoughts to
turn toward the subject of catering to the loud
demands of his stomach, when the usual time
for meals came around.</p>

<p class='c013'>“On the whole I reckon it’d be as well for us
to stick around, and have breakfast fetched up
here,” suggested jack. “I’ll step down presently,
and see if it can be managed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just as you say, partner,” Perk told him,
grinning, to add: “Make her two fried eggs and
a rasher o’ bacon for me; also a big cup o’ coffee
with a stack o’ wheats done brown. Say, you
might add some toast, and an orange, seein’ that
this is California, an’ a feller ought to patronize
the fruit industry when happenin’ to visit the
Coast country. Guess that ought to fill a vacuum
okay, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Leave it to me, Perk, and you’ll never starve
to death I’m a good provider, and Uncle Sam
foots the chuck wagon bill.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When later on two waiters appeared laden
down with a mass of dishes, Perk grinned some
more, and looked quite joyous; for the odor of
coffee and bacon always pleased his sense of smell
as nothing else could.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Simeon had apparently about decided to
make the best of a bad bargain, for he began
sniffing as though the idea of breakfast appealed
to him—he certainly needed something to brace
him up.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along about ten o’clock they prepared to set
out for the offices of the Federal forces in Los
Angeles. Simeon had finally given his word not
to make any further attempt at escape. Jack had
been talking seriously with the fellow ever since
breakfast, trying to squeeze further information
from him, and holding out hope that if he “came
clean” he might yet be allowed to go back to his
family after the Government had made use of
him to send the leaders in the wide flung conspiracy
to prison for long terms.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again a convenient taxi was called upon to
convey the trio to their intended destination.
Both Jack and Perk evinced considerable curiosity
concerning the unfamiliar sights on the
streets. They asked numerous questions of the
driver, who chanced to be a communicative sort
of fellow, and filled them up with information
about the sunny queen city of the Coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not long before Jack’s magical passport,
sanctioned by the Big Boss at Washington,
brought them in contact with several high officials
who apparently had been secretly apprized
of their presence in the West, and had
also been requested to afford the two daring sky
detectives all the assistance possible in carrying
out their plan of campaign.</p>

<p class='c013'>So it came about that Simeon was taken off
their hands, after the story of his capture had
been told. Jack secured a promise that the man
would be lightly dealt with because of the valuable
aid he had already afforded the sleuth-hounds
of the air branch of the Law.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both of them shook hands with the pitiful
looking chap as he was taken away by a marshal
who had been summoned and who would see
that he was kept aloof from all other prisoners
until his testimony was wanted in court.</p>

<p class='c013'>After that they fell into a general talk, Jack
telling the deeply interested officials about the
stirring adventures befalling himself and Perk
since they first struck Atlanta, where the drive
really had its beginning.</p>

<p class='c013'>In return he was given such information as
had been gathered in connection with more recent
happenings along the line of Slippery Slim’s
operations and the fact of the matter was there
always seemed to be fresh outbreaks of the bogus
money disease in this or that part of the whole
Southwest, as new agents started to work virgin
territory until by this time the greatest unrest
and uneasiness existed among all Government
ranks.</p>

<p class='c013'>The balance of that day the two pals put in
taking a look around the city, visiting Hollywood,
and seeing a number of movie stars whom
they recognized from familiarity with their faces
on the silver screen at various times.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack paid another visit to Federal Headquarters
on the succeeding day, to gather up all
loose ends, and decide on his plans while Perk
took himself off to look up some old friend, who,
he understood, was making good in one of the
new big pictures.</p>

<p class='c013'>They met again late in the afternoon, with
Perk displaying signs of nervous tension for
almost the first thing he said to his chum was in
the shape of a leading question, which Jack undoubtedly
anticipated, knowing Perk’s headlong
nature as he did, and the habit of the other for
seeking speedy action.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wal, what’s the good word, old hoss—when
do we skip out from here, if so be it’s all set?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No more hanging fire, brother,” Jack assured
him, smilingly “we’re loaded for bear this time,
sure pop. I’ve been out at the airport, and had
a full tank of gas put aboard the crate as well
as all that stuff you sent over so’s to keep us from,
starving to death.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bully boy!” crowed the delighted Perk; “jest
can’t come any too soon to please me. I’m only
cravin’ a chanct for a set-to with the head o’ this
flim-flam bunch, who’s laughed at the Government
boys just once too often. Is it tonight,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Midnight ought to see us several hundred
miles on our way, if all goes well,” Jack told
him, not displaying any outward signs of jubilation
himself, although he undoubtedly must be
thrilled by the thought of how they were now
about to put everything to the test, and match
their wits against that astute schemer, for whom
the Federal prison doors were yawning so widely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never gimme sweeter words, old pal!”
Perk was saying, backed up by one of his most
hideous grins.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch26' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVI <br /> <br />ON THE FACE OF THE MOON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Jack proved as good as his word, for they were
off shortly after nightfall, and headed almost
due east. No one at the aviation field had the
remotest idea as to who they were, what their
destination might be, and whence they came.
But then this particular port was becoming a
very important link in the trans-continental
chain, with lines of great passenger and freight
airships going and coming not to mention the
several speedy air mail boats that covered their
hundreds of miles day or night and as a rule on a
schedule that seemed as perfect as that of any
train time table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was unusually silent, at least for him.
Perhaps he was realizing at last the serious
nature of the job they had undertaken—that it
was rather a weighty proposition, such as was
bound to require all their united reserve force
to put across.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still, he had absolute confidence in Jack’s
ability to swing the undertaking, and also refused
to allow anything like doubt to assail him
with regard to their united courage.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was by this time well understood that the
climax, when it came, would occur on Mexican
soil for now that all accounts from every quarter
were in hand, they knew absolutely that the den
of the counterfeiting gang was in a secret cave
among the mountains of Sonora also that the
sagacious Slim had bought protection from certain
local Mexican officials, who were suspected
of secretly plotting a new revolution, and took
this means for obtaining the money needed to
purchase arms in the States.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was even said that Slim never flew back to
his headquarters without loading his swift plane
with a dead weight of guns and ammunition as
the price he had to pay for being allowed to operate
undisturbed on foreign soil.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A pretty kettle of fish, I’d call that sort o’
game,” Perk had indignantly asserted, when he
learned of this see-saw method of currying favor
with the plotting generals who hoped to once
again turn the country upside-down and kick
the present rulers out of office, as well as seize
the city banks with their rich booty.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so it was, but Jack realized how it accounted
for the long spell of immunity Slim had
enjoyed while he lined his pockets, and spread
that financial panic throughout the Southwestern
States. There never had been his equal as a skillful
worker and bold lawbreaker; one who knew
how to set neighbor against neighbor, and make
every one work so that he could rake off a heavy
dividend from each separate deal.</p>

<p class='c013'>So he had for a long time been coming and
going, crossing the border, as a rule by the air
route, carrying his cargoes of deceitful bank bills
to various distributing points—like the one Jack
and Perk had struck by sheer accident—gathering
the genuine stuff contributed by his numerous
dupes, and leaving bulky packages of the wonderfully
executed spurious notes in exchange.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a veritable Golconda for the industrious
worker, who, safe from interference, had kept
as busy as the proverbial bee, that stores honey
day after day.</p>

<p class='c013'>They followed the line of swirling beacons
the air mail boys were in the habit of trailing,
since by this means they could pass some of the
numerous danger spots on their route. In good
time Jack expected to turn his back on these
friendly flashing lights and head due south, to
cross the border, and fly over foreign territory.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had been placed in possession of certain
secret documents issued by the Mexican government,
which proved how they knew of the unholy
alliance made between Slim, the counterfeiter
king, and those traitorous generals who yearned
for fresh outbreaks so as to pamper their own
personal fortunes, just then at low ebb.</p>

<p class='c013'>There existed something of an arrangement,
whereby the Mexican government agreed to
stand back of any effort made by the Department
at Washington to capture Slim, smash his gang
that was widening its powers every day, and
clean out the mess of near-bandits with whom he
had allied himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>If it were necessary all arrangements had been
made whereby Colonel Jose Morales, with a
crack regiment of hard fighting regulars who
had seen much bloody service in bringing the
defiant Yaqui Indians to terms by invading their
mountain fastnesses, and meeting them hand-to-hand—was
stationed within a day’s ride of the
ravine where Slim had his plant and could be
summoned by means of certain smoke signals.
No sooner would these “talking smokes” be detected
than the order would be given “boots and
saddles,” with the mounted regiment in full
swing for the debatable ground where Slim had
his nefarious nest.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, too, had a secret arrangement been effected
with the old leader of the now defunct Texas
Rangers, most of whom were in the service of the
Government connected with the border patrol
and orders had been given the former gallant
hero that if a certain message were received, no
matter by what method, he was to gather a squad
of his old fighters, and cross the border, sure of
being warmly received by the loyal Mexican
troops who would welcome his assistance in wiping
out the sore spot that had been so long a blot
on their country’s honor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus it would seem that everything possible
had been done toward striking a telling blow.
It only remained for Jack Ralston to start the
ball rolling, when it must gain fresh impetus
with every revolution.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk acted as though decidedly pleased when
later on he discovered that they no longer followed
the flashing beacon trail—Jack had gone
as far as was judicious along that line and now
headed straight into the mysterious south, toward
the border of the neighboring republic where
disorder still held sway, and disgruntled chiefs
continued to plot against the rule of the recently
elected president.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every mile traversed now was bringing them
closer to their goal, and Perk found more or less
joy in picturing the thrilling climax, when they
would give Slippery Slim the surprise of his
life—if only no leak concerning their clever plan
had come about.</p>

<p class='c013'>The moon had risen, and was hanging there
in the east, a silvery shield with one edge clipped
off telling that the queen of the night was already
well past her “full” stage and running for
a fall.</p>

<p class='c013'>All at once Perk had an electric shock.</p>

<p class='c013'>He leaned convulsively forward and gripped
his mate by the shoulder, at the same time pointing
toward the southeast and shouting through
the head phones:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look, oh look—see what’s passing across the
moon, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then just as suddenly did he release his clutch,
to fall back in his seat, and exclaim most dramatically,
with a touch of disgust in his voice:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! It’s slipped past, dang the luck!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But I got it all right, Perk,” the pilot assured
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it <i>was</i> a ship, an’ my lamps didn’t fool
me, partner?” Perk cried in renewed excitement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As sure as you’re born, that’s what it was,
brother,” Jack added.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Headin’ south, same as we’re doin’ right now,
eh, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, buddy—just what the crate was
doing, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the answer—could it a been <i>him</i>, on
his way back home with a load o’ machine guns,
life they say he carries every time he crosses the
border, after takin’ out a freshly printed batch
o’ his flimsy stuff to soak on the honest folks back
home?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s something we can only make a stab
at,” replied Jack. “Chances lean that, way, I
must say; but just the same it might have been
some mail plane that’s got blown off its regular
course, and is beating it for the home port. Then
again I understand the border patrol are handling
a few ships in their line of intercepting flyers
making a business of smuggling Chinese aliens
across the line night-times.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d give a heap to know the answer to that
puzzle,” continued Perk, who disliked enigmas,
and all that sort of thing calculated to make a
fellow lie awake nights, bothering his poor
brains. He never had been fitted by Nature for
the job of being a real detective.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll never know,” his pal told him, “unless
it happens we run afoul of the other crate when
our courses draw closer together and if it’s Slim
whose fingers grip that stick we’d rather be excused
for having that happen—our job is to fetch
him back <i>alive</i>, and not make him lose his life
in a crash.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me, I ain’t peticular just what <i>does</i> happen
to the slick guy,” Perk wound up the little talkfest
by saying. “Only, when it comes to a real
showdown either Slim or us got to go to the
wall—dead or alive, the thing’s goin’ to be settled
for keeps!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch27' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVII <br /> <br />THE SIERRA MADRE CHAIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Another thing Perk noticed—this was the fact
that Jack seemed to have changed his mind with
regard to making haste for the ship was racing
along at top-notch speed, as though engaged
in a race with some unseen rival.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hey! what’s the big idea, Jack?” he called
out, when this thing had been going on for some
time, and his burning curiosity could no longer
be held in leash. “Why doin’ the sprintin’ act,
I’m awonderin’?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Less chance for us to run foul of that other
boat if we forge well ahead, don’t you see, partner?”
exclaimed the pilot, sententiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! that’s a fact,” returned the enlightened
Perk. “An’ then mebbe it’d be jest as well for us
to get there ahead o’ the boss in the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m aiming to do that,” he was told.
“It happens that we can’t keep on in the boat till
we strike close to his hideout—the racket would
stir the whole bunch up like a hornet’s nest you’ve
kicked when going through the brush, with the
mad critters swarming out to tackle you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you now, Big Boss—never did think
o’ that before. Then I kinder guess we’ll
have to hike some little way,” and there was a
vein of chagrin in the speaker’s voice as he mentioned
this fact, since walking and Perk never
did seem to agree very well—like most flyers he
had been spoiled for all manner of pedestrianism
by his ability to cover such vast distances
without moving his pedal extremities an iota.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s our sure enough program,” Jack told
him, doubtless thinking that the delayed knowledge
might allow his pal to make up his mind
about swallowing the bitter medicine without a
single grimace.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not long after this little break when
Jack again spoke:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve a good idea we’re across the line now,
partner,” was the information he passed along.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sounds good to me, okay,” commented Perk,
with a tinge of solid satisfaction visible in his
voice as though having a possible rough-house
job to handle, the sooner he got busy the sooner
it was likely to be over.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And making more than an even hundred
miles to the hour in the bargain, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some punkins about comin’ in swell on the
last lap, this crate sure is, I’d say, partner.
Licketty split she humps along like a reg’lar
witch. I guess now she’d make rings around
that ol’ boat Slim’s got hold o’ though it
answers his purpose seems like. But see here,
Jack, you never did tell me jest how you got word
to that same Colonel Morales down here in
Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was given my instructions, and sent a telegram
to him at Hermosilla, in care of Padre
Lopez, giving him the order he was expecting—during
the last hour we were in Los Angeles.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! then the sojers must be in the saddle
right now!” burst out Perk, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If the arrangement went through without a
miss that’s like enough a fact,” admitted Jack;
“the way my plan’s arranged everything must go
off with the regularity of machine work, each
separate part dovetailing, so as to work in full
sympathy. If anything lags, and goes amiss, it’s
apt to throw the whole scheme out of gear, you
understand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! I grab what you mean, partner,” said
the astounded Perk; “but I got to hand it to you
when it comes to hatchin’ up big things—it’s jest
wonderful how you manage. An’ I sure do hope
everything’ll slide along like greased lightnin’,
once it gets started.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had planned to drop down in some isolated
spot where with the coming of dawn, with
the aid of the strong glasses they could pick up
the rocky Sierra Madre range with its canyons
and valleys, where, unless all his leads have been
false clues, those whom they sought would have
their secret den and stronghold.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk got to thinking these matters over, and of
course he was bound to run across some things
that still seemed a bit hazy in his mind. Accordingly
he sought for information at headquarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, now, d’ye know I’m jest beginnin’ to get
on to why you had the wings an’ fuselage o’ this
here ship painted the color o’ sand—took a pattern
from the way they striped the steamers on
the Atlantic durin’ the big war, an’ colored batteries
on the battle front, so flyers couldn’t pick
’em out to drop their bombs down on—camouflage,
ain’t that the right word, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Slow to get on to my little schemes, partner;
but in the end you make a smart stab—yes, that
was what I had in mind, for I knew we’d have
to park the old bus somewhere in the open; and
I didn’t want any hostile eye to glimpse her from
a soaring plane, or a mountain crag—for you see
I reckoned Slim was too smart a lad not to have
binoculars handy so as to watch for trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>More than ever was Perk impressed with an
overwhelming admiration for the ability of his
pal to lay plans capable of covering every possible
necessity that could arise in carrying out
the job they had tackled.</p>

<p class='c013'>He asked no more questions, confident that
everything was bound to move along smoothly,
when the casting of the play was in such capable
hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Anyway,” he told himself as he thus pondered,
“we ain’t seen anything more o’ that moon
ship, which makes it certain we’ve knocked her
outen the runnin’. Wonder now if that was really
an’ truly ol’ Slim, totin’ a swell bunch o’ machine
guns, so’s to bolster up the new revolution
they say is bein’ fostered an’ nursed in this corner
o’ poor ol’ Mexico. Queer what international
jingles a feller c’n get mixed up in, when he runs
in harness with Uncle Sam’s revenue boys; but
it’s all pie to me, just the same, ’cause they allers
did say my middle name was Scrap.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was now starting to make use of the binoculars,
which were fitted with lens capable of
making them useful during the night-time, at
least when there was a certain amount of moonlight.
In a general way Perk could decide where
to turn his attention, for it went without saying
that the mountain chain lay toward the southeast
for had he not studied the lay of the land
upon the small but accurate map with which
Jack had armed himself before leaving Washington
to take up this hazardous adventure?</p>

<p class='c013'>When he felt assured that he could make out
the distant ridges he announced his pleasing discovery
to his mate and then at the other’s request
took over the controls so that Jack in turn might
use the glasses and thus make assurance doubly
safe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bank, and head more into the east,” Perk
heard the other saying, after a steady look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it’s the Sierra Madre okay, partner, I
opine?” suggested the one at the stick, as he
obeyed orders.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question about it,” Jack assured him “but
I knew it was time for us to sight the ridge. I’ve
pored over the map of this section, and charted
it all out in blocks, so I can tell just what the lay
of the land is, and how long it’s apt to take the
colonel to get here with his galloping company.
We’re going to drop down presently, and find
shelter where we can lie low until the hour comes
for making our ten strike.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How long might that be, boss?” asked Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It all depends on certain happenings. We
can creep up close to the place, and watch how
things move figuring out how to act when you
get your first glimpse of a dust cloud away off
toward where Hermosilla lies. I give the cavalry
two days to reach here, if everything moves along
smoothly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Two long days—an’ say, we gotter eat all that
time, don’t we, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We surely can’t live on air, Perk; but I’ve
provided for that—even should we run out of
grub you laid in I’ve a little deposit of dried
meat, real pemmican in fact, that will keep us
from famishing. Water we can secure somewhere
among the mountain trails, since never a
drop would we be apt to find on the open desert.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! I’m leavin’ it all to you, Big Boss,”
Perk told him, again lost in wonder and near
awe as he realized how Jack seemed to have
thought of everything—what a mind the boy had
for grasping details, and weaving them into the
net with which they expected to enmesh the slippery
one.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now Jack slowed down their speed more or
less, although of course it was not possible to
soften the clamor accompanying their flight
through space. But Perk noticed that, so far as
he could tell, the night wind was coming from
ahead, and this assured him it would not be apt
to carry those telltale sounds toward the range
lying in the east, and so warn the enemy of their
coming.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch28' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVIII <br /> <br />CLOSE TO THE TIGER’S LAIR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“We’re about due for a landing, Perk,” finally
announced the pilot, after he had used the glasses
for a spell, and again took over the stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! some hike that’s agoin’ to be, I’d say,
old hoss,” grunted Perk; “but I guess it can’t
be helped—got to take the bitter with the sweet
lots o’ times—the way o’ the world, seems like.
Go to it then, boss; if anybody c’n make a safe
landin’ by moonlight it’s jest you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>His confidence was not misplaced, as Jack
proved when he brought the ship down in as
perfect a three-point drop as the best of aces
could have carried out.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’ll have to lie here till we need her again,”
he observed, on climbing out of his confined
quarters, and stretching his cramped legs after
the manner of air mail pilots in from a long and
irksome run.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk stared around him—they were on the
sandy desert without a doubt, and off toward the
east could be seen the dim crests of the high and
ragged peaks comprising the main ridges of the
Sierra Madres—old-time home of the fierce
Yaqui Indians, whom the soldiers of Mexico had
for so many years labored so hard and in vain
to conquer; nor was it until the day the airplane
came along that they were able to accomplish
this much to be desired end.</p>

<p class='c013'>But now other equally annoying thorns in the
flesh had made a hideout of those same
inaccessible mountains—defeated aspirants for
the presidency of the Republic, always generals,
took to gathering groups of malcontents and mercenary
adventurers in these mountain depths,
defying the troops sent to rout them out, and
proving the latest source of trouble in the political
problems of the authorities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack soon completed his preparations for
abandoning their ship. He looked it all over, to
satisfy himself its camouflage would prevent it
from being sighted by any air pilot chancing to
pass overhead at a reasonable altitude then he
gathered a few articles, the possession of which
might turn out to be of value when it came to
closing the mouth of the bag and finally announced
himself as ready to make a move.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got all you wanted, Perk?” he inquired, incidentally,
for he had reason to feel certain such
was the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! from the binoculars an’ my rifle, down
to what’s left o’ the eats,” the other assured him.
“Guess we’ll get along somehow or other.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! don’t bother your head about the grub
part, comrade; I’m carrying a small packet with
me that holds enough to keep two men alive for
a whole week—all we’ll have to do is to run
across some sort of spring, where we can get all
the drinking water we’ll need, while we wait for
the wagon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! in this case you’re meanin’ a <i>hearse</i>,
’cause mebbe we’ll have to shoot him up afore he
calls quits,” and Perk grinned horribly at his
own wit.</p>

<p class='c013'>So they left the ship stranded there, sprawled
out like a gigantic dragon-fly or a monstrous
toad. If Fortune proved kind they might yet
live to make good use of it again when the time
came to fly back to God’s country on the other
side of the border where defeated candidates
are in the habit of accepting the dictum of the
voters, and retiring from the field of battle await
the next call to arms, with ballots instead of
bullets as their method of settling elections.</p>

<p class='c013'>Side by side they set forth, like a pair of adventurers
starting out in search of Fortune’s
smiles, and careless alike as to whether they met
with success or not, so long as the excitement
they craved came their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk managed to conceal the chagrin with
which he buckled down to his unwelcome task,
walking always gave him a pain, mental rather
than physical but on the whole he was a good
scout, and could follow the beckoning finger of
duty, even though he loathed the conditions attached
to the performance of his role.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sand was far from compact, and allowed
them to sink in somewhat, so this made the going
more difficult in contrast to that on the seashore
which being beaten down by incoming waves is
often as hard as concrete and a pleasure to walk
over; whereas this of the desert was dry and
sifted at the least puff of wind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk having had some previous experience
with deserts, felt no love for the uninviting waste
places of the earth only such useless vegetation
as sage, greasewood, cactus and yucca would
grow between the sand dunes amidst the blistering
fangs of the infernal heat and always vowed
he disliked such arid regions with a violence too
deep for mere words.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet he kept his own counsel and plodded away
alongside his pal as if he had no personal feelings
in the matter whatsoever. Far off in front
of them they could see the line of peaks studded
against the sky once or twice Perk felt certain
he had caught a fluttering light aloft such as
might spring from a passing plane but in every
instance he finally decided it must be some shooting
star, ducking behind the mountain range,
leaving a trailing wake behind that but reflected
its passing glory.</p>

<p class='c013'>One hour, two, and then a third dragged along
before Jack thought fit to call a halt. Never did
poor weary footsore Perk, almost used up, listen
to more welcome and delightful words than
when Jack as he drew to a halt went on to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Time to rest, partner, you know—I’d like to
find a bunch of shady trees that would afford us
a decent shelter from the blazing sun, should we
be so unfortunate as to get adrift after leaving
all landmarks behind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! bless you for sayin’ that, buddy,” Perk
was saying hoarsely, for his throat seemed as dry
as tinder, the fine sand even affecting his vocal
cords so that he would not have recognized his
own voice. “By your leave I guess I’ll lie down
and get the kinks outen my legs. Wow! that
must abeen fi’ miles if she was one—my shoes
are full o’ sand, an’ altogether I don’t feel half
the man I was on startin’ out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There are some trees over yonder, you may
notice, Perk; so after we’ve caught our second
wind we’ll take chances, and cut across to where
they lie, perhaps when morning comes tripping
along, we may climb up the face of the mountain
and get a look-in at the printing establishment
that’s set itself up in opposition to the U. S.
Treasury Department, and the Federal Bank.
Come on then, a little further where we can drop
down, and rest our weary feet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards the pair had crept in
among the sheltering trees, where Jack called a
rest, although under the impression that they
should get along further before break of day.</p>

<p class='c013'>He talked matters over with his partner, speaking
almost in whispers, since in this enemy country
no one could take anything for granted and
for all they knew hostile ears might chance to
be close by, ready to listen in.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Perk himself who proposed to move
along while the going was good.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like we might be a heap better off, old
hoss, if on’y we located up thar on the side o’ the
mountain, where we could see without our bein’
watched. I’m okay now, an’ ready for b’ar.”</p>

<p class='c013'>That was the spirit Jack liked in his mate—a
readiness to take hold and reach a decision. They
moved along toward the base of the forbidding
height, keeping a watchful eye on the eastern
sky lest dawn come and surprise them in the
open, where it would not be easy to find a hiding
place during the entire day.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fortune favored them, for they managed to
get under cover before the first gray streaks appeared
in the east. It was bound to be a strenuous
task climbing that formidable mountain side
but Jack had prepared for even this part of the
adventure.</p>

<p class='c013'>From various sources he had learned how there
were three separate means for subduing that
grim pyramid of rocks and trees and tangled
growth—in order to lessen the chances of discovery,
with unpleasant consequences, Jack had
decided to try and negotiate the most difficult
of these mountain trails in the belief that it
would offer a safer passage since evidently none
of the seething revolutionists, or their allies, the
bad men from across the border, would be likely
to follow that canyon trail when others less difficult
could be utilized.</p>

<p class='c013'>Down there hidden by the bushes and spurs
of outlying rock they employed their time in
munching what must serve as their breakfast.
Then quenching their thirst at a convenient
pool they proceeded to climb the face of
the steep elevation, making for the quaint hollow
in the crater of a long dead volcano and which
had once been a Yaqui fort.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch29' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIX <br /> <br />NEARING THE GOAL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>They had now reached that most thrilling
point in their bold venture, where they would
have to “watch their steps” most carefully, lest
an incautious act precipitate a calamity that must
end all their hopes as well as snuff out their
lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>This breeding place for inflammatory embers
of Mexican revolutionary disappointed political
generals, and their immediate retainers, was
about as safe for the two sky detectives as a cage
of Bengal tigers would have been once let their
presence be suspected, and the entire neighborhood
would be scratched over as with a fine-tooth
comb in the endeavor to discover their
hiding place and should they be rounded up it
needed no magician to prophesy what their fate
must be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack led the way, with Perk following at his
heels, every sense on the alert. The native cougar
of that historical group of mountains could
hardly have crept along with greater care than
did the two human sleuth hounds of the law.
Every advance was attempted only after a careful
survey of the entire neighborhood—at the
sound of some faint bird-call Jack would sink
down and flatten himself upon the ground, his
example being imitated by his shadow.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this caused their progress to be exceedingly
slow but time did not enter into their calculations
so much as security—many hours must
pass ere Jack could figure on the arrival of those
upon whom everything depended and they
might as well make use of the entire morning in
climbing higher and higher toward their ultimate
goal.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once when they chanced to be resting their
tired limbs, snug in a sheltered nook behind a
mass of brushwood, Jack turned and looked back.
The site was especially fine for looking out on
the level stretch toward the spot where they had
landed during the preceding night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, watching the actions of his comrade,
could easily give a close guess as to what Jack
had in mind. This opinion was made more convincing
when he saw the other get out the useful
binoculars, and apply them to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Keenly he kept tabs on the others and was
finally thrilled to note the pleased nod Jack gave
as if wholly satisfied.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk touched him on the arm, and as Jack
turned made motions with his head, while his
eyebrows went up, his expression without a single
word being spoken signifying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How come?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take a look for yourself, and tell me if you
can get the first glimpse of our old crate” suggested
Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ doin,” whispered Perk, after a most
diligent search; “an’ if we can’t get a whiff o’
the boat, with these glasses, I kinder guess
nobody ain’t agoin’ to locate it with their naked
eyes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which same lets us out from any danger in
that quarter,” came softly from Jack, whose face
for the moment lost some of the strained look it
had borne during the last few hours.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never saw a better sample o’ camouflage
when I was across the big pond alistenin’ to the
smash o’ the rip-roarin’ German guns,” asserted
Perk; and then “dried up” when he saw the
other press a finger on his lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>Higher they climbed, like monkeys, taking all
manner of desperate chances when necessity
arose but so cautious was Jack in leading the
way that nothing amiss came about, every obstacle
being successfully surmounted until
shortly before the noon hour they found themselves
in a position to spy upon the camp of their
intended prey.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was intensely interested in what he now
visioned. The old crater, resembling an immense
football bowl, as adopted by some Eastern
colleges, looked as though it might have proven
well nigh impregnable as a fortress where the
fighting Yaquis were able to hold an army at
bay—which feat history records as an actual fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>Scattered about the depression were scores of
rude dwellings, some built of rocks, while others
more modern had walls composed of sun-baked
bricks, known throughout all Mexico as <i>adobes</i>.
Men and women, also children, could be seen
moving about, preparing the noonday meal or
partaking of their customary frijoles, hot tamales,
or it might be maize cakes cooked in the
hot ashes of fires, and with black coffee as a
beverage.</p>

<p class='c013'>The picture appealed to Perk, who delighted
in novel scenes nor did it seem to lose any of
its thrill from the fact that, as he very well knew,
the men he was staring at so eagerly were most
likely as tough a brand of desperadoes and villains
as could be grouped together anywhere on
earth—ready to fight, hold up trains, or commit
all manner of pillage at the drop of a hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>He marveled at the sagacity shown by Slippery
Slim in deciding to join forces with these
firebrands of the back country, with the idea of
thus securing the greatest safety for his own
lawless operations.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this while Jack had been keeping close
watch, in hopes of being able to pick out the
figure of the man he had been deputized to bring
back to the States so he might be prosecuted for
his crimes, and sent to Atlanta. There he would
possibly end his days in seclusion, with a large
portion of the Southwest breathing more freely
since they need no longer fear the avalanche of
counterfeit currency that had been demoralizing
business for such a long spell.</p>

<p class='c013'>After all it was Perk who made the discovery,
he chancing to be carefully handling the binoculars
at the time. He handed the glasses over to
his mate, and told Jack just where to look, using
as few words as possible, and keeping his voice
very low.</p>

<p class='c013'>Long and earnestly did Jack follow the movements
of the remarkable character who had been
described in his hearing so many times. What
satisfaction it afforded him to know he was actually
in sight of the big game and if only his
plans carried through his hour of triumph was
steadily drawing closer and closer. In imagination,
as he continued to watch the moving figure,
he could vision the pleasure it would afford him
when he could turn in his report to his Chief,
and mark it as completed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon drifted along, and night approached.
Nothing could be done to hasten the
crisis; they must wait patiently, and continue to
shape their plans until the expected smoke signal
told them Morales and his rough riders had
reached the foot of the Sierra Madres ten miles
further south and when assured by means of a
counter signal that everything was working well,
start to cover the last lap of their long ride, leave
their mounts at a safe distance, and complete the
journey on foot.</p>

<p class='c013'>When darkness fell the picture was even more
fascinating to Perk than before, with a number
of fires lighting up the huge bowl, the sound of
women chattering in Spanish, and children playing
just as all youngsters might do while from
time to time he could catch strains of music, telling
that some amorous swain might be practicing
on his guitar, as all who have a drop of Spanish
blood in their veins invariably love to do when
at leisure.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk doubtless made many a grimace while
partaking of the light refreshment afforded by
the tough pemmican Jack had produced, as their
sole means for staying their empty stomachs for
when the evening breeze wafted some of the
odors from the cooking fires down below it almost
set him wild with a desire to partake of hot
food. But he knew what he was up against, and
sternly repressed the inclination to groan his
protest.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was one of the longest nights Perk ever
knew. The mountain air, too, was cold, especially
along toward the last few hours and since
they were debarred from the joy of indulging
in a campfire, Perk could only lie there and
shiver. He never was so glad to see the pink
sky in the east as on that occasion.</p>

<p class='c013'>The day was but a repetition of their former
afternoon with their sole recreation being the
chance it gave them to watch Slippery Slim’s
movements whenever he appeared coming out of
what seemed to be a cavern of some sort from
which at several times when the racket from many
tongues died down Perk could catch a strange
rumbling sound, accompanied by what seemed
to be a blow, and which he could easily believe
must be the working of the printing press that
had been carried all the way from the States in
order to be able to produce those wonderfully
clever notes that had deceived many shrewd
bank tellers by their deceptive qualities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then at last Jack discovered, just as night had
begun to fall, three columns of smoke rising toward
the heavens from far down the wild Sierra,
telling how that Morales and his troop had arrived,
and that the curtain was about to rise on
the last scene of the international drama.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch30' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXX <br /> <br />JACK GETS HIS MAN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Immediately on discovering the welcome signal,
Jack dispatched Perk to put a match to the
heap of brush they had arranged well out of sight
from the depression where the skeleton revolutionary
army was slowly assembling its pitiful
force of the dissatisfied generals who had been
counted out in the last national election.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk understood what was expected of him,
and managed to send up a single smoke signal,
allowing it to have but a brief life and then hastening
to smother the fire. As Morales was expected
to be on the watch for just such a sign,
he would lose little time in starting to carry out
his part in the attack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In three hours they will be climbing the
mountain by way of the old Yaqui trail we followed,”
Jack was telling his chum, when the
other returned to his side, flushed with the success
of his labors. “It is time for us to make a
forward move, so that we may be ready to strike
as soon as the camp quiets down and corral our
man, leaving it to Morales to carry the fort itself
by storm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This they set about doing without any further
delay. Dodging from rock to rock, taking advantage
of every outlying spur, as well as patches
of hardy bushes, and other objects that were
likely to conceal their movements from any
watchful eyes but always creeping downward,
they crawled along like two great lizards such,
as Perk could remember seeing when in the
Philippines.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the time they were ready to slip into the
underground pressroom of the lawless printing
company’s plant, Jack figured the three hours
had just about expired, and that it was now up to
them to make the first hostile move that would
precipitate the assault.</p>

<p class='c013'>In thus deciding to make a start he was influenced
by seeing an agreed upon signal from
the same hiding place he and Perk had held for
so many hours, and which told him the troopers
had finally succeeded in climbing to the position
assigned to them when plans for action were
formed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Flattening themselves out against the dark
wall of a small cliff Jack and Perk glided along
until they arrived at that aperture in the solid
rock they knew to be the entrance to the wonderful
underground retreat that had been described
by Simeon at the time when in his desperation
he gave his confederates away and from which
they had watched Slippery Slim come and go
during those long hours of their espionage.</p>

<p class='c013'>Slipping inside, they found themselves in a
corridor that led into the body of the mountain
with a gleam of light beckoning them to advance.
In this fashion they kept moving, gliding from
one point to another, until eventually they had a
clear view of the little machine that was working
so industriously in turning out the bogus
money, hour after hour, as though the demand
were without limit.</p>

<p class='c013'>How Perk did stare, and hold his breath when
realizing that they were upon the verge of accomplishing
their great undertaking. Slippery
Slim was doing no actual manual labor himself,
but he kept close watch over the two men who
ran the press, closely scrutinizing the printed
bills as if to detect the slightest inaccuracy, and
correct it without delay.</p>

<p class='c013'>No wonder, Jack told himself, the product of
his skill had startled the financial world by its
genuine appearance, when such a master in his
particular line took such personal pains to see
that the work was carried out in its most minute
details.</p>

<p class='c013'>In whispers Jack informed his backer what his
duty would be when the roar of guns and hoarse
shouts from without announced that the picked
troopers had actually launched their long deferred
assault. Jack had taken it upon himself
to close in on the chief worker in that little
coterie, and have the glory of capturing Slippery
Slim unaided but meanwhile Perk might find
plenty of action in holding up those two others
who were second in importance only to the leading
figure.</p>

<p class='c013'>The tension had become almost unendurable
when suddenly there broke out a frightful uproar—women
were shrieking, children’s high
pitched voices told of intense alarm; men gave
tongue, and above it all guns began to sound with
deadly import, until the basin rocked with the
dreadful clamor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack waited no longer, but giving Perk a kick
on the shins to tell him to get busy he rushed
headlong toward Slippery Slim, holding his automatic
ready for instant service, knowing as he
did that such a desperate bad man as Slim
was reckoned from all accounts, would not be
apt to surrender so long as there remained the
slightest chance for a getaway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nor was he mistaken in judging the character
of the man who had so long defied the shrewdest
detectives of the United States Secret Service
for when Slim found his way to the open air
barred by such a determined looking figure, he
snatched out his handy gat and made as if to open
fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>For once he was just a trifle too slow with his
service gun, for Jack, clever lad that he was
along the line of firing off-hand, managed to send
a bullet through Slim’s right shoulder that crippled
him, so that his own weapon went rattling
to the stone under his feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put ’em up!” Jack was saying, covering his
man as he spoke and having no desire to commit
suicide, Slippery Slim obeyed the call; and
instantly afterwards suffering the painful ignominy
of having his wrists encircled by a pair
of nice new steel bracelets.</p>

<p class='c013'>So far so good, with Jack, his own share of the
capture an accomplished fact, able to turn in
order to lend Perk a helping hand. It was not
needed, for Perk had descended on those two
muscular chaps like a thunderbolt, knocking one
down with a terrific jolt under the chin and
causing the other to look along the short barrel
of his blued automatic, he having discarded the
repeating rifle for the time being in favor of
the easier handled pocket gun.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the trio of discomfited rogues were all
handcuffed, Jack and his reliable partner turned
and faced the other way, so as to be ready for a
rush, should some of those valorous generals
decide to take advantage of the defensive security
of the rock cave, and bolt into its gaping mouth.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being actually attempted they met with
a demoralizing surprise when they found themselves
the objects of a hot fire, that brought about
a complete right-about face movement and
presently forced their ignominious surrender to
the gallant Colonel Morales and his fierce fighters,
who had once before gone through an interesting
campaign in that same old extinct volcano
vent, with warlike redskins as their opponents.</p>

<p class='c013'>The end was not long in coming, with many
of the would-be revolutionists holding up their
hands in complete surrender others escaping
by losing themselves along the scraggly sides of
the mountains and not a few either slain outright,
or seriously wounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and his chum had a chance to meet the
doughty Colonel Morales, pride of the Mexican
army, and be congratulated on their clever work
of rounding up such a jack-o’-lantern, fly-by-night
as Slim Garrabrant. Of course the two
comrades were eager to start back to the other
side of the border, since complications might
come up over their legal warrant to arrest a criminal
so badly wanted by the Washington authorities,
but who had made his headquarters south
of the international line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly they handed over Slim’s two lieutenants,
who would have to answer to a charge
of being hand-in-glove with those plotting generals,
and doubtless find themselves incarcerated
in a Mexican dungeon for some years, a fate that
made Perk shudder to contemplate.</p>

<p class='c013'>While he stood guard over their prisoner, Jack
sent Perk off at dawn, mounted on one of the
cavalry horses, and accompanied by a soldier
who would fetch back both animals, Perk’s duty
being to get the stranded ship off the ground,
and drop down at a more convenient spot closer
to the former mountain stronghold of the tiger-like
Yaquis.</p>

<p class='c013'>By nightfall they were hundreds of miles on
their way over Arizona and New Mexico, Jack
having decided to carry his prisoner, whose
wound did not prove to be very serious, though
painful enough—all the way to Washington, and
present him to his superior, with his customary
air of not realizing that he had done anything
extraordinary.</p>

<p class='c013'>That this thrilling feat was only a common
occurrence in the lives of such intrepid manhunters
as serve the Government through the
agency of the Secret Service and that from time
to time Jack and Perk might with reason be
expected to duplicate such adventurous feats can
be set down as certain; indeed, the title of the
next number in the Sky Detective Series, “<i>Eagles
of the Sky; or With Jack Ralston Along the Air
Lanes</i>,” a tale of the smugglers of the Florida
Coast, will grip the reader from start to finish,
and prove to be one of the most thrilling stories
ever written for lovers of action and valor.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent

For additional contact information:
     Dr. Gregory B. Newby
     Chief Executive and Director
     gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

</div>

<div>
  <h2 id='ch01' class='c011'>CHAPTER I <br /> <br />READY FOR THE TAKE-OFF</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>It was a day in the late Fall when Jack
Ralston, accompanied by his best pal, Gabe
Perkiser, known simply as “Perk” by all his
friends, found themselves climbing out of a
hired taxi that had halted on the border of
Candler Flying Field just a short distance out
of Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! reg’lar mob out here today, seems
like,” observed Perk, as he took note of the
triple line of cars parked around the field, with
its numerous up-to-date hangars, and with ships
coming and going every few minutes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, you see Perk, it happens to be a big day
at stunt flying, with fat prizes for the winners.
All the better for us, I’d say, since our take-off
will hardly make a ripple in the pond, with all
this confusion going on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing, my boy,” continued Perk, with
one of his humorous grins that betokened a good-natured
chap; “and privacy’s just what we crave.
I guess now that might be the mail comin’ from
down East an’ New York?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A rotten guess then, Perk,” chortled the
other; “Eastern mail boat was due here at six-ten
this morning; the Pitcairn Aviation concern
handle that route, as well as the run between
Atlanta and Miami down in Florida; and I’m
telling you for a fact the boys holding the stick
with <i>that</i> corporation are nearly always on time
to the dot, come storm, come fog as thick as
pea-soup. The schedule I glimpsed at the Atlanta
post office gave the time of the East Coast
ship as seven-thirty P. M.; that from New Orleans
at six-thirty P. M.; and the one from
Chicago about the same time. So you see it
couldn’t be a mail crate dropping down right
now, unless they’d had to make a forced landing,
and lost time in making repairs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, come to think of it I sure did hear a
bus passin’ over just at peep o’ day,” admitted
Perk. “Let’s have a look-in while we’re here,
and see what a bag o’ tricks these stunt flyers
are holdin’ up their sleeves, so’s to give this
crowd a row o’ thrills.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suits me, Perk; no great hurry about our
jumping off, so long as we pull the gun before
dark sets in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! little difference it makes on a patch
as well lighted as this Candler Field o’ your
home city, old boy; and with a flashlight beacon
set every ten miles all the way down to Orleans,
to keep us on our course. Look at that guy
fairly burning the air like hot cakes—he must
be tryin’ to beat the speed record, I guess, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hardly a day comes without some record
going by the board,” remarked Jack, who had
a reputation as a safe and sane pilot, although
on occasion he had been known to put through
some tricks so death-defying as to make the
hearts of the spectators seem to jump up in
their throats with the thrill.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was quite correct when he stated that
Atlanta was the home city of his close friend
and chum; although Jack’s family had moved
away years back, and become fruit raisers in
far-off California. Still, having spent some
years in the Georgia capital Jack always liked
to drop in and renew a limited number of old
friendships when opportunity offered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack Ralston had begun his aviation work
starting at the lowest round, that of a Gypsy
pilot, flying an ancient boat at County Fairs and
Harvest Home gatherings; doing aerial stunts,
and “bailing out” by means of a parachute while
another pilot ran the ship; also taking up air
minded “sand-bags” as passengers at so much
each person.</p>

<p class='c013'>From this modest beginning he had finally
accepted a position with an aircraft corporation
having contracts with the Post Office Department
at Washington for carrying the mails, and
later on express matter as well; and last of all
working for Uncle Sam through joining the
Secret Service corps of skillful detectives, whose
activities covered every part of the Nation, and
even to adjacent countries as well.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the Government wearied of the bold
doings of one “Slippery Slim” Garrabrant, and
decided to “clip the wings” of that audacious
freebooter and bogus-money crook, it was only
natural they should pick Jack for this service.
The reasons for doing so were many, but what
counted most was Jack’s well known cleverness
as an all-round air pilot; for it happened that
the slick rogue who had been giving the revenue
men such a wild-goose chase, with his thumb
held up to his nose, so to speak, was himself a
remarkable master of the air lanes, he having
been an ace as a flying pilot over with the army
on the Argonne front in France.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since as a rule this troublesome offender carried
on his bold enterprises by means of a handy
plane—frequently with a single assistant, who
helped handle both ship and cargo—the man
thus selected to put a crimp in his activities was
likewise given full permission to engage a helper
from the same arm of the Government forces,
one who must of course know something about
the handling of a plane, so that in case of necessity
he could serve as co-pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack lost no time in picking Gabe Perkiser,
otherwise known simply as “Perk”—a man who
had supped with adventure since he was “knee
high to a duck”—a half Yankee—half Canuck,
drifting into the army, and serving with the
sausage observation balloon corps over in
France; from which patriotic occupation he
later on became a champion light-weight boxer.
Leaving the ring while as yet undefeated he
served for several years with the Canadian
Mounted Police. Here his smartness in usually
fetching back his man, no matter what the difficulties
that had to be surmounted, attracted
the attention of a gentleman connected with
Uncle Sam’s Secret Service, just then moose
hunting over the northern border, who finally
influenced Perk to join up with his force.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and the other had met under peculiar
conditions when both were tracking a bunch of
check raisers floating across the country and
leaving a wide swath of victims in their path.
They had become more than friends, although
meeting but seldom; then, when the opportunity
came for Jack to call upon Perk to join him in
the new job that had been turned over to his
charge, the latter had responded with alacrity.</p>

<p class='c013'>So here they were, on the threshold of an
affair that promised to engage their united talents
in running down the leader of the most
troublesome gang of counterfeit currency makers
known to the Government agents in the last
ten years.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every clue possessed at Headquarters had
been turned over to Jack at the time he was
given authority to carry on as the situation demanded;
although this information was a bit
limited, and much was left to the shrewdness
of the two trail hounds themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no hurry at all, and Jack had
always been one of those cautious workers who
meant to provide for all sorts of emergencies.
Only too well did he know how many a splendid
undertaking went on the rocks from lack of
foreseeing the next move on the part of the
astute criminals whose apprehension meant so
much to the Government, as well as the folks
they were victimizing.</p>

<p class='c013'>But by now he had decided everything was
arranged so far as human means would permit,
and that it was high time they started on their
long chase. Their boat, a Stinson Detroiter, a
monoplane with a Wright Whirlwind motor,
and reckoned to be an unusually swift craft, was
already loaded, and ready for immediate departure.
It had been stored in one of the big
hangars connected with the Candler Flying
Field but could be taxied into position when
Jack felt ready to skip off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their flying togs were also contained in a
locker in the same hangar, and could be donned
in a jiffy, even to the ’chute harness that was
so familiar to Jack, and a constant reminder of
early experiences when he was accustomed to
carry out his daily program of “quitting the
ship” with as much <i>sang froid</i> as though the
jump into space from a five thousand foot ceiling
were absolutely next to nothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>But plainly Perk was becoming a bit restless,
as though eager to be on his way; which fact
doubtless influenced Jack to eventually give the
word that took them to their hangar. Here
they commenced preparing for a night flight
that was expected to land them in New Orleans,
where Jack was to interview a certain representative
of the Government service, from whom
he anticipated receiving a few valuable tips that
would give them something tangible and serve
as a beginning of their arduous chase.</p>

<p class='c013'>While they were thus engaged someone
hailed them with a boisterous greeting, at which
Perk grinned, and made a suitable reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hey, Scotty, this your night off, is it—got
in from your route okay, and stepped out to see
the boys cut a few figger-eights in the sky—just
can’t keep away from the game, even when you
got a lay-off? What’s new, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They told me at the house you expected to
step off tonight, boys—is that a fact, or did they
slip an easy one over me, I want to know?” demanded
the other, who was apparently a mail
pilot friend of theirs—in fact, having the adjoining
room at the small hotel where they were
stopping.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” Jack told him, secretive as usual,
“we’re going further, and boosting the Stinson
Detroiter ship by showing what it has to set it
above most other boats. Plans not fully arranged
as yet, but we’re on our way; so it’s good-bye,
and good luck to you, Scotty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about that news, Scotty?” the insistent
Perk went on to demand, being by nature one of
those stubborn chaps who can never be happy
until they get what they are after, no matter
how trivial it may seem.</p>

<p class='c013'>The air mail pilot scratched his head, and
then with a grin answered Perk’s question.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much along the line of aviation;
but something queer happened to me—say, did
you boys sleep at home last night while I was
on the road?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We sure did,” Perk told him, and then
added: “What makes you ask that, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Didn’t hear any sort of racket in my den
did you, fellows?” continued the other; at which
Perk, after exchanging a look of bewilderment
with his pal, hastened to answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a thing, Scotty; but then you know I
sleep like a log; and it’d have to be a thunderclap
to wake me up; what’s been going on?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You got me guessing, Perk,” said the other,
with a look of disgust; “only when I got in this
morning I found my room looking like a hurricane
had struck it, my things tossed out of drawers,
my trunk broken open, and say, you never
saw such a dirty mess. Course I asked the boss
what it meant; but he was as much surprised
as I was—talked with every servant from the
cook down to Mary the chamber maid; but
nobody could tell a darned thing about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again Jack and Perk exchanged a swift
glance, as though the same idea had struck both
of them. Scotty did not appear to notice this,
being too worked up with the mystery that had
so suddenly gripped his fortunes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did you lose anything worth while, Scotty?”
Jack asked, in a voice that suggested sympathy;
but to his surprise the other shook his head in
the negative, and even grinned as he lifted his
heavy eyebrows to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s the funny part of it, boys; whoever
the sneak thief was, he didn’t even dent me a
little bit—so far as I c’n see not a blessed thing
is missing—fact is, I’m even better off than before
he paid that queer visit, ’cause he left this
old pocketbook mixed up with my traps; and
it ain’t mine for a fact, though I’m meaning to
spend the little wad of dough it holds. Like
manna coming down to the children of Israel
in the Wilderness, wouldn’t you say, boys?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lucky old hoss you are, Scotty,” remarked
Perk, enviously; while Jack nodded his head as
though to echo the sentiment.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c014'>CHAPTER II <br /> <br />THE LUCK OF SCOTTY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Happen to have that pocketbook along with
you, Scotty?” asked Jack, in a matter of fact
tone; just as though he might be possessed of
ordinary curiosity concerning so amazing a
visit; since never before had he heard of a night
prowler leaving his own money behind him,
when his intention had been to rob his victim.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing, Jack,” promptly replied the air
mail pilot; “here, take a squint at my Christmas
present, dropped in by old Santa Claus
a bit before the reg’lar holiday season,” and with
a laugh he chucked the object in question into
the hand of the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Old, just as you remarked, Scotty,” observed
Jack, “and used a long time. It must have
slipped out of his pocket when he worked your
stuff over to mix it up like the devil.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Open it up and see what the blessed chump
left me in place of his card,” the other continued,
looking exceedingly proud over his lucky
find.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did that with alacrity; in fact it
was what he intended doing, for reasons of his
own; something more than curiosity influencing
him, it would appear.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gee whiz! a neat little bunch of the needful,
I’d say, Scotty, old hoss!” burst out the envious
Perk, his eyes fixed full upon the contents of
the much worn pocketbook, which Jack was
holding in his hand and apparently interested
in counting, for there were a number of bank
notes for various amounts, and among them just
three five-dollar bills, seemingly quite fresh,
though a bit soiled, as though they had been in
circulation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nineteen smackers in all,” announced Perk,
showing that he had also been keeping tabs on
the count. “Well, wouldn’t that knock you cold
though? Huh? that same caller must’ve been
looking for <i>me</i>, and just missed connections by
striking the next door. Well, here’s wishing you
the same old luck every time a sneak thief pays
you a visit, Scotty boy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack on his part was feeling of the three five-dollar
bills, and holding them up to the light
from the western sun that managed to come
into the hangar by way of the open doors.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What ails you, Jack?” demanded the recipient
of Fortune’s smiles, as he noticed these
strange actions on the part of his new friend.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much,” he was told, “only I’m going
to give you a bit of advice, partner, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to it, boy; always willing to take it
when it seems sound!” snapped the mail carrier,
briskly enough, still more than curious.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you’re wise, Scotty,” went on Jack, smilingly,
“you’ll not try to pass any one of these
five-dollar bills until you’ve asked the opinion
of some bank teller—it might get you into
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Zowie! what’s that you’re saying, Jack—don’t
tell me they’re off-color bills, counterfeits
in fact. Wouldn’t that be a rotten deal to hand
out, and me figgering how I’d spend them? Is
<i>that</i> what you mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon it’s so, Scotty, much as I hate to
knock your good luck,” Jack told him, with a
shake of his head. “I happened to have a little
experience in a small bank some years ago and
they did say I showed signs of being a clever
detector of bad money. That’s a clever job all
right; but I’m afraid it won’t stand the wash
worth a cent. Go slow, and don’t count your
chickens before they’re hatched. Also I’d advise
you not to go around telling about your windfall
until you’ve shown this stuff to some friendly
bank official, whose advice you’d be willing to
take. If he says it’s good stuff why forget what
I’m saying, and go the limit. But we’d better
be finishing our own job, Perk, and get off on
our jump.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Scotty hung around for a short time, looking
puzzled, as though he hardly knew how much
to believe. What Jack had said in his friendly
fashion had doubtless cast quite a damper on
certain bright dreams in which he had been indulging.
However, he finally decided to take
himself off, evidently eager to know whether
the laugh was on him or not, for he called out:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goodbye, Jack, Perk; and be sure to look me
up when next you drop in at Candler Field Airport;
like as not I’ll still be on my old job here,
unless they decide to transfer me somewhere else.
And say, Jack, I’m meaning to take your advice,
and get an opinion on this here stuff ’fore I try
to pass it out on any old duffer. So-long boys
and luck!”</p>

<p class='c013'>When the two comrades, adventure bound,
found themselves alone they looked at each other
in silence for almost a full minute, when a grin
started to travel over Perk’s well bronzed face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, wouldn’t it jar you though, to have such
luck knock at your door, and then give you a sly
kick?” he demanded of his companion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To tell the honest truth, Perk, I’m not thinking
about Scotty and his queer windfall; it’s
our own great good luck that’s making me suspect
we’re bound to carry this job through with
flying colors.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Eh? now what d’ye mean by saying that?”
asked the other hastily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right in the beginning, Perk, we seem to
have stumbled on a nice little plum in the shape
of a clue—flung directly at our heads, you might
say in the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! do you mean to tell me those bogus
notes were off the same plates we’ve been
hearing so much about lately that I’ve been
dreamin’ I was tied hand an’ foot, an’ poked
under a dozen bales of them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just that, as sure as you live, partner,” said
Jack, composedly; but if he could take it so
coolly, not so his right bower who showed signs
of extreme excitement and satisfaction, for he
thrust out his hand, that had so often been an
object of vast respect on the part of some welter
weight boxer, and insisted that Jack accept a
gentle shake.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re sure Fortune’s favorites,” Perk was
saying, striking an attitude as he thus proudly
spoke; “an’ with such luck hoverin’ over our
heads I vow all the Lower Regions with its devils
can’t prevail against us. But see here, old hoss,
there’s more than chance in this break o’ the
party who broke through Scotty’s door, and
panned all his traps—I guess now he must have
missed a cylinder, an’ jest passed us by in a
ground loop.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was accustomed to the other’s quaint way
of expressing himself, for he lost no time in
adding:</p>

<p class='c013'>“About that way, I take it, Perk. And if
what we suspect turns out to be true, it stands to
reason there’s some sort of big combine back of
it all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“With this same Slippery Slim Garrabrant
pulling the wires for the whole bunch, is that
what you mean, Jack?” demanded the other flyer
quickly; for when once set on the right track
Perk’s mind could travel speedily enough.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s certainly his brain that’s built up this
wide flim-flam trade in the make believe green
stuff that’s been fooling a whole lot of bank tellers,
it’s so near the genuine article. To
smash the combine we’ve got to check up on
Slim; after he’s caged the entire arrangement’s
bound to fall through.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, partner; and them’s my sentiments
every time,” admitted the eager Perk. “And
here, when we’re starting out to pull off our
fresh stunt, I’m wishing all the luck that’s going
to our little game. Meaning to give her a last
checking over, eh, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s a habit of mine, as you know, Perk; and
you might amuse yourself stowing the cargo
we’ve taken aboard, so’s to let us have room for
our feet when we take off. From the looks of
the junk you picked up anybody’d reckon we
planned to go into camp for a week or two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, mebbe that’s what’ll happen to us before
we strike pay dirt in this ticklish job,”
asserted Perk, stoutly. “You know we figgered
things out, and made up our minds this same
slick article of a Slim might have his hangout
over the line in Old Mexico, where he prints
his bad bills, and then comes across the line with
a big bunch in his ship, so’s to scatter the stuff
around to his agents in Texas and Arizona, or
it might be all through Southern California. If
that guess turns out to be a bullseye we might
be away off the line of travel for days at a stretch,
and a grub stake’d turn the trick okay, I’m thinking,
boss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack made no reply, for he was already busily
engaged in looking over his crate. This was, as
he had mentioned, an old habit, contracted in
the early days of his career as an aviator of sorts;
and most likely such extreme caution had saved
his life more than once.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he too worked close by, Perk was thinking
more or less about something that had caught
his ever watchful eye just before they entered
the hangar to make these last preparations for
their southern flight. As usual he was unable
to keep his speculations entirely to himself, since
he always liked to compare notes, and find out
whether his companion’s views coincided with
his own.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, Jack, did you happen to notice that
Ryan ship they’d just taken out of the shed before
ours?” he demanded, while still lifting
packages of various supplies, and stowing them
away in a shipshape fashion; so they would not
be likely to shift, and thus imperil the safety
of himself and comrade, should they chance to
encounter rough weather later on.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not particularly,” came the answer. “I was
too busy over my own affairs to bother with anything
that didn’t concern me in the least. What
of it, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much, old hoss, only it was a next
to new bus, and hadn’t been flown more’n a few
thousand air miles, I’d guess. Couple of fellers
seemed to be the crew, one of ’em lookin’ like
he might be a pilot; and the other a chap that
was out to have a jolly good time sportin’ for
sport. I saw him handlin’ some sort of gun,
which made me guess he was down South for
the shootin’ season—mebbe after bear in the
Louisiana canebrakes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack laughed as if amused, for he had noted
the way in which the other made this stab at
what might be the designs of the unknown
parties.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Feel a bit envious I take it, Perk,” he observed,
laconically. “Always did yearn for the
day to come when you’d have a ship of your
own, and could spend all your spare time jumping
about the country, enjoying yourself with
rod and gun. Cheer up, old sport, you may live
to see that day yet, if things break right for us
in a few big games like this one we’re running
down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thanks for your good luck wishes, Jack,” the
other was saying; “I c’n just picture the bully
times that pair’ll like enough have sitting by
their camp-fire, living on game they’ve knocked
over, and not caring a darn whether school
keeps or not. Oh! well, if I live long enough
mebbe I may have a whiff of that kind of life
before I kick off for keeps; they say everything
comes to the man who waits, and that’s me.
There, that finishes my job, with everything
stowed away as slick as you please. When you’re
ready, Jack, we’ll be on our way.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c014'>CHAPTER III <br /> <br />HEADED SOUTH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Apparently Jack had completed his task
about the same time, for he was adjusting his
’chute harness, without which he seldom made a
long distance flight. This was only second nature
to him, because of the long experience he
had had in barnstorming, and doing stunts for
a living in years gone by.</p>

<p class='c013'>This accomplished, he stepped outside the
hangar, and beckoned to a couple of ground
workers who chanced to be close by, possibly
in anticipation of their services being required,
with a tip in prospect.</p>

<p class='c013'>Between them the ship was moved to the open,
and after that it would be a simple thing for
Jack to taxi across the strip of ground adjoining
the big Pitcairn hangar, so as to face such
wind as was stirring.</p>

<p class='c013'>With what Perk had said concerning the new
Ryan monoplane and its crew still fresh in his
mind, Jack did give a brief glance in that quarter.
He could only see that both men were fully
equipped with dungarees, helmets, and even
chutes fastened to their backs; which combination
was an effectual disguise, since their best
friends might have failed to recognize either
of them offhand.</p>

<p class='c013'>The one who was garbed in what seemed to
be fresh clean overalls, and who must be the
employer, seemed to feel a mild interest in their
movements, for he was looking that way through
his goggles, that had been pulled down as if in
preparation for some species of flight. The
other was busying himself adjusting something,
and from his greasy dungarees it was evident
he must be the working pilot of the Ryan craft.</p>

<p class='c013'>With all the bustle that was going on covering
the stunt flying and speed races, Jack did
not bother taking a second look; he failed to
have the same interest in the possible sporting
excursion of the unknown pair that had gripped
Perk and hence failed to let the matter occupy
any more of his limited time.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon both settled down in their respective
places in the double cockpit of the ship,
Jack of course occupying the front seat, since
he had been placed in command, with the other
acting as co-pilot and observer.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a very decent crate taken in all, that
had been secured for their work on this special
occasion, for Uncle Sam is never stingy in supplying
his agents of the Secret Service with
whatever they need, from means for swift travel
to the customary “grub” necessary to their upkeep
when “on the road.” These air detectives
in whom we are particularly interested just now,
as a rule were angling for big fish, and it was
absolutely necessary they should be given a free
hand when making their demands for proper
backing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it’s goodbye to Candler Field for us
right now,” remarked Perk, as he shot a general
look around, being more or less interested in
the exciting events being pulled off in the air
circus. “Playtime’s past, and now we’ve just
got to put in our best licks along the line of
business. Huh! seems like them two guys are
meaning to pull out right on our heels, from the
lively way that greasy lad is jumping around—keeps
an eye on us in the bargain, as if it mattered
a lick whether we did get going before
he was ready to follow suit. Some folks never
do like anybody to show ’em their dust, even
when it don’t matter a pinch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then Jack waved his hand toward the two
hostlers whom he had generously tipped, and
pulled the gun in his accustomed careful fashion;
after which they started along the level
field for the takeoff, there being small necessity
for a runway on such a generous fairway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Faster and faster they flew along the ground,
and then with their wheels parting contact with
the earth up they started at an easy incline.
The roar of the motor already drowned most of
the clamor from the surging crowd, while the
racket of the whizzing propeller added to the
chorus so joyous to the ears of all real air pilots,
since nothing pleases them more than to feel they
are masters of a ship that is in “apple-pie” condition
for battling whatever lies ahead, be it
storm, fog or whatnot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Somehow Perk was twisting his head around
as if curious to ascertain whether that Ryan
crate had succeeded in imitating their example,
and was already making the preliminary dash
across the field—which luckily enough had
chanced to be fairly clear of maneuvering
planes, either descending, taking off, or being
taxied into position for the next stunt on the
program.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was getting well along by this
time, and already the first dim shadows of approaching
night were to be seen slipping
out from certain patches of pine trees ahead.
But the higher they climbed, now that a start
had been accomplished, the lighter it would become,
what with a lower horizon, and the sun
still hanging in plain sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once free from any possibility of any contact
with the wheeling and ducking planes—some of
which were doing the barrel roll, and others
making successive somersaults, with the daring
pilots proceeding while in an inverted position—Jack
could start spiraling, and climbing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rapidly was Candler Field fading from view
behind them since Jack had swung toward the
south, as if to lay his course directly for New
Orleans. Perk seemed to find a subtle attraction
back where they had just come from, since he
was again turning his head with nothing else to
do save gratify his innocent curiosity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! ’pears like they might be meaning to
strike for the Louisiana canebrake country, and
black bear diggings, just like I said,” he was
telling himself, with a chuckle of amusement
over his shrewd guess. “And say, that little
Ryan crate’s no slouch ’bout making speed, I’d
mention. Come along you sportin’ crowd—plenty
of room in the ceiling overhead, an’ nixey
a chance to bring about a collision. Take your
choice, and cut out for all you’re worth, boys.
If you get there before we do, just tell ’em we’re
acomin’ too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk continued to amuse himself in watching
the antics of the rival ship, and indulging in
all kinds of wild speculations as to what the real
object of those two sporty looking occupants
might prove to be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently thus far not the slightest suspicion
had entered his mind that the taking to the air
of the shining Ryan boat had the first thing to
do with their own skipping out, and heading
toward the Crescent City.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like as not when it gets real dark after a
bit,” Perk continued to say, being addicted to
talking to himself more or less, “we’ll soon lose
her, and have the field all to ourselves. Only
moving thing I c’n sight back there, ’cept them
circlin’ buzzards huntin’ for a carrion supper.
Guess everything’s going along first class
and we’re in for a comfortable night run down
over the corn and sugarcane country. This is
the life for little Perk, you hear me saying,
everybody—it’s got the boxin’ game, and even
that outdoor life up with the Mounties in Canada,
beat to a frazzle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk busied himself with his duties for
some time, and presently became aware of the
fact that evening was actually at hand; for the
sun had dropped out of sight over in the far
west, and looking down he found it absolutely
impossible to distinguish what lay beneath them
some two thousand feet more or less earthward—there
might be forests, farms, hills or swales
following each other in rapid succession; but all
masked by the sable curtains of night. When
the moon rose later on, its light would not afford
them any opportunity for marking any peculiarities
of the ground down there, since it must
simply present the appearance of a swiftly moving
panorama.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, moved once more by his old curiosity
concerning the ship that had started off immediately
after their own jump, again twisted his
head so as to take another backward look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hanged if she ain’t keeping on our tail right
along,” he told himself, as if a bit surprised,
though not in the least troubled, since there
could be no possible connection between this
Ryan monoplane and their own old bus, bent
on reeling off so many miles per hour, and aiming
to make the airport at New Orleans by early
dawn or before, according to how the weather
treated them, and the speed Jack could coax
from his aerial steed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Further inspection convinced Perk that the
rival ship was neither gaining nor losing as the
two sped along their way; a fact that began to
make him “sit up and take notice,” and then
express himself confidentially:</p>

<p class='c013'>“By jinks! it looks to me like that clever little
Ryan bus could make circles around our tub
’less Jack c’n squeeze a lot more snap from our
Whirlwind motor. Now what game c’n that
pair of sports be playin’ right now, I want to
know—must be they’re so used to bettin’ on
anything an’ everything they’re meanin’ to keep
right on our tail all night long, just to make us
hump along, and get the laugh on us poor
guys.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c014'>CHAPTER IV <br /> <br />THE GRIM PURSUER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>As the minutes crept along Perk’s uneasiness
commenced to make itself more manifest, finally
reaching such a condition that he felt it would
ease his mind if only he could get the opinion
of his companion on the subject.</p>

<p class='c013'>To do this it would be necessary that they
should make use of the head earphones that had
been taken along for this particular purpose.
Accordingly he quickly adjusted his own, and
then proceeded to advise Jack as to what he
wished to do. Since these useful adjuncts of the
pilot’s outfit were so arranged that they could
be slipped on and off with little loss of time,
it was an easy matter for Perk to apply them,
after which he went on to speak.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, seems like that pesky little Ryan insect’s
been tailing us right along, though mebbe
now you didn’t notice it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know it, Perk—fact is I proved that fact
to my own satisfaction, for twice now I’ve
changed our course, once into the west, and
again heading into the southwest, even if it
didn’t catch your attention.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You did that same; and say, what happened,
Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a blessed thing,” came the immediate
answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They still hung on our tail, do you mean,
old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like they did—queer how two pilots,
strangers both, would take a notion to change
their course, not once but twice running,” commented
Jack in his non-committal fashion that
always had Perk guessing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Strikes me as something more than a happy
chance,” asserted Perk, beginning to throw off
that comfortable feeling with which he had
wrapped himself as he contemplated a steady
going night run, with never a reason for anything
gripping them by way of excitement;
“ev’ry little movement of that Ryan two-seater’s
got a meanin’ of its own. Now what ails the
ducks I want to know—how c’n our movements
have a mite to do with what they’re planning
to carry out—got any idea along them lines, old
hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing definite as yet,” answered Jack; “I
was starting to figure it out just when you barged
in, and opened this talk fest up with your question.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, come to think of it, what did you make
out of that stiff yarn Scotty put over on us a
while ago?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was raw stuff for a fact; but I don’t question
anything he told us, remember, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whoever his mysterious visitor was he must
have been hunting for something, that’s dead
sure!” declared Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Something he didn’t find, either,” continued
Jack’s assistant pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Scotty was ready to swear to that fact, and
he ought to know.” Jack countered by saying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“But see here, old hoss, you’ve got some sorter
idea what the game might abeen, haven’t you
for a fact?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon I know why the sneak thief failed
to carry away the thing he was looking for, if
that’s what you mean, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As what, boss—I’m all worked up wantin’
to know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perhaps the reason might have been because
the object of his search happened at that very
time to be safe and snug in the inside pocket
of this same coat I’m wearing under my overalls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At hearing this startling announcement Perk
gave a quick look into his pal’s face, there being
just enough light remaining in the western sky
to allow this searching glance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! now I’m beginning to get somewhere,
and ready to quit this gropin’ around,
like a man in a London fog—that letter you had
this very morning from Headquarters—somehow
’r other some of the gang had wind of your
gettin’ it, and they guessed it’d be kept
safe under lock and key in your room at the
hotel; and then they got balled up about the
number on the door, so they broke into the wrong
room. Jack, am I on the right track?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems that’s so, according to my notion,
Perk; unless I miss my guess that’s the way
things stand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A disgusted grunt from Perk told that he did
not feel very happy over certain facts in the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gosh-a-mighty!” he burst out, explosively,
“if that’s right, then the tricky crowd know you’n
me are on this case—that even right now we’re
starting out to pluck their tail feathers, and
fetch that master-crook to the bar!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! I expected that would happen,” said
Jack, indifferently. “Having been told by several
of the best men in the service that Slim was
the smartest all-round dopester known in all the
land, I anticipated that he’d have means for
finding out that fact long ago—that there might
be a leak around Headquarters; for spies can
worm in almost anywhere, given an opportunity,
and the backing of a big bunch of jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yet that fact don’t seem to rattle you worth
a red cent, old hoss,” continued the puzzled
Perk, who ofttimes found the actions of his cool
partner a mystery he could not solve, because of
his own more impetuous ways.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope not,” was all Jack said in reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thunder and lightning!” ejaculated the co-pilot,
as if an illuminating idea had suddenly
flashed through his brain—“that Ryan bus,
Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what of it?” demanded the one at the
stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What if that sporty guy I told you about
should turn out to be the critter who broke into
Scotty’s room, and made it a complete wreck?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It could happen that way, Perk; seems like
you’re working on a warm scent right now. Pity
we didn’t get a good look at the gentleman before
he hid his face behind that helmet and goggles;
then at least we’d know him if ever we happened
to run across his trail.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The other was almost frothing at the mouth
through disgust and anger combined; but he
managed to say, with a select few hard words
interlarded as a vent to his outraged feelings:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Give me half a chance and I’ll mark him so
there’s be no difficulty in locating the sneak when
we meet him again—I’d put a bit of lead
through his arm that’d keep him out of the scrap
for a week of Sundays; or else clip off one of
his ears, to stamp him as a low-down crook.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack knew full well that this was no idle threat
on the part of his running mate; for Perk had a
reputation as a pistol shot second to none in the
entire service, being a natural born marksman.</p>

<p class='c013'>He lapsed into a spell of silence after making
that vicious remark; but from the way he
glanced back again and again it looked as
though Perk meant to keep close tabs on the
craft that was dogging their own ship so
steadily.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were roaring on their way, and it would
seem as if they must be showing a clean pair of
heels to anything in their rear; but just the same,
Perk, with the vision of an air-minded individual,
could readily understand how the speedy
Ryan plane was slowly but insidiously picking
up on them continuously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blamed nuisance,” he was muttering to himself
when this important fact became a positive
truth; “guess now that rip-snorter could make
circles round us, if so be he wanted to. Shucks!
what’s left to us I want to know; an’ just what
does he ’spect to accomplish with all this chasin’
us? Might as well get out my little old
six-shot bear gun, so’s to be ready in case
there’s any sort o’ ruction aheadin’ our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The idea seemed to afford him a strange sort
of grim satisfaction, for bending down he ran
his hand under the coaming of the cockpit; to
almost immediately withdraw a very decent
looking sporting repeating rifle, evidently his
working tool whenever he felt disposed to spend
a week in the wilds, either alone, or with some
boon companions also yearning for wild game
and the much desired campfire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold tight, Perk,” Jack was saying just
then; “going into a nose dive, and see if that
will upset his calculations; for he’s got me buffaloed
all right as to what’s in the wind!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Almost immediately they turned the nose of
their craft earthward, and went down on a
swift slant. Perk kept his head turned even as
this maneuvre was being executed, and what he
saw was something calculated to almost take
his breath away; for where the pursuing Ryan
ship loomed up as a shadowy form, vivid
splashes, as of fire, were coming in quick succession—he
could even imagine he heard the pulsating
staccato reports following each other in
succession, just as in those never-to-be-forgotten
days when he would have a covey of
devil-may-care German air fighters stepping on
the tail of his old-fashioned boat, and peppering
him from their rapid-firing guns!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c014'>CHAPTER V <br /> <br />THE DUEL IN THE AIR</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The significant flashes abruptly ceased; but
Perk realized this was only because the expert
pilot handling that same Ryan wasp was also
ducking down in an exact copy of their own
game.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the moment Perk lost sight of the shadowy
pursuing craft; then Jack changed his tactics,
and once again brought his boat on an even
keel. Perk strained his eyesight in an endeavor
to pick up the other ship after it too had swung
into a direct course.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Devil take that guy at the stick,” he stormed
to himself, although Jack caught almost every
word, since the earphones were still in operation,
“he’s seen our move, an’ gone us one better.
No slouch o’ a pilot, either, I’ll admit. When
that gent who goes by the name o’ Slippery Slim
picks his gang he knows how to pull trumps
out of the pack all right. Give him another
shoot, Jack, old hoss; mebbe he wont be so lucky
next time. He’s got some kind o’ a rapid-fire
shooter aboard, and had started to send a hail
o’ lead ’bout our ears just as you turned the trick
on him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was apparently quite willing to give a
repeat, for hardly had the other ceased shouting
than they again shot down in a dizzy dive
that seemed likely to lower their altitude by
something like five hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was keeping a close watch, and knew
that once more the grim pursuer had copied
their daring maneuvre.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s a good one, or I’ll eat my hat!” he burst
out, as they were “cutting a blue streak” once
more through the growing darkness, and he
could see those suggestive flashes again punctuating
the gloom in their track. “Jack, he’s
started that racket again, don’t you know; and
any second we may get a slug in our belly, bustin’
things all to flinders. Try a razzle-dazzle on
the boob, old broncho!”</p>

<p class='c013'>So making a bank, Jack changed his course,
running at right angles, and if anything at a
faster pace than ever. Perk had the situation
“sized up to a fraction,” as he himself would
have called it; he realized that it was only
through the greatest of good luck they had escaped
being hit by one of those flying missiles;
and that so long as the mysterious enemy kept
using their ship for a flying target they were in
constant peril. Despite all this ducking and
dodging on Jack’s part he did not seem successful
in throwing the pursuing craft off the track.
To be sure the darkness was gradually growing
thicker with every passing minute, and this
seemed to be their only hope of crawling out of
a “hot hole,” according to Perk’s calculations.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk afterwards frankly admitted that he was
frothing at the mouth on account of finding himself
up against a situation where the cards
seemed stacked against him—where his hands
were tied as it were, and that reckless pilot, chasing
after them hell-bent, held all the trumps.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No use tryin’ that game any longer, Jack,
boy!” he yelled suddenly. “See the glim all
’round us, partner—sure as you live they’ve
even got some kind o’ a searchlight aboard, just
like they’d planned all this thing out beforehand.
Guess now it’s up to Little Perk to put
a plug into their game. Hold her steady a bit,
boss; I’m meaning to make ’em sit up an’ take
notice they can’t hog <i>all</i> the fun going. Watch
my smoke, Jack, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a delicate situation without any doubt;
for if those aboard that little Ryan plane, taking
advantage of the halo of light covering the craft
they followed, continued to make use of their
rapidfire gun, the danger of a hit had vastly increased;
but Perk must have some sort of scheme
in mind it was evident, or he would never have
asked his chum to steady the badly wobbling
boat when such action only doubled their peril.</p>

<p class='c013'>Calmly and deliberately, as though simply
bent on fetching down a deer he wanted for
his next camp supper, steady old Perk had his
faithful gun up to his shoulder, and was sighting
that piercing glare of light that marked the bow
of the pursuing aircraft, betraying the presence
of a searchlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Possibly owing to the clamor of their own
working motor Jack could not tell when his
companion unloosed a fusilade of shots; but he
did know that something suddenly changed the
situation, and to their advantage; for as though
a blanket had been tossed over the piercing
ray the illumination abruptly ceased, leaving
them to continue their wild flight shrouded in
encompassing darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, too, the sound of Perk’s exulting yell
was quite enough to tell the story of his success
in finding a glowing target for one of his several
missiles—the old sharpshooter had evidently
lost none of his cunning by reason of a lapse in
action.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Set ’em up in the other alley, boys—give your
Dutch uncle a chance to show an old trick or
two! Now <i>will</i> you be good, or must I give
you another smash in the jaw—better haul off
while the haulin’s good, fellers—I’d sure hate to
make you crack up, and fade out!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Even though his clever shot had doubtless
utterly smashed the searchlight, and put it out
of business, that bothersome rapidfire gun was
still in working order, as Perk discovered when
once more those insistent flashes, following closely
upon each others’ heels, announced a fresh
barrage, with the unseen, unheard hissing bullets
doubtless whizzing all around them.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was adding insult to injury, Perk was
doubtless telling himself, as he realized that his
lucky shot had after all failed to daunt that
stubborn pair in the speedy Ryan ship.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You <i>will</i> have it, seems like,” he growled
to himself; for since he had discarded his earphone
harness just previous to starting his late
“shooting spree,” Perk could no longer hold
intercourse with his fellow flyer; “all right then,
I’ll try some more o’ the same sorter medicine;
what’s good for the goose orter be fine for the
gander. Mind your eye now, boys, and keep
a tight grip on your chutes if anything happens
not down in your gamble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again did the continual flash of spitting fire
from the gun afford the sharpshooter in the
chased ship abundant opportunities for focussing
his aim; although instinct may have
taken the place of vision on Perk’s part.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fortunately Jack must have been expecting
something along those lines, knowing his companion
so well, and how he was always eager
to “repeat” when things were coming his way;
for he kept the flying boat wonderfully steady
just then, even though realizing how such action
doubled their own chances of being hit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was now shooting on general principles,
in hopes of being fortunate enough to find a
billet for one of his random bullets. He went
at the business with all the <i>sang froid</i> of a veteran
fighter, accustomed to meeting hostile
craft up in the wide air spaces, or even above
the clouds—all the fierce delight of matching
his skill and life against a foeman worthy of his
steel had once more gripped the old flying warrior;
and it may be for the moment he deluded
himself with the belief that this was but a reincarnation
of those never-to-be-forgotten days
when all Europe was held fast in the throes of
the grisly war-god.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly Perk ceased firing, nor was this
caused by the magazine of his repeating rifle
being empty—he had seen that the discharges
back yonder were no longer in full blast, showing
that something must have happened to cause
such a sudden cessation to hostilities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before he could attempt to analyze what this
might mean it was all flashed before his questioning
mind—a burst of flames came from the
spot where last he had seen the shadowy shape
of their persistent pursuer clipping through
space like a blazing meteor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk sat there doubled up, his mouth half
open, staring with might and main, as some
object began to drop toward the earth with ever
increasing speed—something which he knew
full well must of necessity be the beautiful little
Ryan plane, which he had admired so much
when at Candler Field at close of the late day,
and before this wild dash into the darkness of
night began.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently one of his missiles (fired with such
grim determination when he “took the bit in
his teeth,” and struck back) had found its mark,
and unleashed the dangerous contents of the
gasoline reservoir, with the splashing fluid instantly
catching fire from the exploding spark
of the running motor.</p>

<p class='c013'>No flyer ever saw his enemy going down in a
flaming coffin without feeling compassion gripping
him; that one moment had changed his
heart from bitter hatred to a sense of pity; knowing
as he must have done that the day might
be near at hand when he too would share in a
similar dreadful fate.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so Perk found himself all in a nervous
tremble as, laying down his gun, he managed
once more to adjust the head harness, so as to
be able to again hold communication with his
fellow adventurer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c014'>CHAPTER VI <br /> <br />PARACHUTE JUMPERS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Just then Jack hurriedly banked, and swung
around as though to double back on their late
course. This of course told Perk the pilot must
be already aware of the terrible tragedy that
was being enacted close at hand, and meant to
see its finish with his own eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the abrupt change in their course he
was in time to catch a glimpse of the flaming
object still spiraling earthwards, a billow of fire
that glowed suggestively in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then far below it seemed to strike the ground—they
heard no sound whatever, but the fire
became stationary; although increasing in fury,
since the wind created by its passage no longer
whipped the devouring flames. Evidently by
the time the conflagration stopped for want of
further material on which to feed, nothing inflammable
would be left of the once haughty
little Ryan masterpiece save the engine, and
other metal parts.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the big idea, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk asked this as a leader, wishing to get a
better grip on his own nerves, since they had
been dreadfully shocked at the dire result of his
random shot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Going to circle around a few times, and drop
down a bit,” came the illuminating reply;
“though I reckon it’s no use, since nothing could
live in all that awful blast.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe not, Jack,” remarked Perk, a bit
cheerily; “but there’s a fair chance neither o’
them guys got snagged in the flash o’ that gas.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Perk, have you some foundation
for saying that?” demanded the other, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure—they jumped all right, boss,” Perk
told him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You saw them do it then, did you, boy?”
continued Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They bailed out okay—I saw two take the
jump right after the first flash came—went down
like plummets in the bargain—smart lads those
guys are, I’m tellin’ you, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>No doubt Jack was glad to hear this bit of
news, for it had filled him with horror to realize
that in order to escape they had been compelled
to ruthlessly take human life. He was
much younger than Perk, veteran of the World
War, who had grown more or less hardened
to such happenings when staking his own life
against that of a tricky German air pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Still goin’ down, are you?” asked Perk shortly
afterwards, on finding that they were still
swinging around in a wide circle, that burning
pyre far below being the hub of the wheel of
which their boat was the outer tire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Might as well,” came the ready answer,
showing that Jack had made up his mind
hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess now they’ll get down somehow, boss;
a whole lot depends on what kind o’ landin’
they’ll be able to make—if its rocks, or trees,
they got to strike it’s apt to be some hard sleddin’
for the boys. Say, ’taint possible now you’re
fixin’ to try an’ lend ’em a helpin’ hand? I’d
hate to know they’d been wiped off the map in
that hot fire; but somehow I don’t feel like
playin’ the part o’ the Good Samaritan to such
man devils as them two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No danger of my trying to make a landing
where the chances are ten to one it just <i>can’t</i> be
done,” explained Jack, seeing that his companion
was almost ready to mutiny if any such mad
proceeding were contemplated. “I’d just feel
better if I knew they’d reached ground okay;
then we could keep on our way, and it’d be up
to them to get out of the scrape.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! I get you, partner,” grunted the relieved
Perk. “Don’t think I’m bitter about the
thing, ’cause they’re sure hot stuff all right; but
I’m a bit slow to accept that forgive and forget
stuff, specially after any guy’s tried his level
best to gimme a dirty deal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll try the thing out while on the job,”
Jack announced. “Our own wonderful escape
from meeting just that same kind of fate makes
me kind of soft. Perhaps we’ll not be able to
learn a single thing; you know how it often is
when you’ve finally struck ground after quitting
the ship by the chute route—all out of breath—sometimes
knocked up a bit, if you escape broken
bones—not any shape to shout, or do anything
but just lie there, and suck in the air in big
gasps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, that’s right for you, old hoss,” Perk
readily agreed. “Me, I once got a collar bone
smashed that way. No harm in our makin’ a
few swings around these diggin’s ’fore we put
out for Orleans. That fire keeps burnin’ like
things they got sprinkled right well with the
juice when the tank blew up. Go to it, Jack,
just as you please, never mindin’ a few squeals
from a hard-boiled guy like Perk Perkiser.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m going to shut down on the engine, and
take a little glide, so we can pick up anything
like a yell,” announced the pilot a minute later.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to it—duck then, boy!” snapped Perk,
as he temporarily relieved himself of his ear-phones
in order to catch anything bordering on
a shout from the ground below.</p>

<p class='c013'>The simple expedient was carried out successfully,
and when once again they leveled out,
to continue circling, Jack asked eagerly:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get anything, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a bleat, partner,” replied the other, who
had hurriedly held his earphones in position so
as to cover the emergency.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sorry for that, but we’ll try a couple more
times before calling it all off,” suggested Jack,
who could be more or less persistent when the
occasion arose for such action, though never
carrying it so far as to be reckless.</p>

<p class='c013'>So a dozen seconds or so afterwards he again
gave warning that it was time for another drop
of a few hundred feet—not that they meant to
take any chances by getting too close to the unknown
terrain lying in the pitch blackness under
the flying ship; but simply to be able to listen
with the horrid clamor of the bustling engine
momentarily stilled.</p>

<p class='c013'>No better success followed this second maneuvre—all
was deathly silent around, above,
below, as though never a solitary living human
being existed within miles of the spot where
the destruction of the Ryan monoplane had
taken place.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll give a third and last try,” was Jack’s
announced decision, to which Perk added:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Three times, and batter’s out—by then I rather
guess we’ll be down close enough to the solid
ground to make another drop dangerous. Either
way I’m satisfied we’ve done the right thing,
old hoss. Suit yourself when you see fit to
coast,” whereupon he once more denuded his
ears of the exceedingly useful and really indispensable
phone harness, to await the occasion
of the last try in the line of an aviator’s
duty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it, Perk?—get a whisper?”</p>

<p class='c013'>They had completed the glide, and were once
more on a level course, with Jack even turning
the nose of the ship a bit heavenward; since
neither of them knew what the nature of the
ground below must be—whether some hill lay
directly ahead, against which they might smash
for a complete wipeout.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! a heap more’n that, partner!” came
the triumphant reply. “Heard a shout, an’ then
another some distance off—struck me both
jumpers had lit okay, and were tryin’ to communicate,
so’s to get together again. Guess
things ain’t so bad after all with them guys, an’
we c’n be movin’ on our way without botherin’
any more ’bout their safety. Some two-legged
varmints seem to be watched over by Old Satan
hisself, they bein’ that venomous, and evil-minded.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack made no rejoinder to this remark, tinged
with bitterness as it was, only pointed the nose
of his craft upward, and started to spiral for
altitude. Undoubtedly he was feeling greatly
relieved because of their having escaped so
miraculously from the hovering peril; and best
of all managed to turn the tables on those who
would have encompassed their destruction just
in order to defend the lawless game in which
they were engaged in connection with Slippery
Slim.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk must have been doing a little hard thinking
as the time passed and they raced on their
way, for later on he started to speak; and as
usual his line of chatter told that he was seeking
information, trying to find a solution of
certain exasperating puzzles that were “twisting
his intellects,” as he himself described
matters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Things kind o’ got me goofy, partner, an’
I’d like you to raise the curtain some, if so be
you feel so bent. First place I guess it goes
without questionin’ that these huskies must be
in cohunks with that there big gun, Slippery
Slim Garrabrant?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! that’s a dead certainty—who else would
have any reason for waylaying us in Atlanta,
and setting up this trap for us to fall into?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! then it stands to reason, boss, he’s
got means for findin’ out what the Secret Service
aims to do; an’ so has been able to play the boys
for suckers every time they set out to lay him
by the heels, eh, Jack, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s past history, Perk; even the Big Boss
got wise to it, and tried everything possible to
learn where the great leak happened; but our
experience proves they haven’t discovered it so
far. I’m making up my mind that the closer
we draw to the headquarters of this rotten clique
of crime, where they make the bogus long-green
that’s been flooding the whole West for a year
and more, why, the harder our job is bound
to be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which tickles me a heap, boy—I’m just
yearnin’ for comin’ to grips with that gazaboo
o’ a Slim; and now we’re on to the job I’ll never
be happy ’till he’s on his way to that big Government
pen we glimpsed in Atlanta, where
some other lads we helped to pinch are doin’
time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if you keep on as you’ve started, Perk,
we’ll flatten the whole gang like pancakes—they’ve
stacked up against a new sort of revenue
dog when they started a shooter of your calibre
on the trail. First you smashed their searchlight,
and then sent a chuck of lead into the
gas tank that broke up the game. That’s the
kind of a pinch hitter you are, partner; and
right now I want to congratulate you on such
dandy marksmanship.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lay off that stuff, Jack—nothin’ but great
luck fetched the bacon home for this lad. But
me, I’m shakin’ hands with myself ’cause I
had that hunch a bear gun mightn’t be such a
bad thing to tote along on a trip that’s goin’ to
carry us across the border, an’ into Old Mex,
like as not; where the greasers are sometimes
tough nuts an’ hard to handle they tell me.
’Spose we’ll run across them two hill billies
again, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wouldn’t surprise me a bit if we did,” replied
the pilot, leveling off at a three thousand
foot ceiling, and still heading due southwest.
“Like as not they’ve got plenty of ready cash
along; and after having been so cleverly upset in
their calculations, due to your beating them silly
with a barrage of hot lead, they’ll be hot to wipe
out their disgrace. Oh! yes, we’re going to run
up against that foxey pair again before the book
is closed for keeps.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c014'>CHAPTER VII <br /> <br />STRIKING THE FOG BELT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>With the stars shining brightly above them,
and a moon just past its full climbing the eastern
heavens, having dissipated the darkness of the
earlier part of the night, Jack and his fellow
voyager continued plunging along in a very
satisfactory fashion, having no reason for feeling
further concern regarding the peril to
which they had been so lately subjected.</p>

<p class='c013'>But things were not destined to continue so
comfortably for the two adventurers, it seemed.
Perk was just congratulating himself for about
the fourth time at having such a comfortable
flight, when he sat up and took notice of the
fact that those heavenly bodies were beginning
to look exceedingly hazy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Danged shame, that’s what, to spoil such a
dandy night!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What ails you now?” demanded Jack, on
hearing the other make this little remark that
bespoke exasperation at least; “another boat on
our tail?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I guess not just now,” replied Perk,
scoffingly; “one was more’n enough for a single
jump. But we’re agoin’ to run into a pesky
fog belt, sure as you’re born, old hoss!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That all?” laughed the other, who apparently
saw nothing of particular consequence
about such a common happening; “it may perhaps
manage to slow us down more or less; but
what does that matter, when we’ve got time to
burn. The Big Boss told us, remember, not to
hurry things at all—plenty of time, oodles of
money, and any backing we chose to call for in
the way of a new boat, or more helpers. We
should worry, old scout!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Tain’t that in peticular Jack,” complained
the other; “but of all things a sky detective’s got
to run smack up against, fog’s the one I despise
most. It’s got me in bad more’n a few times, so
I’ve grown to look on the peasoup stuff like it
was my—er, what-dye-call it—Nebraska, no, I
mean Nemesis.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, now you mention it, Perk, I remember
you telling me something about that strange feeling
you have creep over you. No need for you
to apologize—in my knocking around among airmen
I’ve found that often even the most daring
and reckless in the bunch had some kind of a
weakness, if only you looked far enough under
the surface; just as sometimes you’ll find a boasting
bully actually afraid of his little wife at
home, who’s smacked him with her handy rolling
pin many a time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! wasn’t I a canvas man ’long with a
travelin’ circus a wheen o’ years ago, an’ didn’t
I see the biggest elephant in captivity rear up
on his hind legs, lift his trunk sky-high in the
air, an’ squeal like fun just when a little half
grown mouse happened to run along near his
alley. Well, I’m the tusker, an’ fog is the
mouse, as you might say—we never do get on
well as a combine. Hope it hugs the ground,
an’ leaves us a clear track up among the clouds
I c’n see creepin’ up ahead yonder.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Doesn’t bother me a whit, partner; don’t
forget we’ve got that new radio beacon aboard
to try out; and if it’s as clever as I’ve heard tell
it’ll carry us along our route to Orleans through
the thickest nest of fog anybody ever stacked up
against. Naturally we can’t expect to get the
full benefit of its capacity to hold a speeding
plane on its true course; because the invention’s
hardly more than half baked up to now; but I
set it according to directions, and if at any time
we begin to slide off our course the light that
springs up is bound to give warning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A bully good layout I’d say, if it c’n do what
they claim,” ventured Perk, who undoubtedly
had read certain things concerning the new invention,
and was eager to learn just how it would
pan out. “You showed a level head, partner,
when you decided to take the offer o’ that gent
in Atlanta, and try the thing out. Guess, then,
I needn’t bother my head ’bout gettin’ astray;
if things keep bein’ invented it ain’t goin’ to be
very long till a pilot’ll get slapped good an’
hard if he misses runnin’ on a straight line, or
even veers from his proper course in a great big
blow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re living in a machine age, Perk, and
every day things are heading that way on the
run—electric helps in kitchen, factory, and even
aboard our air cruisers. While the brainwork
and strain grow harder the actual manual labor
is lessened all the time. But as you say it’s getting
a bit hazy, and chances are we’re in for a
spell of blue fog.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Ten minutes afterwards there could not be
the least doubt concerning that fact, for by degrees
even the stars vanished from view, ditto
the gorgeous round moon. Still, since the sky
remained brighter in the east, it was not at all
difficult to tell where the fair mistress of the
Southern night had hidden her face behind the
opaque veil.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was now flying by instruments alone,
since never a thing could be seen by the keenest
eye above, below—they seemed to be hung in
unlimited space; but pushing along with considerable
speed just the same, bound for the distant
city on the vast Mississippi, situated not so
very far from its delta.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus passed a full hour.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly Perk saw a small light spring into
view on one side of the plane, and it certainly
electrified him considerably.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hi! there, partner, we’re off our track—shifted
to the east, seems like, unless I’m away
wrong in sizin’ things up ’cordin’ to Hoyle.
Got to swing her to the larboard-watch side, I
kinder guess—how ’bout that, boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You hit it that time, Perk, and here she goes
to climb back to our true course. Worked just
as we figured it would, and put us wise to a fact
we’d hardly have picked up in any other way.
I reckon now this same radio beacon’s bound to
turn out a great help to the poor badgered air
pilot, flying blind when fog hides the ground
beacons, and he gets no aid from the heavens
above.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll say it’s the best thing I’ve struck for a
long time,” affirmed the delighted Perk.
“There she goes—the glim I mean—closed shop,
havin’ ’complished the business set for her;
showing we must have struck our real course
again.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Easy money,” laughed Jack, just as well satisfied.
“Makes a fellow sit up and try to guess
what the next big idea connected with aviation
will prove to be; doesn’t seem to be any limit to
the dazzling discoveries these scientific chaps’ll
turn out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, partner—like that big chute they’re
trying out, which they claim will keep any
plane from crashing—if the engine goes dead
all you got to do is to press a little button, and
when the drop comes open goes the monster umbrella,
able to hold you and the crate suspended
in the air, to gradually fall to the earth like the
colored balls from a bursted skyrocket. Great
stunt that, an’ I’m livin’ in hopes it’ll be my
luck to some day find myself aboard a ship that’s
equipped with such a giant chute, an’ have the
glorious experience of seeing the thing work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack seemed to consider it the part of wisdom
to pull up more or less, as they were in no hurry,
and could drop down on the aviation field at
New Orleans by dawn, even though they concluded
to just “loaf along.” Disliking anything
pertaining to fog Perk naturally said nothing
to hint at a desire for further speed; besides
his own good sense told him that what his mate
had just said with regard to no necessity existing
for haste, was sound logic, and a due regard
for “safety first.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So the time slipped away, with midnight finding
them past the meridian of their projected
flight. Perk had long since subsided and
seemed content to sit there in the double cockpit,
letting his thoughts roam back to the exciting
developments of the earlier night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Years had elapsed since last he watched a
doomed plane writhing and twisting in its death
agonies, with the flames wrapping it in an envelope—a
blazing coffin speeding headlong to a
final crash; and here, strange to say, after all
that time intervening he had again passed
through a similar experience. Now that he had
an opportunity to calmly review the happening,
Perk admitted he was pleased to know the two
occupants of the Ryan cockpit had apparently
escaped a miserable fate that must have been
laid at his door.</p>

<p class='c013'>Two A. M. and all’s well!</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk figured that when a few more times
sixty minutes had passed it would be time for
them to catch a first glimpse of the great rolling
turgid stream that could, when the heavy rains
united with the melting snows up in the mountains
of the Far West, create vast floods that
placed much of the low country along the river
under many feet of water. It had been a long
time since last Perk had set eyes on the Mississippi,
and hence he was considerably worked
up over the prospect of soon glimpsing the
mighty flood.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c014'>CHAPTER VIII <br /> <br />NEW ORLEANS—FIRST STOP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“There she rolls, Jack, old boy—the greatest
stream in the whole U.S.A.—I swan if she
don’t look just as fine as when I glimpsed her
for the first time many years ago!”</p>

<p class='c013'>That was Perk’s tribute on beholding the
Lower Mississippi perhaps thirty miles above
New Orleans; he displayed almost as much enthusiasm
as those early discoverers did centuries
back, when their distended eyes took in the
mighty sweep of the flood rolling down toward
its junction with the Mexican Gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was early dawn, and the fog bank had been
dissipated by a fresh breeze acting as advance
courier to the rising of the sun. Jack, looking
toward the southwest could also see the object
of his companion’s exultation, and undoubtedly
felt some of the same pleasure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When it gets a bit lighter we’ll have a far distant
view of the city, with its smoke cloud hovering
over it,” he remarked, knowing that soft coal
and southern pine as used for fuel in the Fall
and Winter seasons always caused something of
a pall to mark the site of the river metropolis.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk reached around, and drew forth a case
that on being opened disclosed a pair of pretty
decent binoculars, with which they had been
fitted out by the Washington authorities before
starting on this particular man-hunt, with an
idea that they might prove most useful sooner
or later.</p>

<p class='c013'>After clapping these to his eyes Perk announced
that he could easily pick up the goal
of their flight from Candler Field; although the
smoke did act as a screen, through which it was
not possible to see with certainty.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was now bringing out all the reserve
speed of their ship—it was of some consequence
that they make a landing as early as possible,
since he had no desire to attract undue attention,
and possibly have inquisitive newspaper reporters
to be asking pertinent questions as to
whence they came, what their identities might
be when at home, and also concerning the object
of their coming to New Orleans. Secrecy
was the foundation on which they meant to
build their plans; and from their previous experience
with those dare devils in the employ of
Slippery Slim, too much care could not be employed
in order to mask their batteries.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, too, as they approached the city Jack was
dropping down to lower levels; while on his part
Perk skimmed the whole scene, looking for the
airport they knew to be somewhere within reach
of their vision.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being presently located he called his
chum’s attention to the open field, and in almost
no time they were circling it, looking for the
best place to land.</p>

<p class='c013'>Early though it was there were moving figures
circulating around, while some sort of ship
was coming in from over the river—possibly one
of the air mail carriers from a distant station, it
might be many hundred miles away, fetching
Uncle Sam’s important letter sacks, and worthwhile
express matter, at treble the speed that the
fastest train could muster.</p>

<p class='c013'>The landing was effected without the slightest
difficulty, and hardly had their boat come
to a stop than a number of persons, most of them
connected with the ground force of mechanicians
and hostlers, surrounded the incoming
craft, paying but scant attention to the air mail,
which dropped down almost at the same moment—that
was a daily happening, a following
out of a regular schedule, to which they had
become accustomed; while the arrival of a mysterious
plane might stand for almost anything.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold fast, Perk!” said Jack, as he took off
his headphones, and raising his voice to almost
a shout, so deaf did he appear after a whole
night’s run; “don’t tumble out yet; and keep a
muffler on your gab, for we’ve got to let ’em
take it out in guessing. I’ll soon see if the
party we’re expecting to meet is on hand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He still kept his helmet and goggles in position
as he thrust his head out of the cockpit, and
raising his right hand with two fingers extended,
made a species of salute. A stout man,
with a very red face, and an air of importance,
immediately pushed through the gathering
crowd, and answered Jack’s signal with a similar
sweep of his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s okay, Perk—that’s our party, and he’s
been watching for us, showing he had my wire
last evening. Get a move on, and we’ll soon be
doubling our legs under a breakfast table.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! but that will be a joy to me,
old hoss!” Perk exclaimed; “’cause I’m as
hungry as a wolf, an’ the smell o’ coffee is apt
to set me wild. Go to it, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was paying no attention to these vaporings,
since it was a common occurrence to have
old Perk declare the bottom of his stomach was
in danger of falling out—he had met the red-faced
gentleman and they were shaking hands
as they exchanged a few words.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all fixed, comrade,” he said to Perk over
his shoulder, mentioning no names lest suspicious
ears catch them, and thus have a clue as
to their identity; “we’ll get a few of these boys
to run our boat into a hangar close by, which is
waiting for us, and then cut out for the city—and grub.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This being speedily carried out, with the
doors fastened securely, and the two flyers began
to hastily divest themselves of their working
“duds.” Before ten minutes had passed
they were on their way in a taxi the gentleman
friend had brought out, with Jack and their
host talking at a great rate; while as for Perk
he was looking out, and finding more or less enjoyment
in seeing new and novel sights along
the road.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk having been well coached as to the
necessity for caution, made it a practice to snatch
an occasional glance in their rear, looking for
any signs to indicate that their car was being
trailed; but nothing at all suspicious came to
his attention.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meantime Jack had learned that their new
friend (whose name he already knew to be Mr.
Adkins) was connected with the Administration
forces of the United States District Attorney,
having offices in the Government building—that
he had been secretly advised of their coming
days before receiving Jack’s wire; and was
ready to give them all the information possible
concerning what had been learned in connection
with the wholesale operations of the man they
had been sent out to cage, so as to effectually
remove the greatest menace that had threatened
business men of the Southwest in a decade.</p>

<p class='c013'>In due time he would post them regarding
all these important facts; meanwhile they
could take things easy, for there was no hurry,
and the game was of too much importance to
allow lax methods. When they got good and
ready they could make a start, and after that
everything must depend on their ability to beat
Slippery Slim at his favorite game of “dog eat
dog.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He steered his guests to a certain restaurant
where he knew they could be well taken care
of, and which turned out to be close to the hotel
at which they booked under fictitious names.
Here Perk was given the privilege of ordering
just what he desired along the line of rashers of
bacon and fried eggs; cornbread with syrup;
several cups of coffee taken black; and to top off
with, a Havana cigar such as he was not accustomed
to smoking, being addicted to the more
friendly pipe habit.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no talk of shop while they partook
of breakfast; such business as they had to transact
was of too delicate a nature to be discussed
in a public place, where strangers would be
coming and going, and spying eyes might be on
them every minute of the time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Later they gathered in the room at the hotel
where, behind closed and locked doors they felt
free to confer in lowered tones.</p>

<p class='c013'>Much had to be told, and numerous thrilling
accounts brought out connected with adventures
experienced by other Secret Service men in their
efforts to round up the notorious gang—all of
which had resulted in absolute defeat for the
Government agents.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shrewd men some of these parties undoubtedly
were, with a record of numerous famous
cases successfully carried through; but somehow
when they found themselves up against
Slippery Slim Garrabrant they sooner or later
fell down on the job, and had to be recalled.</p>

<p class='c013'>In fact, it was disclosed to Jack and his pal,
two different agents were never again heard
from, after secret code messages had been received
from them to the effect that they were
even then getting very close to a great discovery
that must end in the arrest of the malefactor—a
dead silence that had never been broken
seemed to signify that they must have fallen into
some sort of fiendish trap, possibly meeting with
a gruesome fate that would be forever shrouded
in blank mystery.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins, watching closely as he narrated
these uncomfortable facts, was pleased to see
that neither of his interested auditors displayed
the least sign of being disturbed, showing that
they had long since discounted everything along
this line.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c014'>CHAPTER IX <br /> <br />COACHING PERK</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Of course it was in keeping with this exchange
of confidences that Jack should relate all that
had happened to them since their arrival in
Atlanta to secure the ship awaiting them, load
it to capacity for a long voyage, and finally start
off from Candler Field.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins listened eagerly to this modest
account of what had already happened to them
as a starter in the hunt they had undertaken;
and he was visibly thrilled at hearing of the
bitter night chase, the desperate tactics undertaken
by the pair of human wolves aboard the
Ryan monoplane; and particularly when Jack
finally described in vivid language the astounding
act of Perk in first shattering the bothersome
searchlight, to follow this with his lucky
random shot that bore into the gas tank of the
pursuing craft and brought about an explosion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Possibly the urbane gentleman had never in
all his life listened to so ghastly a true story as
the graphic one thus modestly related by one
of the two participants; looking at them, with
Jack so calm and modest, giving all the credit
to his grinning accomplice, he must have decided
in his astute mind that at last Slippery
Slim was going to have a pair of human bloodhounds
on his trail such as all his ingenuity and
vindictiveness combined could not throw into
the discard.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me have,” he went on to say to Jack, “as
good a description as possible of those same
bills your friend Scotty found in that pocketbook
dropped among his clothing by the unknown
party whom you believe was looking for
your letter of instructions from Washington.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When Jack complied with this request the
other nodded his head approvingly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question but what they were of the same
stripe as all the others that have been brought to
our attention,” he told Jack. “You must know
it’s been a mooted question as to whether the
plates from which these notes are being printed
in vast quantities (that make it a gold mine for
the gang) are counterfeits engraved by some
master in the art or stolen property, which have
somehow never been missed by the plant where
much of the printing is done for the Treasury
Department—the bills are so perfect that cashiers
and tellers are all at sea over the facts, so
that something of a near panic has resulted in
banking circles as a result of this unknown quantity.
Remember these are the old type of banknotes,
and not the new abbreviated form of currency,
so that it is more difficult to discover the
actual facts.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will all come out in the wash, sir,” remarked
Perk, sagaciously, with a sly wink at
his pal.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, Perk,” observed the gentlemanly official,
smilingly; “but I’m more concerned about
your plan of campaign than anything else right
now. During the time you stop over here in
Orleans I mean to keep you posted with regard
to any fresh news that comes in to Headquarters
for there is hardly a day when we do not learn
of additional discoveries connected with this deluge
of phony money that’s been dumped on the
whole Southwest by this hard working gang.
I am telling you everything that’s known or suspected,
so that you can figure out your best line
of action.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We understand that, Mr. Adkins,” said Jack,
nodding, “and you can rest assured we appreciate
your kindness more than I can tell you.
Before we jump off you will know what we’ve
decided to do, so as to pick up a warm trail;
and after that, sir, don’t be worried if you fail
to hear a single word from us for days, weeks,
or even months; but depend upon it we’ll be
working on the job every minute.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And never forget, I beg of you, that this
man is a devil for cruelty and craftiness—I’m
sure you’ll not delude yourselves that his arrest
will be an easy task; for as good men as were
ever on the roll of our Secret Service Department
have fallen down on the job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you again, sir, for your warning; but
we’re not meaning to feel anything like over-confidence,
so as to let the bars down. I understand
from my having been picked to take up
this case, that the knowledge of myself and my
assistant here along the line of aviation cut a big
figure in the appointment, since it has been
learned that Slim himself makes use of a flying
boat possibly to cross over from the wilds of
Mexico, it being suspected he has his plant
hidden away somewhere among the mountains,
where he doubtless keeps peace with the authorities
by paying tribute that insures his being left
undisturbed. We hope to change all that sooner
or later, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I admire your modesty, Jack,” continued the
Government official, who had warmed toward
the pair during the short time he had known
them, and seemed to take a personal interest in
their fortunes. “Remember to keep in touch
with Headquarters while in the city, so as to
notify me in case you need any assistance—I can
later on place a posse of oldtime Texas Rangers
at your service, if the occasion arises for a necessity
to show force—they are now working for
the Government as border patrols, and as you
can understand, are the same rough-riding, fearless
type that played such a leading figure in
the early history of the Lone Star State; for we
have authority that covers such matters. And
I’ll be one of the first to extend you my hearty
congratulations should you win out, and bring
in your man; as I’ve no doubt your good pal
here used to do when, as you’ve told me, he used
to work with the Canadian Mounted Police
force, in years gone by.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It won’t be our fault, sir, if we make a flop
o’ the job,” asserted Perk, who believed he ought
to get in an occasional word; although there
were a good many things he did not wholly
understand, and which he would depend on
Jack to further explain when opportunity arose.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins shook them both cordially by the
hand, and took his departure, leaving them to
digest all the startling facts he had placed in
their possession. By slow degrees they would
figure things out, and sketch their plan of operation;
then would come the hour when once more
they must depend on their wings to carry them
many hundreds of miles toward the scene of
action, where the air would be surcharged with
dynamite, while deadly enemies might be lying
in ambush, ready to take them by surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk started to spring his questions, and Jack
was only too glad to make the necessary explanations;
for it was necessary that they work in
complete harmony if they hoped to be successful.</p>

<p class='c013'>As far as they had gone, things looked hopeful
to Jack, as he marshalled the facts that had
lately been placed in their possession. He was
satisfied that when every item had been arranged
in its rightful sequence they could fashion a
plan of campaign that would at least have a
better chance for winning out than any of those
utilized by former detectives, who had not possessed
the essential wings so as to meet Slippery
Slim on his own chosen ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No tellin’ just how long we’ll stick it out in
this burgh, I guess, buddy?” suggested Perk,
some time later, as they continued to take things
easy, resting up after a hard night’s flight, and
meaning to get around the city after noon and
lunch time had come and passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Couldn’t say as yet, Perk; we’ve got to comb
out the stuff as handed over by our new friend,
Mr. Adkins, and discard everything that doesn’t
pan out as being worth while. Then there were
a few leaders he dropped that, if followed up,
might turn out to be leading clues, the possession
of which would possibly turn the tide of battle.
I’m meaning not to let anything make me show
undue speed—Rome wasn’t built in a day, we’ve
got to recollect, and so shape things from the
standpoint of ‘safety first’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! that’s the boy!” gurgled the pleased
Perk; “me, don’t I remember that story o’ the
hare an’ the tortoise runnin’ a race, which the
turtle won ’cause he never even stopped to rest
up; while the rabbit, thinkin’ he could run loops
around such a plodder, lay down to take a nap,
overslept himself, and when he got to the goal
there was Old Leatherback awaitin’ to turn the
big laugh on him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk wound up with one of his rollicking
laughs; everything seemed to create merriment
in his soul just now, after that royal breakfast;
though perhaps he was running away ahead of
the dry facts, and counting his chickens before
they were hatched out of the shell. But Perk
was confident the sly fox of a Slim would find
himself snagged in the net one of these days,
and the clever guy who handled things would
turn out to be an aviator and sky detective named
Jack Ralston.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack some time afterwards, had just aroused
from a short nap, when Perk, who had been
pondering and grumbling to himself, tossed out
another question, as if to disclose what was
troubling him:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it, old hoss, do you b’lieve them
dicks we left behind after they’d floated down
from a high ceilin’ with their chutes, got outen
the scrape, so they could a hiked to some nearby
village or town, an’ took the first train headed
for Orleans, reckonin’ we must a’been on the
jump thisaways?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say the chances all point that way, Perk,”
Jack told him, without the slightest hesitation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jumpin’ crickets! if that’s a fact why, a feller
might run acrost the slick pair any old minute—meet
’em right face to face!” Perk went on to
say, as if the fact gave him more or less concern.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose then you’d recognize the chappies
with just one look, eh, what about that, partner?”
asked Jack, laughingly; at which the other
grinned a bit foolishly, to admit he had serious
doubts on that score.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! didn’t either o’ us get a peep-in at
their monikers, worse luck—had them helmets
and goggles in place right away, like they didn’t
mean to give us a single look-in. S’pose now
they got the high sign on us boys?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“On a venture I’d say that was always possible,”
replied Jack, soberly; for this very point
had occurred to him, and was as yet unsettled
in his mind. “Nobody knows how long they may
have been in Atlanta—Mr. Adkins assured us
Slim seemed to have all sorts of strings out, so
as to learn in advance of any bunch of Government
agents taking the field against his giant
bogus money monopoly; and for all we can tell
those two may have been spying on us most
of the time we were around Candler Field, getting
our ship ready to take to the air.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rotten luck, I’m sayin’, and too much one-sided
to suit me,” growled Perk, frowning savagely.
“Here we got to do our work in the
dark; while that smart cuss holds all the high
cards in the pack, an’ c’n trump our ace any
time he takes a notion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No need to worry about that, comrade,” said
Jack, soothingly. “You must remember that
when we move along we mean to disappear as
if heading into the thickest belt of pea soup fog
ever seen—in that way they’ll lose all trace of
us, and we can play our cards as we choose, making
up for a different breed of sky travelers, so
as to dope the cleverest kind of spies he can send
out. While they’re left guessing what’s become
of us we’ll be doing our little tracking job, and
hour by hour, day after day, keep on creeping
closer to their secret stronghold, wherever that
may prove to be. Those are some of the things
we figured on doing, Perk, don’t forget.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The one addressed made no reply, but as he
let his head fall back, as if he meant to pick up
a few winks of sleep, there came a look of rapt
admiration on his weather-beaten face that bespoke
the utmost confidence in his best pal.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c014'>CHAPTER X <br /> <br />LAYING PLANS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>After a noonday lunch Jack and his partner
spent most of the afternoon in carrying out the
various duties that were seemingly on their program.
Among other things Jack visited the
Federal building, and was closeted for more
than an hour with Mr. Adkins.</p>

<p class='c013'>The latter official had conceived a great fancy
for young Ralston, and went to no end of trouble
so as to post him with regard to what he was
likely to run up against while endeavoring to
close in on Slippery Slim. With his accustomed
sagacity Jack made notes of some of the
facts thus laid before him; but since these were
in shorthand, and would be utterly unintelligible
to any outside party, should they chance
to fall into enemy hands, there was no danger
that any mischief would follow.</p>

<p class='c013'>By degrees he was filling up with scraps of
description, and everything connected with
former attempts at locating the hideout, where
all this unlawful scrip was being turned off the
press, to flood the Southwest.</p>

<p class='c013'>That was always his way of doing—when
given a tough job Jack would live alongside it,
breathing the very atmosphere of the undertaking,
until he found himself sympathetic with the
aims and ambitions of the criminals whose apprehension
was placed on his shoulders by his
Big Boss.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll have dinner early, Perk,” he told the
other, who had been carrying out a number of
special duties while Jack was busy elsewhere,
“so as to retire to our room at the hotel. No
going out after nightfall for us just at present,
especially in a strange city, where some sneak
might waylay us coming back from the theater.
All that sort of pleasure must be put out of our
heads just at present.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! guess you’re hittin’ the nail on the
head, old hoss, when you say that,” grunted
Perk, who very probably had already picked out
just the screen play he wanted so badly to see;
but he was a good scout, and able to put duty
above pleasure, when the occasion arose for
making a personal sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another thing,” continued Jack, “there’s no
telling what night flying we’re bound to be up
against, in trying to keep our movements secret;
so it’d be wise for us both to enjoy all the extra
sleep that comes our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, partner,” assented Perk, subordinating
his desires to the slogan which he knew
was Jack’s watchword—“safety first”. “When
I’ve stowed away all the grub I c’n hold mebbe
I’ll be ready to hit the hay, to stick it out till
cock-crow around daylight—an’ then some.
Pretty fair sleeper, they always called me across
the big pond—crawl out as the last horn was
blowin’, rub my eyes a bit, get aboard my fightin’
crate, an’ step off to knock another Heine pilot
down afore botherin’ ’bout my breakfast—all in a
day’s doings with Gabe Perkiser. Sabbe that,
partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I know you like a book,” Jack told him
with a smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get a bellyfull when you had that confab
with Mr. Adkins?” demanded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m filled up to the brim with all kinds of
material, which by degrees I’ll have to sort out,
keeping only what strikes me as essential,” came
the answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see—sorter separatin’ the chaff from the
wheat,” mused Perk; “an’ if it’s a fair question,
old hoss, which way do we head when we take
off?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You might call it due northeast,” Jack told
him; and then, as his companion uttered a
startled exclamation, as though vastly surprised,
Jack gave a quick glance around as if to make
certain that no one was dogging their footsteps,
after which he lowered his voice almost to a
whisper, to add: “but that would be only for a
<i>blind</i>, in case hostile eyes were watching our
departure from the flying field; for after we’ve
cleared a dozen or more miles we can make a
complete circle, and point the nose of our boat
squarely west!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good boy!” snapped the relieved Perk;
“sounds a heap more like it. You sure did
throw a big scare into me, Jack, ’cause it’d been
’bout settled ’tween us that the game had ought
to be played out there in the boundless waste
spaces around the border.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, everything points that way so far,” he
was assured; “but no more talkie at present,
Perk—we’ll keep bottled up until inside four
walls, where no spy can steal our thunder.
Slim’s knocked the underpinning away from a
bunch of fine schemes looking to his undoing,
simply by finding out what the big game happened
to be, and then bursting the bubble by a
scoop. We don’t intend to dish our business
that way if it can be helped.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wall,” drawled Perk, with his best Yankee
effect, “guess not if we know our stuff, an’ c’n
roll our hoop.”</p>

<p class='c013'>As they walked along toward their hotel Perk
kept up a constant lookout, as though endeavoring
to make some more or less thrilling discovery—never
a man, black or white, did they meet
but that he was made the object of a severe
scrutiny by the suspicious one; however, they
reached their objective without his having run
across any reason for making a decision; and
shortly afterwards they were securely lodged in
their room, the door locked, and a couple of easy
chairs inviting them to take things comfortable,
which they lost no time in doing, being wearied
from so much trotting about—flying men as a
rule not enjoying a reputation for pedestrian
feats.</p>

<p class='c013'>A long and serious confab followed, both
speaking in low tones; Jack on his part explained
the mass of information he had accumulated,
and answered the flood of questions asked
by his comrade, as well as he was able; until he
found a chance to go deeper into things himself
he could not make definite statements concerning
a number of points that were a bit hazy, and
needed confirmation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus the afternoon waned, and the time came
when they were ready to think of the essential
“eats”. Of course it was Perk who brought this
subject up, for he chanced to have a tremendous
appetite, and was apt to give considerable time
to figuring what his next <i>menu</i> would be—indeed,
half the enjoyment in his estimation lay in
thus building air castles along the line of “grub”.</p>

<p class='c013'>Remembering that little episode up in Atlanta,
where some unknown party had made such
a “rat’s nest” of Scotty’s adjoining room, evidently
under a mistaken belief it belonged to
himself and Perk, Jack made sure to carry all
his important papers on his person, properly secured,
so that no deft hand of a sneak thief could
negotiate their abstraction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All ready, partner,” he told Perk, at the time
looking out of the window, holding back the
curtains to see the better who chanced to be
walking along the opposite pavement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never said sweeter words than them, old
boy; I sure was close to faintin’, my tummy
feelin’ like the bottom was adroppin’ out—soup
an’ such soft stuffs, while fillin’ at the time don’t
stay with me any great while—I crave solids
mostly. On your way then, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had marshalled all the facts that had
been placed in his possession, weeded a few out
as worthless, and by the time their discussion
ended had told his companion that the Finger
of Destiny was pointing out their future course
as lying over the almost boundless plains of
Texas, across New Mexico, and deep into Arizona
deserts, to the wild country along the border
not far distant from the spot at which the
Gila river forms a junction with the larger Colorado;
where the latter serves as a watery boundary
line between Arizona and Southeastern California,
with Old Mexico less than thirty miles
distant as the crow flies.</p>

<p class='c013'>It would be a big jump for them, but the flood
of bad currency undoubtedly had its start somewhere
in this hostile region, and spread out like
an open fan, northwest into San Diego and Los
Angeles—northward up to Salt Lake City—and
in the northeast as far as Oklahoma. To
effectually break it up it was necessary that they
go to the fountain head, so as to destroy the very
roots of the noisome poison ivy plant.</p>

<p class='c013'>They spent more than half an hour dining,
and needless to say Perk enjoyed himself to his
heart’s content—who wouldn’t if he had a pocketfull
of ready cash, furnished by a bountiful
Uncle Sam; a bill of fare bristling with all kinds
of tempting dishes such as Perk doted on; and
to complete the combination having been born
with a healthy, unbridled appetite?</p>

<p class='c013'>It was just commencing to get dusk when they
emerged from the restaurant and started back to
the hotel, some two blocks distant. Perk, as
usual, kept turning his head this way and that
very much like a wolf scalp-hunter looking for
his suspicious quarry. Presently he picked at
Jack’s sleeve, and bending his head until his lips
almost touched the other’s ear he observed in a
sibilant whisper!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen, partner—we got a clam doggin’ us
like a bloodhound on the track o’ a runaway nigger
from a convict camp back in Alabam—get
that, do you?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c014'>CHAPTER XI <br /> <br />THE NIGHT ALARM</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“I’m not thrilled by what you say, Perk, because
I’ve been more than half expecting to hear
that discovery. Glad you got on to him okay;
because it’s always best to know what’s in the
wind. What sort of a chap is he like?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack spoke in his usual calm way, and the other
realized he had undoubtedly been prepared for
the sudden news.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ out o’ the way ’bout his looks, far as
I c’n see,” was Perk’s reply; “on’y got a few
squints at the guy; but he’s keepin’ tab o’ our
movements I guess now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Reckon he might be one of those lads in the
Ryan ship that crashed in flames after they’d
flown the coop?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! just can’t be dead sure, partner,”
chuckled Perk; “but there’s somethin’ ’bout his
walk that gets me into believin’ he’s the <i>kiwi</i>
that pilot was keepin’ on our tail so long, stickin’
like a leech from a mud-hole.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder,” the other went on to say, as if
talking to himself; “if that’s the case then, both
those duffers pulled through with their lives, and
not so badly hurt. Honestly I’m a bit glad that’s
so, for up to the present I’ve never had occasion
to take a human life.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk snorted on hearing this.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if so be you’d been ten years older, my
boy, mebbe you’d not be able to say that—chances
are you’d a been mixed up in that mess across the
Atlantic, when Yanks an’ Johnny Rebs were
fightin’ shoulder to shoulder, and it was a case o’
a Heine pilot’s life or our’n. But if you keep
on with Uncle Sam’s service as you’re adoin’
right now, the time’ll come for you to fetch back
a dead man who jest <i>wouldn’t</i> let hisself be captured.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like as not,” remarked Jack; “but there’s no
need of crossing a river till you come to it; so
I’m not taking trouble by the forelock away
ahead of time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’ll we do ’bout this dickey bird that’s
bobbin’ at our heels so gaily, tell me, partner?”
pursued Perk, eagerly, as though in his fighting
heart he was actually hoping his superior would
give the order to turn on their persistent pursuer,
and at least blacken both his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! nothing at all, Perk; let him run his
rope; only we’ll keep along streets where there’s
plenty of company, and be prepared for any sort
of ambush; though I can’t believe he’d be crazy
enough to start anything so early in the evening—if
the hour was close to midnight, things
might be different. There are any number of
tough cases in this old Creole city ready to handle
a sticking game for the coin in it—blacks and
yellows and whites it doesn’t matter which—all
of them are assassins at heart.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then you don’t care if he shadows us straight
to the hotel?” demanded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Much good that will do him.” said Jack with
a light laugh; “the chances are two to one he
already knows where we’ve put up, and has had
some spy dog me to the Federal building. When
the time comes for us to jump off we’ll find a
slick way to hop our ship without giving these
boys a show-down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently they arrived at the hotel entrance,
without any untoward incident arising to mar
the quiet of the evening. Perk cast a parting
glance toward their rear just before entering,
and seeing the shadowy figure hovering not far
away, considered it a part of his duty to place
his thumb to his nose, and wiggle his fingers
derisively, at the same time uttering a snarl like
a bobcat at bay, to express his utter contempt.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once in their room, Jack first of all cast about
as if to decide whether any uninvited guest had
intruded on their preserves while they were absent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything seems to be just as we left it,”
he told his running mate, after making this little
survey, “and even if some busybody did get in
here with the aid of a pass-key borrowed from a
chambermaid, he was shrewd enough not to mess
things up like they did with our friend Scotty
of the air mail bunch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess now they must acome to the conclusion
you keep the letter o’ instructions ’bout your
person,” suggested Perk, wisely, “which, bein’
the case mebbe now they figger on sneakin’ in
here while we’re sound asleep, an’ agoin’ through
your clothes in regulation style. They do tell me
there be sneak thieves right clever in this same
burgh, equal to the ones out in India, where they
c’n steal the sheet from under a sleeper, without
wakin’ him up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I understand that’s really true, partner,” Jack
agreed; “but we’re not going to let them have
half a chance, even if they hired all the crooks
in New Orleans to play the game.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sounds good to me, boss,” Perk declared.
“We’ll manage to sleep with one eye open, an’
if any critter tries to give us the once over, he’ll
wish he’d never been born, that’s all I know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Before turning in, Jack placed a chair so nicely
balanced that in case of the door being ever so
slightly opened it would crash to the floor, making
enough noise to arouse the Seven Sleepers.
Perk grinned at seeing him prepare this “guardian
angel” as he termed it, and lost no time himself
in “hitting the hay.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Some time later in the night, when outside
noises had almost died away, there came a loud
clatter that awoke both the sleepers instantly.
They bounced out on the floor in their pajamas,
with Jack pulling the cord he had attached to
the electric bulb, so that the room was magically
illuminated.</p>

<p class='c013'>The chair lay on its side, and just beyond Perk
could see that their door was partly open; the
key had been left in the lock, but skillful fingers
must have manipulated it by means of
slender-jawed pliers, showing the touch of a professional
thief.</p>

<p class='c013'>Straight toward the door the form of Perk was
projected—a hungry lion could hardly have
made a more pronounced leap at some four-legged
game which he had been stalking.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tearing open the door still wider, Perk thrust
out his head, and looked up and down the hotel
corridor. He fancied he could make out a dim
figure far along the poorly lighted hall, but it
vanished like a phantom even as he stared, evidently
turning some corner.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there were other sounds arising—doors
all along the corridor were opening, and heads
being projected, showing how the startling alarm
had awakened numerous other sleepers, who
may have imagined an earthquake was in process
of occurring, though such a happening was utterly
foreign to the metropolis on the Lower Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c013'>Voices, too, were heard, from both masculine
as well as feminine sources, as the aroused hotel
guests endeavored to fathom the real meaning
of the row.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, seeing there was nothing doing, closed
the door, and locked it again; after which he
turned to his companion who had been watching
his actions with more or less amusement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Consarn his picture,” growled the old fighter;
“he got off scot free; I jest glimpsed him
aturnin’ the first bend down the hall. Blamed
shame I couldn’t come to grips with the yeller
cub—I’d a given a heap to twist his neck
some, you bet I would. Mebbe now I’d otter sit
up the rest o’ the night to make certain, eh,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not the slightest need of such a thing, partner,”
Jack assured him. “I’ll fix that door so it
won’t be opened again in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c013'>With that he again took the stout chair, and
placed it diagonally against the door, so that its
top rested just under the knob; after that had
been accomplished it must needs be a battering-ram
that could burst in on them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not content with that, Jack went to each of
the two windows, thrust out his head to examine
for the second time the face of the outer wall of
the building so as to make sure there was no
ledge wide enough to give a would-be trespasser
foothold.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not the ghost of a chance for the most nimble
thief to get in by way of a window, Perk, so
back to bed we go, and sleep like babes in the
wood for we’re in the third story and far enough
from a fire escape to be secure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk grinned and nodded acquiescence; truth
to tell he was not at all averse to starting all over
again—possibly the rude interruption had disturbed
him just when he was starting to partake
of a royal feast that covered every one of his most
beloved dishes and he was hugging the delusion
to his heart that if given another chance history
might repeat itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>At least there was no further alarm, and the
night passed into oblivion like all its countless
predecessors with the rising sun arousing the
two comrades, and Perk as usual singing out
that he felt as though he could easily manage two
customary breakfasts in that delighful restaurant
where they were already feeling so much at
home.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c014'>CHAPTER XII <br /> <br />PLAYING WITH FIRE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>During the morning Jack took a taxi and paid
another visit to the offices in the government
building where Mr. Adkins had his desk, doing
his daily stunt under the direction of the U. S.
District Attorney and other officials in the service
of Uncle Sam.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, also, had his job laid out for him, which
was to circulate around until he felt positive he
had thrown off any possible spy after which it
was his duty to make certain purchases, following
the list Jack had given him, have them all
sent to the aviation field in charge of the man
Mr. Adkins had placed on guard at the hangar
containing their ship and thus completing the
stock of supplies necessary for their long flight
and survey work.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk carried out his instructions to the letter,
and with great vim, since the fact of their laying
in these stores was a positive indication that
things were coming to pass insuring a speedy
getaway and <i>Action</i> was what had come to be
the greatest asset in life to Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>They met again at noon in their eating place,
where, choosing an isolated corner table they
could discuss their plan of campaign, even while
attending to the wants of the inner man.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk made his report, which the other seemed
to find good, judging from his frequent nods of
acquiescence and when the story had been told
to the last word, Perk felt it was his turn to
learn things.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess now you got the last batch o’ information
from His Nibs, Jack?” he hastened to
ask, expectantly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sure did, partner,” he was told. “A few
scraps of fresh news that’d be likely to interest
us had drifted in since I saw Mr. Adkins last,
which he passed along to me. I’ll sort these
shreds over later, and fix them where they belong.
So far as I can see now they corroborate
what we’ve already been so strongly believing
must be a fact.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which means, I guess, boss, we head west?”
ventured Perk, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Into the setting sun—that’s right, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do we still expect to keep in touch with Mr.
Adkins, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whenever the chance opens up, and we have
any important news to send along or want to
know certain things, perhaps even to call on him
for that bunch of old-time Texas Rangers he
said he could turn over to us if we found any
use for them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be!” said Perk, plainly excited, “I
sure do hope that emergency does bob up, ’cause
I’d give my last Mex dollar to glimpse them
rearin’, tearin’ ole fighters knockin’ spots outen
the bunch o ’lawless ringers Slippery Slim’s
gathered around him. Chances are they’d skip
out like hot fleas soon as they heard the ol’time
battle cry o’ the defenders o’ the Rio Grande in
the days when cattle rustlers raided the ranches
down Texas way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But we’ve got to remember,” cautioned
Jack, “that these chaps are like lean hungry
wolves, that never leave the trail of a wounded
stag as long as they can crawl along. I’m not
fancying we’ve pulled the wool over their eyes
so far and that fact was brought to my attention
just after I got back from conferring with
Mr. Adkins.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As how, boss?” queried the curious Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t just know what influenced me after
I’d entered the hotel, to step back and look out
again,” explained Jack. “There was the driver
of my taxi, the trusty who’d been recommended
by the clerk at the desk, talking earnestly with
an unknown party and even as I watched I saw
him thrust a bank note into the chauffeur’s itching
hand, showing that he has been corrupted
and is in cohoot with our enemies.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! is it so rotten bad as all that, partner?”
bleated the disgusted Perk, “All I c’n
say is I sure do hope it was a nice brand new five-dollar
bill he handed over to the yeller dog, an’
that it’s agoin’ to turn out to be a sample o’ their
bogus money outfit. Serve the slick renegade if
he got hisself pulled in for passin’ a counterfeit
note on some guy that ain’t goin’ to sit by and
take what’s comin’ to him without raisin’ a nice
howl.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t be too vindictive, Perk,” Jack told
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, partner, ever see the boob afore?” the
other demanded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you mean the chap who was pumping my
driver for all that was out, Perk, I can’t say
that I have. He was a flashily dressed man,
with loud clothes that would stamp him as a
gambler, like those who used to travel on these
Mississippi River steamboats in the old days before
the Civil War, fleecing unsuspecting passengers
out of all their money and I haven’t
the least doubt but what he’s a member of the
very gang we’re expecting to round up. Mr.
Adkins told me it was simply amazing the vastness
of the combine Slippery Slim’s managed to
gather around him but he was certain it must
number many scores of workers, all obeying the
orders of the mainspring—crooked Slim Garrabrant.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! the more you keep on tellin’ me them
big stories, Jack, the happier it all makes me
’cause I seem to just know there’s bound to be a
heap o’ rough house stuff croppin’ up, to cool
my blood, ragin’ hot just now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some fine day you’ll be rubbing up against
enough fighting to make you call quits with the
game. Perk, my boy; and it’s just likely to crop
up before long if indications count for anything.
I felt pretty sure from his swagger that
this fellow might be the very same master mind
in charge of that Ryan boat—then, too, when he
walked away he had a little limp, which might
have come from striking the ground so hard
after his chute let him down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Darned pity he didn’t break a leg, or even
his measly ol’ neck, I’d say,” grumbled Perk, one
of his fits of resentment gripping him just then.
“Got no use for these treacherous snakes that
squirm, and worm their way into the confidence
o’ honest gents, on’y to play a low-down trick,
an’ fill their pockets with smackers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s one thing we’ve got to guard
against,” suggested Jack, who seemed to have a
faculty for looking at every side of a picture,
and anticipating troubles that might never have
occurred to others less gifted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As what, partner?” asked Perk, brightening
up once more.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Delay is what they may be hoping for—some
way to hold us here while important news is
carried to headquarters. I can even see how
they might make some sort of ridiculous charge
against us to the police, in hopes we would be
held several days under suspicion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk looked astonished.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But see here, boss, we got our credentials
from Washington to prove we’re in the Secret
Service, an’ sky detectives at that; they jest
wouldn’t dare hold us on some sorter flimsy
charge ’cause that’d get ’em in hard with the
Government, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never know how these affairs may turn
out,” said Jack. “Often there seems to be some
kind of a jealous feeling between States officers
and those of the Government—almost like a little
vendetta, each arm of the Law striking out
at the other, and getting in a sly lick that’s good
for a laugh after hostilities have died down.
These Southern city police might make out
there was a grave charge of abduction or something
like that, compelling them to hold us <i>incommunicado</i>—that
is keep us from intercourse
with the U. S. District Attorney’s office until
several days had elapsed and then setting us
free with a lot of apologies that didn’t mean anything
whatsoever.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! I get your drift partner,” said Perk,
frowning. “We sure can’t afford to spend any
of our valuable time in the hoosgow here, if we
c’n help it. ’Cause things set that way I hope
you get busy an’ fix it so we’ll shake the dust o’
this same burgh off our shoes in a hurry. Got
the date settled yet, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shook hands with, and said goodbye to Mr.
Adkins this morning, Perk and you are at
liberty to figure that out as you please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it’s <i>tonight</i>?” asked the other, looking
well satisfied with such an enticing programme.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wind and weather permitting we’ll clear out
soon after twilight settles down on the city and
the river,” Jack assured his understudy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me, I’m sittin’ pretty, an’ taking things as
they come along, old hoss,” continued Perk.
“Let’s perambulate and attend to the crying
needs of this high noon hour—the girl told me
they expected to have apple dumplings for lunch
today an’ that’s one I’d nominate as bein’ among
my prime favorites—you know I got a <i>few</i> I
really enjoy an’ that’s no lie either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I know a good many on your list—fact
is,” said frank Jack, “if I ran down the whole
menu this noon there’d be only a scant few that’s
missed being called your especial favorites each
in its turn as the wind blew. But just as well
we did all the eating while the chance lasts, for
only a magician can tell what our bill of fare is
going to be during the coming week or two—some
weird dishes most likely—boiled owl,
fried rattlesnake, baked prairie dog—Heaven
knows to what ends we may be reduced.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have a heart, partner, don’t take my healthy
appetite away by mentionin’ them terrible
dishes. ’Member you promised we’d hire a taxi
after lunch, an’ drive all around the city, lampin’
the big sights like the French market, the queer
buryin’ places where holes in thick walls take
the place o’ graves, on ’count o’ there bein’ so
much water in the ground, with the city settin’
so low down, an’ the ol’ Mississippi on one o’
its benders. Then I want to eat Gulf oysters
an’ shrimp at one o’ them cute little stands we
noticed yesterday afternoon; try a reg’lar Creole
dinner tonight at that place Mr. Adkins told us
about—after which I’m all done with Orleans,
an’ ready to pull up stakes for keeps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll keep that to the last, Perk, and go to
the flying field from the eating house by taxi.
From that time on we’ll have to depend on our
own heads and hands to keep us out of difficulties.
But let’s hope we can climb up to a three
thousand foot ceiling, and strike out as if we
were aiming for Savannah or Jacksonville, only
to swing around inside of half an hour, climb
high over the city and river and put for the
Texas border at full speed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This enchanting program gave Perk much
cause for rejoicing and he sat down at their regular
table in the restaurant feeling, as he expressed
it, “happy as a clam at high tide” and
full of little laughs that seemed to gurgle up
from his shoes.</p>

<p class='c013'>They chatted of other happenings, not wishing
to “talk shop” in such a crowded place, lest
listening ears pick up certain information that
could be used greatly to their disadvantage—Perk
had an endless fund of interesting reminiscences
that, told in his inimitable fashion,
were a never failing source of joy to the appreciative
air pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was spent in motoring all
around the most interesting portions of the city,
the obliging Mr. Adkins having made out a list
of subjects they should not miss seeing while on
this first visit to the justly famous Louisiana metropolis.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIII <br /> <br />THE HOP-OFF</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Leaving the hotel, after settling their account,
and still making use of the taxi with its accommodating
driver, Jack and his comrade had
taken what small amount of hand luggage they
possessed along with them, not meaning to come
back again.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins had recommended a small but
unique restaurant run by a buxom French madame,
where they could have a Creole supper,
such as would long haunt their memories as a
genuine treat and it was to this place they ordered
their driver to convey them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both of them felt fairly convinced they had
been shadowed during the afternoon, although
so carefully must this have been accomplished
they had no positive proof to make it what Perk
would term a “dead certainty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They really did have a delightful “feed,” and
the dishes set before them were as a rule complete
mysteries although the obliging madame,
seeing they were tasting her triumphs of the
French <i>chef’s</i> art for the first time, gladly explained
the nature of the food they consumed
with so much gusto.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was fascinated with his supper, and inwardly
vowed that this should not be the last time
he would partake of tasty Creole dishes. This
duty fulfilled, they faced the next progressive
step in their night’s program—making for
the aviation field, and boarding their ship for
a speedy takeoff, their ultimate goal neither of
them could say just where, save that if all went
well they expected to be somewhere along the
California border within the next few days.</p>

<p class='c013'>The taxi was waiting, with the chauffeur on
the alert. He had already been advised of the
fact that they anticipated having some parties
attempt to spy upon them as evening settled
down and on this account he had maintained a
strict watch for troublesome visitors who might
even attempt to threaten him with bodily injury
unless he agreed to enter into their plans for
delaying the flight of the two flyers, as he knew
his passengers to be from what he had been told.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I see our taxi’s still on deck, partner,”
observed Perk, just as if he might have suspected
they would find it missing, with a detail of grim
city police waiting to escort them to the lockup,
they to be held in durance vile until serious
charges against them could be sifted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing came along to bother you, Henri?”
asked Jack of the smiling driver, who laughed
as he said in reply:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I haf seen one beeg hulk of ze man hanging
around, M’sieu, and looking as if he would like
to eat me up but me, I haf been an old soldier
in the Grand Army of France, and I think he did
not like the way I throw my chest out thees way,
and walk as eef I am on guard duty; he did not
address a single word to me, but just a little
while ago he disappear—I think he may haf
gone to get more courage out of ze glass.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good boy, Henri,” said the grinning Perk,
clapping a hand on the stalwart chauffeur’s
shoulder; “for myself I should not like to tackle
you when you have your fighting face all set.
Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So they were off, and heading out in the direction
of the aviation grounds, with the first shadows
of approaching evening gathering around
them. Perk may have been more or less nervous,
in anticipation of something coming to pass that
would seriously cripple their plans for a speedy
flight, since he kept turning his head from side
to side and scrutinizing every one they saw upon
the streets they traversed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Henri maintained a fairly good speed, all the
law would permit, so that few cars passed them
on the road. Perk managed to watch closely,
and never a motor came booming along in their
wake, honking to announce the driver’s intention
to pass by, than he had his eyes glued on the car
and continued to pay strict attention until it
had crept well up ahead.</p>

<p class='c013'>But after all nothing out of the way came to
pass, and eventually they reached the aviation
field where they found lights already in play,
since a delayed air mail ship was hovering over
signaling for better illumination. There was
some small damage in regard to the steering
gear, making it a bit risky to try a landing unless
the field was brilliantly lighted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You made an arrangement with a couple of
the ground force to hang around so as to help
us get the crate out okay, didn’t you, Perk?”
queried Jack, as they drew up close to the particular
hangar where they had seen their plane
placed in quarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, I sure did, Jack,” the other replied.
“Must be they’re over where that crate hanging
overhead means to land—somethin’ wrong mebbe
but they gimme their word to stay around
till we got here—there, I c’n lamp the guys
runnin’ thisaways right now, so it’s okay, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I see them coming,” returned the other,
himself a bit relieved, since the intended departure
was a most important episode in their plans,
and to meet with any sort of a setback would
be most aggravating indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The two mechanicians quickly arrived, the
hanger was unlocked and opened so as to permit
the exit of the ship. First of all both flyers
hastened to don their working togs, then fasten
on the ’chutes with the harness necessary for the
purpose, all working smoothly and finally clapping
their helmets on their heads, with the earflaps
secured to keep things in readiness for any
emergency that might crop up.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being accomplished, Jack gave the word
to have the heavy ship dragged out into the open.
He knew that his assistant would have looked
after everything essential to their comfort during
the coming flight for Perk was one of those
dependable fellows who carry out orders with
machine-like regularity.</p>

<p class='c013'>A few parties had hastened up to see what
was going on but so far as Perk could tell they
were either workers connected with the field, or
else visitors from the city, who had lingered to
watch the landing of the air mail, so as to tell
how it was done when they reached their several
homes, to partake of a late supper.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now the ship had been swung around so as
to head into the west, since the soft evening breeze
was coming from that quarter and everything
seemed in readiness for the take-off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, still surveying his surroundings as if
still cherishing a fragment of his former suspicions
that all might not be as lovely as surface
indications would announce, started to climb
aboard. Jack on his part was handing some
money to the two men, not wishing to leave a
single thing unpaid when passing out from New
Orleans—there was nothing to be done about
their use of the hangar, since Mr. Adkins had
assured him that matter had already been taken
care of, regardless of how long they chose to
linger in the Crescent City.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, too, cast a last glance around, just as he
would have done had he still been with the air
mail service and about to start off on his customary
night flight with the north-bound sacks
of letters and the express matter that vent along.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then he heard Perk give vent to a hurried
exclamation:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get aboard, partner; I guess the measly critters
are acomin’ down on us like hot cakes right
now. Lookit how they start arunnin’ thisaway,
will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did not bother looking, as every second
might be valuable; he climbed aboard with alacrity,
and settled down in his seat; at the same time
calling out to the helpers to stand aside. Then
he pulled the gun, with the motor responding
instantly, so well had Perk done his work when
checking up the ship that morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was still glueing his eyes on the several
figures now racing madly in their general direction,
and waving their arms wildly; no doubt
they had started to shout in addition, but the
descending air mail crate was making more or
less racket, which, added to by their own motor’s
thunder, prevented any one from hearing what
they may have been whooping.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was trembling with an excess of emotion—evidently
they had just escaped “by the
skin of their teeth,” for he felt certain he could
distinguish the uniforms of the police in the
little bunch of runners.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Played your hand just a mite too late, gents!”
Perk was whooping as he in turn waved a mocking
adieu backward; “thought you’d ketch a
weasel asleep, I guess, but not so easy, you gate
crashers. Wow! here we go spinnin’ along like
the wind, and it’s goodnight to the bunch. Huh!
shootin’ at us, air you—jest awastin’ ammunition,
that’s all, boys. Go ’way back an’ sit down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Jack lifted her in an upward fling, and
they were off like a startled hawk!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIV <br /> <br />SKIRTING THE GULF</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There was some shooting going on back there,
for although of course the watchful Perk failed
to catch the sound of discharges of guns, he did
see flash after flash, proclaiming that the police,
under the impression that important criminals
were beating them to it, wished to show
their warlike spirit by such a bombardment.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the flying missiles came anywhere near the
ascending plane that fact was not manifest to the
two occupants of the cockpit; their movements
must have been too speedy for such an attack to
be successful and almost immediately they had
risen beyond the danger line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was feeling vastly relieved, for it would
have been a bad beginning of their special mission
were they detained for days in the Southern
city, while the agents of the great counterfeit
league held the upper hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>He could see with the last glimpse he had of
the aviation field that all this lively accompaniment
to their take-off had created considerable
excitement—people were running back and
forth, like milling cattle when stampeded in a
furious thunder storm and Perk even fancied
there was some sort of a movement as though a
ship would be sent after them in pursuit.</p>

<p class='c013'>That troubled him not a bit, because already
they were leaving the field far in their wake, and
would really be lost in the gathering shadows of
coming night before any pursuit plane left the
ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides, had they not already had one experience
along those lines, and completely worsted
the persistent enemy, sending their boat down in
spirals of flames, with the two occupants forced
to “bail out” in order to save their lives?</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk put that possibility completely out of
his mind and busied himself with more practical
affairs. First of all he was desirous of communicating
with his comrade and to do this
they must have those indispensible head-phones
clapped to their ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was already applying his own pair with a
confidence inspired by frequent applications,
after which he managed to get Jack equipped
with the other pair.</p>

<p class='c013'>Steadily they continued to ascend, and swing
around until they faced the east, following the
plan Jack had outlined to his mate. Not too
high did the pilot urge his craft, since such a
course was apt to bring them in the sunlight
that still lingered along the upper air lanes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, they turned out to be a hot bunch all
right, partner,” was what Perk observed, when
he had the harness adjusted and the ear-phone
means of communication in shape for use.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You reckon they must have fetched the police
out with them, do you, Perk?” demanded the
one at the stick, as he kept an eye on his dials
spread across the black dashboard in front of the
cockpit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! just what they did, old hoss,” returned
the other, vehemently, but accompanying his remark
with a loud chuckle that told of secret
amusement, he being excessively fond of anything
that smacked of a joke; “an’ they kept up
a runnin’ fire at us, let me tell you—could see the
flashes spittin’ like fire crackers on the Fourth
o’ July.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All of which sounds like they must have told
a pretty wild and woolly yarn to the cops, to
make them want us as bad as that, eh, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Makes me think they got an idea this ain’t
goin’ to be just a ordinary man-hunt, but something
worth while; we should worry, Jack.
Mebbe they a’ready see the handwritin’ on the
wall, an’ mean to try an’ upset us in the start,
’fore we get agoin’ full tilt. Notice you’ve gone
an’ headed east, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It may fool them; but whether it does or not,
Perk, such a move’s our proper caper. When
we’ve gone something like ten or fifteen miles
we’ll get on the curve, swing around to the south,
and then when in sight of the gulf turn due west;
after that we’ll be on our way to the place where
our work is waiting for us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! had an idea you’d just climb till out
o’ sight, an’ then cross over the city and river—how
’bout it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too much risk to begin with,” came the ready
reply, showing how Jack always planned ahead;
“you know how a rushing boat can be heard
clearly even when lost to sight among the clouds.
It might be those same smart chaps, backed by
the authority of the police, would commandeer
a ship, and cruise around over the city, so as to
learn if we <i>did</i> come back so as to line out into
the heart of Texas; to make sure such a giveaway
of our plans can’t upset our calculations
we’ll cross the delta of the Mississippi close to
where it joins its muddy waters with the gulf.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you now, partner, an’ let me say I guess
that’s the safest game we c’n play. Time don’t
count anything wuth while with us on this trip
but results are what we crave.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it that time, boy, the Big Boss has
confidence in our being able to fetch home the
bacon, and we’re bound to prove he didn’t make
any mistake in putting us on the job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>All this time they continued to zoom along
like a frightened wild duck, and it was not long
before Jack was turning the nose of his ship
toward the south. The night had not as yet
settled down over the earth, although they were
holding an altitude of several thousand feet and
by straining his eyes a bit Perk was able to distinguish
objects far below—he could tell when
they passed over a large sheet of water, probably
Lake Ponchartrain, with narrower cuts winding
through vast marshes, and seas of waving reeds;
also begin to catch fugitive glimpses of the still
distant Mexican Gulf stretching away to the
mysterious south.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was all deeply interesting to Perk, always
on the lookout for fresh and novel scenes; for as
it happened, thus far in all his wanderings he
had really never looked upon that historical sheet
of salt water; although reading many a rattling
romance of the days when buccaneers and pirates
haunted the sub-tropical waters of that same
gulf, lying in wait for the Spanish galleons laden
with gold bars taken from the prodigally rich
mines of Mexico and Central America.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Perk’s mind those historical personages,
like Blackbeard, and his fellow rovers of the
Black Flag, lent a glamour to the great body of
water that was apt to thrill him through and
through whenever he allowed his gaze to fall
upon its restless surface, and dark secrets of the
past ages.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards their course was again
altered, with the ship swinging into the west. It
would seem to have been something like extreme
caution on Jack’s part but from all accounts, as
well as from their own experience with the desperate
gang that had given Uncle Sam so much
trouble, the scoundrels had a tremendous game
at stage, and were ready to go to any lengths to
protect the profitable conspiracy from being
smashed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Safety before speed” had always been Jack’s
slogan, which could be accounted one of the leading
reasons for the success that had come to him
in the various vocations he had followed—as a
county fair barn-stormer, then in the regular air
mail service, and now finally with the celebrated
Secret Service arm of the Government, entrusted
with one of the most abnormal duties ever given
out to its members.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not too dark for Perk to know when they
were passing over the several outlets to the
mighty river; indeed, he was even able to distinguish
an ocean going steamship heading up
toward the city of New Orleans; for its lights
were plainly in evidence and those who chanced
to be on deck could probably catch the throb of
their motor, since the air was unusually still,
allowing sounds to be heard at great distances,
especially when in the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then finally they left the water behind, and
found themselves passing over great stretches of
sugarcane, and bamboo thickets, with cabins of
the humble blacks in little hamlets, sometimes
villages of the lowlands, where, as Perk plainly
recollected, recent terrible floods had wrought
such damage.</p>

<p class='c013'>So the night wore on, and thus far nothing
had occurred to cause them the slightest worry.
If their cunning enemies suspected them of
planning to go west, and baiting the chief in his
lair, there was nothing as yet to show that they
were making arrangements to intercept the air
adventurers on their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>An hour—two of them passed, and still they
kept making rapid progress. The moon was long
above the eastern horizon, although occasionally
obscured by passing clouds but Perk told himself
it was a pretty fair night, all things considered,
and that he had “no kick coming.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c014'>CHAPTER XV <br /> <br />PERK AS A FIRE-FIGHTER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was not far from midnight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had insisted on taking over the controls,
so that Jack might secure a little rest, possibly
even pick up a few catnaps in addition. They
were at a low altitude, perhaps not more than a
thousand feet up, since the air was a bit cool
higher and it was certain they stood in no
danger from colliding with mountain peaks
while crossing the wide State of Texas, where
nothing save the level plains lay beneath.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was alive to his duties, but this did not
keep him from occasionally stretching his neck,
so as to look over the coaming of the cockpit,
and trying to make out objects that might be
dimly detected on the seemingly limitless plain
below.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a rule next to nothing worth while rewarded
these efforts and really he continued
doing his little stunt from sheer habit, but there
did come a time when he showed sudden interest,
and even half arose from his seat to stare
with increasing intensity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not only that but he immediately banked, to
start circling around a certain point. A minute
afterwards Perk reached out and shook Jack
gently by the shoulder. The ear-phones being
still affixed to their heads, Jack naturally desired
to know what was up, and did his pal wish to
give over the stick to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ doing, partner,” he was told with
emphasis; “but there’s somethin’ queer goin’ on
down yonder, and I’ve swung around so’s to give
it the once over. On your right, Jack, an’ there,
see how it sparks up again, will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say it looks like a fire,” ventured Jack,
after taking a good look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My idea to a fraction, boss!” snapped the
deeply interested Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like it might be breaking out through
the roof of some sort of cabin, or ranch house,”
further suggested Jack, himself now almost as
excited as his running mate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, boy!” declared Perk; “but somehow
I don’t lamp anybody kickin’ around in a
big fuss, ’cause o’ the shack bein’ ablaze; strikes
me either nobody ain’t to home or else they’re
so sound asleep they don’t know what’s goin’ on.
Glory be! if that’s the case, partner, they stand
a mighty good chance o’ bein’ burnt to death in
their beds. What ought we do ’bout it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“First place we’ve just got to rouse ’em up,
and the way to do that is to rush our engine to the
limit, so’s to make a big row—if that doesn’t
wake anybody it’ll only mean they’re away from
home—or else already smothered by the smoke.”
Perk accordingly started up such a racket that
the dreadful roaring noise seemed hoarse enough
to awaken the dead and all the while he kept
swinging around in a continuous circle.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, bending over the side, watched to see if
this had any effect, nor was his discovery long
delayed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That fetched them, Perk—I can see several
moving figures, and they seem to be rushing about
with pails in their hands. If the fire hasn’t got
too strong a start they may be able to throw
enough water to put it out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, couldn’t we do somethin’ more to help
the poor dicks?” cried Perk, ever ready and
willing to assist anybody in trouble, no matter
at what cost or personal risk to himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It mightn’t be a safe thing to attempt a blind
landing,” he was told; but something in Jack’s
voice or manner when he said this encouraged
Perk to go a bit further.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, chances are it’s as level as a barn floor
down there,” he hastened to say, eagerly; “here,
you could take the stick—there never was a better
hand at makin’ a three-point landin’ than
you, partner; me, I might drop a few flares down,
an’ that’d give us a squint o’ the ground. If we
kept to leeward o’ the fire there wouldn’t be any
risk from sparks, don’t you see, Jack? I never
yet had such a fat chance to be a fire-fighter;
let’s go, boy—they need all the help they c’n
get, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The temptation was so great it soon overpowered
Jack’s sense of caution; really he fancied
he would never forgive himself if he allowed
Perk to show a higher sense of duty to people
in distress than he himself could display.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, you win, Perk!” he quickly called
out; “hand over the stick, and get those flares
ready to drop when I give the word.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk started to make a move, showing that he
knew just where the objects of his desire were
located, for he did not have to leave his seat in
order to place his hand upon the small package
of flares.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile Jack had reduced their speed to
a minimum compatible with safety, still continuing
that circular movement. The fire had
by this time assumed sufficient proportions to
dispel any doubts they may have entertained regarding
its true nature, for it was burning at a
lively rate. Jack could see a crouching figure
sprawled on the roof, and apparently emptying
bucket after bucket of water on the greedy flames,
and passing the empties back down the nearby
ladder to some one standing on an upper rung.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was all mighty exciting, and to Jack seemed
like some sort of fetching picture as shown on
the silver screen at the movies—a scene developed
through the skill of a wizard director, aided
by a group of star actors, so as to bring out all
the realistic effects.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get ready, Perk!” he told the other suddenly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All set, partner,” came the inspiring response.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let her go, then!” called out the pilot, just
as he found himself over a point to leeward of the
burning ranch house that he figured would be
the best place to make a landing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had a flare falling almost as the last
words left the lips of the pilot and then both
of them used their eyes to advantage as it neared
the ground, lighting up a small section fairly
well—at least what he thus saw seemed to convince
Jack it would be fairly safe to attempt a
landing, for the ground looked smooth, and free
from outbuildings, corrals, or wire fences.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Drop another, quick as you can!” directed
Jack; then, as this was carried out he started
down, showing the die was cast, come what
would.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk threw a third flare to one side, in the
hope that its light would afford his pilot a chance
to effect one of his really marvelous landings;
which turned out to be sound reasoning on his
part—the shock when their landing gear came in
contact with the ground was not very severe, and
Jack managed so that they did not run more than
thirty feet toward the burning house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus far all was well.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was out of the cockpit like a flash, but
managed to hold his eager spirit in check long
enough to allow his comrade to join him. Then
they hurried over to the building, which they
could now see, thanks to both the moonlight and
the brilliance of the blaze, must be some kind of
a ranch house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Several men who had the appearance of cow
punchers were working for all they were worth,
fetching water from a well, and hurling it where
it was calculated to do the most good.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s give you a hand in that game, neighbors!”
Jack burst out with, as he joined the string,
backed by Perk, and commenced handling
buckets full and buckets empty, with as much
vim as though tested and tried members of a
village fire company.</p>

<p class='c013'>At such a time the addition of two more
willing workers can do considerable toward
smothering a fire, especially when there happens
to be no wind moving; and from the moment of
their arrival things began to take on a better
look as though up to then the fight had been
hovering “on the fence,” as Perk called it, and
the balance being overturned, victory was in
sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was in his glory, and the brisk way in
which he hurried those buckets along was worth
going a long way to witness; Jack never would
forget how proud he felt over the marvelous performance
of his running mate, and how those
encouraging cries, so constantly emitted by Perk,
seemed to enthuse everybody with fresh vim and
go.</p>

<p class='c013'>Finally the last spark was extinguished, and
the house saved, having suffered but scant damage.
Then the men, yes, and women too, gathered
around the pair of aviators who had come
on the scene just in the nick of time, to first of
all arouse the people of the prairie ranch to a
sense of the danger that hovered over their heads,
and finally take chances in effecting what might
have been a rough landing, so as to lend their
material aid to the fire fighters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Surely you will not think of starting off again
till break of day,” the big man with the white
head of hair, evidently the rancher himself, was
saying, while engaged in pumping the hands of
the two who had dropped down from the sky,
as it were, to bring warning of the burning roof,
and start the stiff fight against the greedy flames
that had ended so successfully. “Stay and eat
breakfast with us, strangers; we’d like to know
you both some better, and have a chance to thank
you most heartily.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unfortunately we must be on our way, neighbor,”
Jack told him. “It happens we are on
special duty, and delay might upset certain plans
we are bent on following out. It was just by
sheer accident we discovered the fire, and took
the customary means for attracting attention that
all air pilots employ; but some other day, if we
chance to be in this neighborhood, we’d be
pleased to see more of you all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The women added their voices to the pressing
invitation, but Jack was forced to decline, although
doing so smilingly, since he would have
liked very much to see more of these warm-hearted
stockmen and their wild riders, possibly
picking up some useful knowledge concerning
the way a ranch is run in these modern days, so
different from early times in the cattle country.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is absolutely necessary for us to be going,”
Jack told them all, “if we are lucky enough to
be able to hop-off again. Perk, I wish you’d
take a look over toward the west, and see if the
ground is fairly clear; while I talk for a few
more minutes with our new friends here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was astute enough to avoid giving their
names to any one but the ranchman, who readily
promised not to mention them to a living soul;
he felt heavily indebted to Jack and his chum,
and considered that they knew their business
best—for one thing he felt absolutely certain the
fact of their being in such a hurry had nothing
whatever to do with any unlawful act on their
part—he had as much confidence in them as
though Jack had actually confided the fact of
their being Government Secret Service agents,
bound on a mission fraught with much peril to
life and limb, the prime object of which was to
save honest people from being victimized by a
gang of unprincipled sharks, makers of clever
bank notes that were without the pale of the
law and only base counterfeits, although clever
imitations of the genuine bills.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVI <br /> <br />IN THE GRIP OF THE STORM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Perk soon afterwards showed up, and seemed
so cheerful that it was evident his little scouting
mission had yielded favorable results.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems okay to me, partner!” he burst out
with, as soon as she came along; “course it ain’t
just as smooth as some fields we know but there
ain’t goin’ to be any smart trouble takin’ off, I
guess now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And are we holding the nose of the ship
straight in line of the course you took a squint
at, Perk?” Jack asked, as he prepared to climb
into his seat, the people of the ranch clustering
around, to gaze with wide open eyes at the fleet
aircraft, some of them doubtless seeing such a
modern cloud clipper for the first time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dead ahead, boss, an’ you’ll strike the right
racket, I’m tellin’ you,” came the positive assurance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then jump aboard, comrade, and we’ll put
it to the test,” saying which Jack himself climbed
into the waiting cockpit, to settle down in his
accustomed seat, take a quick glance at his dials
when the small light was turned on, and await
a signal from the other sky traveler that he was
“fixed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The way was clear, and the fact that just then
the gay old moon condescended to poke her smiling
face out from behind a mass of clouds assisted
more or less in giving the pilot some of the
necessary illumination—the rest must be left to
his native sagacity and instinct.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a bunch of cottonwoods at some
little distance ahead, the location of which Perk
had pointed out to his mate before settling down
in his seat but if all went well Jack calculated
to be able to clear them in good shape—did it
seem necessary he could swerve slightly to the
right, and have a clear field for the take-off.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a little shouting as the friendly
plane started to taxi along, but of course this was
smothered by the increasing roar of exhaust and
spinning propeller. Faster and faster they scurried
onward, and then started to rise on an angle
just sufficient to nicely clear the tops of the cottonwoods;
when Jack jazzed his motor, to find
it running as “sweet as a purring cat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So they departed only a short time after making
that landing which humanity had demanded
and in times to come the little episode was
likely to afford both aviators more or less satisfaction,
in that they had “seen their duty and
done it,” as Perk would say in his whimsical
way.</p>

<p class='c013'>As they continued on their way Perk found
himself wondering if this interesting adventure
was destined to be a sample of other equally
thrilling happenings in store for them the further
they dipped into the great game that had been
laid at their door by the powers that be at Washington.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whenever he came to thinking of the audacity
shown by Slippery Slim in virtually defying all
the authority of the Government, Perk would
feel his dander rising as if in great indignation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh!” he at one time told himself, being
rather fond of thus communing, as his thoughts
ran on, “we’ll call <i>his</i> bluff just the same, the
scaly ol’ gila monster, you wait an’ see. Thinks
he’s the whole works, the boss man-handler, does
he, just ’cause he’s outguessed a number o’ the
boys. This time he’s due to find himself up
against guys o’ the right size, who’ll jerk him
down off’n his high perch in a jiffy, or I miss
my ticket.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk kept on boasting in his customary
fashion, possibly to keep his mind on the subject.
Jack was paying little attention to side issues
just then for he knew his pal’s peculiarities, and
short-comings as well and having “exhausted
his boiler” Perk presently lapsed into utter
silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had climbed to a fairly high ceiling, and
caught only occasional fugitive glimpses of the
earth far below, when the moon chanced to break
through the banks of clouds, which intervals
became less and less frequent, Jack noticed.</p>

<p class='c013'>He did not altogether fancy the looks of the
heavens, by degrees becoming more and more
overcast; still, this might after all mean next to
nothing and their business was to keep steadily
on their way as if things were bound to come out
all right.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was now drawing well on toward midnight,
and they had placed hundreds of miles between
the city of their recent stay and themselves. Long
since Perk had taken what proved to be his last
glimpse of the vast gulf as seen far away toward
the south, when the night was brightly illuminated,
with the moon’s silvery rays shining on the
glistening waters, and making a picture that
even appealed to Perk’s rugged nature—after
that all he was able to make out was the monotonous
level plains that lay in every quarter,
as though the whole earth consisted of this same
stock country.</p>

<p class='c013'>No longer were they able to find any cheer in
the company of the moon, for the canopy above,
earlier in the night peopled by a multitude of
bright stars, was now gripped in dense masses
of clouds.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having thus lost his guide marks below, Jack
was compelled to place all dependence upon his
faithful instruments, but this of course was an
old story to one of his experience, so that he did
not do any worrying on that score.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, buried in his own thoughts, and paying
scant heed to what changes were taking place
in the signs of the weather, had no warning until
suddenly there came a dazzling flash, that was
almost instantly succeeded by a tremendous burst
of thunder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ginger pop! that means we’re booked for a
bit o’ storm, mebbe, eh, Jack?” was his startled
exclamation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s hope it turns out to be <i>only</i> a bluster,”
the pilot went on to say, as he turned the nose of
his ship upward, and commenced to climb, evidently
in hopes that by so doing they might get
above those low hanging clouds, and have clear
sailing while the disturbance lasted.</p>

<p class='c013'>When shortly afterwards a second electrical
crash almost stunned them by its violence, Perk
began to fumble for his oilskin coat, which he
was never without when aboard a boat with an
open cockpit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk could take a ducking with as much good
nature as the next fellow but just the same he
did not intend to get soaked if he could help it,
since a continuance of the flight, with a cold wind
likely to follow the rain, would not prove to be
the most delightful experience possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>No sooner had he accomplished the job of
securing his raincoat than he gave Jack the well
known signal that he meant to take over the
stick, and thus allow his comrade to also protect
himself against bad weather.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly both of them were presently thus
equipped, and ready to take whatever might be
in the offing. Meanwhile the ascent was continued
in spasms, for there was always a chance
of getting above such a storm, and avoiding the
worst of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The thunder claps became more frequent, and
also much louder, so that each sudden burst gave
them both a thrill, death seemed so close, for
should their speeding ship chance to attract one
of those dazzling bolts it would be all over for
the daring air adventurers, and no one be the
wiser concerning their taking-off, until possibly
after long months had passed, their bleached
bones might be discovered by some party of
plainsmen out looking for rustlers or seeking to
round up missing stock.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus far not a single drop of rain had fallen,
according to Perk’s calculations but the coming
of the drenching flood could not be much longer
delayed, he felt positive. Had there not been
so much racket around them those keen ears of
his might have detected a rushing sound in the
near distance, like the roar of the incoming tide
on the sandy shores of the gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then it came with a swoop, the wind whistling
around their ears and the rain beating a tattoo
against the fuselage of the ship, as well as striking
them smartly in the face, despite such protection
as their helmets and heavy goggles afforded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack certainly had his hands full in managing
the bobbing, shifting craft, gripped by those
shifty gusts that came with giant force, making
the flyers feel as though they were clinging to a
mere chip tossed about in the wild fury of a
Texas tempest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Time and again did Perk feel as though his
heart had jumped up in his throat, almost choking
him; seasoned veteran at this sort of thing
as he believed himself to be, he could not help
this feeling of helplessness in the hands of the
aroused elements; yet each time Jack managed
to bring their ship through the teeth of the storm
in a way that was next door to miraculous, and
if Perk had up to this time not fully appreciated
the astonishing skill and confidence of his younger
companion while at the controls in an emergency,
he certainly was getting his lesson then and
there, in a way to cause it to sink deep, and stick.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch17' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVII <br /> <br />A FIGHT WELL WON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was no longer possible for the busy pilot to
keep on his course. Every minute of his time
was taken up with a desperate effort to keep
from being thrown into a nose dive, that, unless
miraculously conquered, would be likely to
send them whirling down, to crash from a five
thousand foot ceiling, and thus bring about a
complete writeoff.</p>

<p class='c013'>That however was the least of Jack’s worries—all
he asked was the ability and luck to be
able to fend off threatening disaster; could this
be done successfully in good time they could
pick up all that was lost, and once more continue
their westward flight.</p>

<p class='c013'>The battering they endured was simply tremendous,
and Jack marveled at the ship being
able to withstand such a horrible strain. If
but a single strut gave way under all that pounding
it would mean starting a series of similar
mishaps such as would quickly render them incapable
of keeping aloft; and with this threat
hanging over their heads it can readily be understood
neither of the two could be in a comfortable
frame of mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still it is wonderful how men thus threatened
will continue to carry on, although in an almost
mechanical fashion, doing just the necessary
thing with each change of pace on the part of
the tricky storm, and meeting successfully every
near tragedy as it arises to clutch them in its
grip.</p>

<p class='c013'>No longer did Jack keep on climbing—it
seemed to him that the further the staggering
boat lifted the more dangerous became their
situation for the air was surcharged with electricity
as the zigzag lightning darted from cloud
to cloud, doubling the chances of their frail
craft being struck.</p>

<p class='c013'>In fact it seemed so terrible above that he
lacked the nerve to persist in the upward work,
and even commenced to drop down. Perk
noticing this move, hardly knew what to make
of it. He was, as he himself would have expressed
it, “hanging on by his teeth,” in order
to keep his seat in the wildly plunging airship
and on finding that the bold pilot had given up
hope of finding relief in the upper regions, the
fact appalled him. Could it be Jack had decided
to attempt a landing, with only the glare
of those repeated electrical flashes to serve as
airport lights? That indeed would be next to
admitting their case as hopeless, and that Jack
was taking such desperate chances only as a last
resort.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were zooming along all this time as if
pursued by a jinx and indeed with such weird
accompaniments it would not be hard to believe
the spirit of the storm took on the part of such a
goblin of the air, to pursue relentlessly this bold
invader of the home of the aroused elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk hit the bullseye close to the center when
afterwards, in describing their experience on
this night of the great blow, he vowed they were
“playing dice with death,” since it seemed a bare
chance that they could ever pull through alive.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such is the life of the aviator—one hour sailing
smoothly along, at peace with all mankind,
envying no man his following, and feeling himself
to be on the top of the world—the next and
he may be fighting with might and main the
mad demons of the air, his life hanging in the
balance, his strength ebbing fast, and unless the
little cherub aloft that is said to be watching
over each sailor, whether of the sea or the limitless
air, comes to the rescue, his fate is sealed,
and another modern Argonaut never comes back
again to the home port.</p>

<p class='c013'>It did not seem to be any the less exciting even
when they had succeeded in gaining a much
lower altitude; although possibly the danger
from those thunderbolts might have been somewhat
abated. Perk soon realized that his pilot
had no intention of trying for a landing in the
midst of such a turmoil and confusion, which
fact relieved his harried feelings to some extent.
Indeed, it would have been a mad proceeding,
and almost unheard of, since hardly the slightest
chance offered for the most skillful pilot to
reach the earth without disaster, such as making
a ground loop, and having the heavy engine bury
them under its weight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk endeavored to convince himself that
things were a bit easier since a lower altitude
had been effected but in so doing he feared he
was only deceiving himself—if anything at all
things were even worse,—although the drop
might not be so far, which was small comfort,
since it must mean their complete annihilation
if it befell them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had numerous spasms when he fancied
something was going amiss with their staunch
craft, although unable to decide the exact nature
of the imaginary trouble. Despite all these
chills, which must have been the products of his
excitement, they managed to hold out minute
after minute, which fact gave more or less cause
for renewed hope.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack must indeed be almost completely exhausted,
and yet he refused to give up the controls,
to which his hands seemed glued as though
riveted there. Perk punched his side numbers
of times, but could get no favorable response,
proving that the other deemed it too hazardous
a proceeding to change possession of the stick
while in the whirl of that shrieking gale—which
was indeed only another adaptation of the old
proverb “it is folly to change horses when crossing
a stream.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no means for communication with
each other, even though they may have wished
to do so, since the ear-phones had been discarded
with the donning of their slickers, and
could not be put back in position, owing to the
sudden bursting of the storm, and the necessity
for employing their hands in more useful pursuits.</p>

<p class='c013'>All Perk could do was to hang on, keeping
himself ready to seize hold should his companion
be suddenly compelled to release his grip
through sheer weariness—that, and keeping tabs
of the weather, so as to glean the first favorable
sign that came along, promising a let-up, or at
least a break.</p>

<p class='c013'>Judging from the heavy rain that had come
down in such a solid stream it must be reckoned
one of those dreadful cloud-bursts of which he,
Perk, had so often heard, but which thus far in
his experience he had never met up with. No
doubt rivers would be out of their beds long before
dawn although that angle of the situation
did not interest them in the least, since their
traveling would not be interfered with a particle,
if only the air proved inviting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yes, soon Perk believed he could detect a lessening
of the baffling crosswinds that had been
so trying to the pilot, keeping him continually
on the anxious seat—then, too, it struck him the
floods were growing weaker in the bargain;
which two facts gave poor Perk a feeling akin to
joy in the region of his heart, such as he may
have known on previous occasions, but that must
have been far down in his adventurous past.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to their altimeter they were something
like two thousand feet from the ground,
but of course never the faintest glimpse could
they secure of what lay beneath them, so poor
was the visibility, with all that torrent of water
pouring down as might a mountain cataract.</p>

<p class='c013'>This delightful feeling grew stronger as minutes
passed—at this rate he would soon be able
to influence tired Jack to renounce his frozen
hold on the stick, and turn the handling of the
ship over to his chum.</p>

<p class='c013'>In this frame of mind he again nudged the
other, but in turn received a negative shake of
the head, which meant there was “nothing doing”—in
other words, since the storm still raged,
even though in somewhat diminished violence,
they must not be too premature, and spoil it all
just when the victory seemed about to drop into
their hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>With what Perk hoped would prove to be a
last dying spurt the rain came pelting down,
after which it suddenly stopped as though an
unseen hand away up among the clouds, had
plugged the gap, and kept any more water from
running out—enough was enough, surely, Perk
was telling himself when he made this thrilling
discovery and for one he felt he had had sufficient
rain to last him the balance of that year.</p>

<p class='c013'>So too did the wind start to diminish its force,
also coming from one direction with more constancy—some
relief to Jack, that was certain,
since now he could know just how to steer his
turbulent craft so as to meet the force driving
against it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then what did Perk do but start getting his
ear-phones adjusted, being wild to hear a human
voice, after all that fiendish roaring and howling
kicked up by the raging elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>Why, already the atmosphere had cleared
enough for him to catch faint glimpses of what
lay beneath them—it looked as though they had
come to a stretch of country where the level
prairie had changed into rougher ground, with
deep swales, sometimes running into quite respectable
ravines and there were indications of
ridges ahead, which might even prove to be
fairly high, so that it would have been tempting
Providence had Jack dropped still lower, while
flying blind through all that welter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Talk to me ’bout luck,” the grateful Perk
was saying to himself, “I never ran ’cross anything
like <i>this</i>—they told me Jack must a been
born under a lucky star, an’ now I sure b’lieves
it to be the right stuff they were givin’ me, an’
no taffy either. But that was some fight, take
it from me, fellers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards Jack condescended to give
him the sign that he was willing to pass up the
job; whereat Perk quickly superseded him as
pilot, and saw the other sink back in his cramped
quarters as though unable to hold up his tired
arms a second longer. Apparently the relief
had come not a minute too soon, for he must have
been close to the point of utter exhaustion after
so long and violent a strain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Battered as the crate had been while the gale
lashed them so madly, it had stood up under the
buffeting most amazingly and Perk would
never have occasion to utter anything saving
words of praise for the model and its makers;
it must be as near perfection as aircraft are being
built these days of man’s victory over the
savage forces of the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Setting his course in what he believed to be the
proper direction Perk waited until Jack seemed
fairly well recovered, when he was pleased to
see the other take up his head harness as though
he too felt the necessity for opening up communications
with his running mate, which outlook
gratified Perk immensely.</p>

<p class='c013'>There were many things he wished to have
made clear, and besides, he felt more than curious
to learn what Jack’s next move might turn
out to be—that they had drifted far from their
original course went without saying but a means
must be found to recover the lost ground, after
which they could take up the game again just
where the sudden storm had caused such a diversion.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then the moon peeped out through a
break in the clouds overhead, as though to tell
them it was all over, with decent weather once
more in the offing.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch18' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVIII <br /> <br />THE DESERTED SHACK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Well, that’s somehow I guess over, and I’m
mighty glad,” was the way Perk voiced his feelings,
when the clouds were rolling away, and the
heavenly host of stars backed up the moon in
lighting up the firmament.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Same here,” echoed Jack, still more or less
tired after his energetic battle with the unleashed
elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And strikes me the air’s got some chilly,”
added the other; “I own up I’m shivering to
beat the band right now. Where d’ye figger we
might be, partner—must a lost our course in all
that kettle o’ rain an’ wind, an’ drifted far to
the south, eh, what, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question about it, Perk; I could feel the
pull right along; still, there wasn’t a thing to do
but let the old crate take the reins in her teeth.
Once morning comes we’ll manage somehow to
get a line on our locality, and swing back to our
course.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some hours off yet,” ventured Perk, whose
lips were indeed trembling, as if the chill was
beginning to get in its work—perhaps all that
recent excitement was helping to make him
shiver, as it often will, even in the case of the
most valiant of men.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack noticed this fact, even though he himself
experienced nothing similar, for some reason or
other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Perk, you ought to have a chance
to sit alongside a warm fire and dry off; the rain
must have got under your slicker, and I reckon
now you’re slopping around in water back there.
Something’s <i>got</i> to be done about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! boss, don’t bother ’bout me; I’m a
hard-shell you must know, an’ a little dampness
ain’t agoin’ to do me any harm, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just the same we’ll try and make a landing,”
continued the other, “if there’s half a chance;
all I’d want would be to stack up against a level
stretch of upland, where the drainage had carried
off all that flood.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, that sounds all to the good, boy but
what difference will it make, I want to know?
After such a storm it’s bound to be some cold
even away down here along the Texas-Arizona
line; they call them Northers, jest like I’ve heard
they do down in Florida. Forget it, partner—I’m
a tough guy, an’ ain’t wantin’ to be coddled
like a baby.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just the same I say we’re going to land, if
half a chance shows up,” affirmed the pilot, in
that set way of his. “We’ll find the stuff to build
some sort of fire, Perk, where you could make
a pot of hot coffee; which’d do you more good
than a switch of hard liquor. Put that in your
pipe and smoke it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk remained silent for almost two whole
minutes, during which time no doubt he was
revolving in his mind what Jack had proposed—in
imagination he could almost <i>smell</i> the delicious
aroma of the coffee, boiling so merrily
over the red coals and even feel a joyous sensation
of warmth stealing through his chilled body.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Okay, Jack; you win, hands down. Me for
the coffee every time, to be followed by a quiet
smoke o’ my fav’rite brand o’ tobac. Have your
own way about it, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then get ready to try and make out what
sort of ground we’ll soon be passing over,” added
Jack, as he turned the ship earthward, and slid
down on a long glide, with the motor clamped
shut. “We’ll skim along close enough for you
to get a good idea as to how matters stand, and
yet giving enough distance to keep clear of any
clump of trees, or little bald knobs of rises.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently Perk assured him he could manage
to get fair glimpses at what lay below; at which
Jack again started on an even keel, moving with
as little speed as was compatible with safety.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not very long before the watcher gave
tongue.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Looks good to me down yonder, partner—guess
now we might make a safe an’ sane landin’—’specially
with <i>you</i> at the stick. Circulate
a little bit to the south, brother, ’cause it looks
some better thataways.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This Jack did, and then at another signal from
the observer, he proceeded to drop down with
almost as much confidence as he might have felt
when making a landing on Candler Field, well
lighted, and with every convenience suited to
safety and comfort.</p>

<p class='c013'>His confidence, it seemed, had not been misplaced,
for they effected a very fair contact, all
things considered, even though the landing was
somewhat “joggly and rough” as Perk expressed
it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once the ship came to a stop and both of them
hastened to clamber out of their close quarters—“cribbed,
cabined and confined,” Jack sometimes
liked to say in connection with their limited
cockpit, although his pal always reminded him
of the fact that <i>cabin</i> was something only conspicuous
by its absence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk’s first movement was to start threshing
his arms against his thighs with more or less
vigor, in which he showed good common sense
since there is no better method for stirring up
sluggish circulation after a long period of inaction.
Jack on his part commenced to check
up on certain sections of the undergear, meaning
to make certain he had done no damage in making
connection with the earth under such unfavorable
conditions.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything in ship-shape, I reckon, Perk,”
he announced. “And now let’s make out to find
something in the line of trees, where we might
pick up enough wood for that fire.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Looks kinder like things’d be mighty well
soaked after all that downpour,” affirmed the
shrewd Yankee-Canadian; “so it’d be a tough
job coaxin’ stuff to take fire. But wait a minute,
partner—I didn’t get a chance to tell you that I
spied what looked like an ol’ tumbledown shack
over to windward—I guess now it might be
abandoned, but just the same, partner, we’d be
apt to run across some dry wood inside.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suppose you step over and take a look-in,
Perk,” suggested the other. “I’ll stand by the
crate here, and keep our little glim working, so
you’ll get your bearings when you start back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, Jack,” acceded the lanky one,
always eager for any sort of service; “an’ by the
same token now I’ll tote my gun along—never
c’n tell what sorter game you’ll stack up against
on these here Texas plains, I’m told. I feel like
I could knock over a wolf er two, just to get my
blood to movin’ at a faster clip—how ’bout it,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suit yourself, Perk,” he was told, as Jack
climbed back into the cockpit so as to manipulate
the light he mentioned, and which would prove
sufficient to serve the wanderer as a beacon when
wishing to retrace his steps.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly Perk wandered off, having decided
as to the quarter where he had glimpsed
what looked like an old and lonely shack or
cabin, faintly seen in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>He came back in a short time, bubbling over
with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all right, Jack—just like I guessed, it
turned out to be an ownerless shack but the roof
looks like it might’ve shed the rain, an’ oh! boy!
heaps o’ dry wood inside, with a whoppin’ big
fireplace where you could slap on the biggest
log agoin’. Mebbe I ain’t glad you thought o’
this game. Come along, an’ we’ll fetch the stuff
for a warm snack—coffee, crackers, an’ bacon
in the bargain. Talk to me about luck, it’s comin’
to us in big chunks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! we’ve got to get used to that sort of
thing,” said Jack, in the most matter-of-fact tone
imaginable; “when you’re on such a wonderful
lay as this anything’s likely to happen, and all
kinds of surprises spring out at you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder,” was all Perk could say in reply;
but he lost no time in gathering together such
articles as aluminum coffeepot, skillet, cups, and
such other things as he knew would be needed to
complete their little midnight spread.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon it’s safe for us to leave our crate
off here,” remarked the cautious Jack, “but I’ll
fix things so no busybody can take-off while we’re
away,” which he did without any trouble; after
which they both set out to move along to the
deserted shack Perk had located, lying right
there, just as if a favoring Fate had designed it
for their especial benefit in an emergency, as
the grateful Perk told himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Arriving at the humble shack, that once may
have housed a happy family in days that were
gone, they made use of Jack’s electric torch in
order to gather some dry splinters of wood,
which, heaped above some paper on the open
hearth, soon blazed up, and afforded them an
opportunity to take a look around.</p>

<p class='c013'>Other fuel more lasting was hurriedly added
to the fire, and this done the two air adventurers
took stock of their surroundings. There was
nothing much to see, since the shack happened
to be entirely devoid of any kind of furniture,
even of the most primitive make; but the roof
had stood the ravages of time, and promised to
hold out for years still to come.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk held out his chilled hands to the blaze
but only for a few minutes; apparently the possibility
of brewing some “nectar” was an overpowering
temptation, for presently he started to
work.</p>

<p class='c013'>In short order he had the steam coming out
of the coffee pot spout, and a most delightful
odor permeated the interior of that ancient
shack. When the coffee was ready, Perk poured
some of the amber fluid in both aluminum cups,
and offered Jack one, together with a freshly
opened carton of tempting crackers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goes right to the spot,” the self-made <i>chef</i>
observed, rubbing a hand across his stomach, as
though experiencing the most blissful sensation
there; “best coffee I ever tasted, barrin’ none,
an’ say, I’ve tried it a good many places like
France and Germany, as well as in Turkey too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Same here,” Jack assured him, as he drained
his first cup. “By the way, didn’t you say you’d
fetched some bacon along over here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jest what I did, partner, an’ now I’ve had
my fust swaller o’ coffee I’ll get a move on an’
soon have some o’ the same asizzlin’ in the pan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He started to carry out his words, with the
interested Jack watching his efforts to try and
make the frying pan set evenly on the fire, a feat
that requires considerable knowledge of camp
tactics in order to be successful. After one near
spill, with Perk only saving an upset by quick
work, Jack modestly broke in to give a bit of
advice, not forgetting, however, that old saying
about “too many cooks spoil the broth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too hot to keep hold of the handle looks like,
partner; now if only we were outdoors we might
find stones enough to form some sort of foundation
on three sides of the fire, where you could
rest your pan. Hold on, here’s this old hearth
that was made of some kind of Mexican bricks—adobe
they call them and it looks to me like
some of ’em might be loose. Here, I’ll manage to
pry a few up for you, Perk, old man—just hold—your—horses
and——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did not finish his sentence, and the cook,
glancing up to see what ailed him, found his
pal holding the first adobe in an uplifted hand,
while he was himself staring hard into the cavity
from which it had come, as if he saw something
wonderfully fascinating there!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch19' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIX <br /> <br />FORTUNE KNOCKS AT THE DOOR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“I swan! what’s the matter, partner—my
sakes; is it a <i>rattler</i> you uncovered, I wanter
know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk on his part was already sharing the excitement
of his pal, although apparently from
an entirely different reason. He had already
started to scramble to his knees, being doubtless
bent on taking some aggressive action, when he
saw Jack reach forward and deliberately pluck
some object from the hole under the displaced
adobe fire brick, and hold it up to view.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he saw its nature Perk’s jaw dropped, and
he was the picture of abject astonishment—but
it was far from being any poisonous reptile that
Jack was thus exhibiting with such a grand
flourish; just as though he might be some necromancer
or magician, and drawing all manner of
amazing things out of an apparently empty
stove-pipe hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gosh-a-mighty! that looks like real money!
I swan!” burst from Perk’s lips, as he continued
to stare.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just what it’s supposed to be, Pal Perk,”
said Jack, trying to keep his own voice from
displaying a genuine tremolo—“a neat wad of
it, waiting here for us to drop in and pick it up.
Seems like things might be set up, like tenpins
in the alley, for two lucky dogs to knock down
with a couple of rolled balls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If that don’t beat anything I ever did see,”
continued the astounded Perk, now grinning, as
though the pleasant nature of their find was
commencing to appeal to him. “Jest think o’ a
pair o’ air tramps ahappenin’ along, runnin’
across this here deserted shack, an’ findin’ a fortune
askin’ to be taken care of—don’t it beat the
Dutch what c’n happen—Arabian Night’s adventures
can’t hold a candle to the real thing in
these modern days. Some ol’ miser musta hid
that boodle under the bricks, so’s to keep the
Mex raiders comin’ up over the international
border from gettin’ their itchin’ fingers on it—how
’bout that, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Off color, I’m afraid, Perk,” Jack told him,
after taking a quick look at his wonderful find
in the hearth <i>cache</i>; “that miser story might go
with some but it doesn’t wash with me worth
a red cent. In the first place if this money had
been hidden here by a miser, he’d have taken it
away with him when he cut stick. Then again
it would surely have been partly in hard cash,
like gold eagles, and such stuff—all hoards of
misers, you remember, are made up like that,
Perk, and when you give this the once-over
you’ll also notice how it’s all in bills, mostly
fresh ones at that, as if they hadn’t seen much
circulation, as you might say.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk drew in a long breath, and continued to
stare hard at the object Jack was holding out in
front of him; it might be that something in the
other’s words and manner suggested certain possibilities
that seemed almost too staggering for
poor Perk to digest offhand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gee whittiker jewsharps! Jack—what’s this
you’re hintin’ at, ol’ pal—give it to me easy-like,
so I c’n swaller it—all in bills—mostly
fresh ones at that—not seen much handlin’
around—say, are you tryin’ to tell me they’re
every one five dollar bills,—Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon that’s what they are, Perk, I’d say,
from taking a quick look at the same.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bad currency—counterfeits—bogus stuff, er—what?”
gasped the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look for yourself, and you’ll recognize them
as having been printed from the same plates as
the one we’re carrying with us as a sample of
Slippery Slim’s best work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Je-ru-salem crickets! I’m knocked silly for
a fact,” whimpered Perk; and then, as if mustering
up his vanishing stamina he went on to add:
“but however could they’ve got right there under
that brick—conjurer’s black magic, looks
like to me, partner, it sure does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nonsense! that part of it is easy enough to
figure out,” asserted Jack, as usual very matter-of-fact;
“the only thing that seems to border on
the miraculous is our running across this packet
of all the people in the Far West—it looks to
me as if some sort of Destiny might be handling
the cards—that all we have to do is to keep moving
and everything’s bound to come our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure does seem like a snap, and that’s a fact,”
agreed Perk, calming down a little as he began
to grow more accustomed to the great discovery
that had resulted from their deciding to drop
down, and have a sociable cup of hot coffee;
“but I’ll be danged if I c’n make head or tail
out o’ this happening—now, what under the sun
did anybody want to stick that wad o’ long green
under the same adobes, I’d like to know, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! there might be any number of answers
to that question, Perk; for instance didn’t we
learn that it was the habit of Slim, or one of his
busy bees, to jump across the border every little
while with a load of the flimsy, and dole the stuff
out to a number of agents he has working with
him in this section of the country, also all the
way over to Los Angeles and San Diego?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was the spiel they gave us, for a fact,
boss,” admitted Perk, wagging his head eagerly,
as though he felt certain clever Jack would be
able to figure things out, and hit on some sort of
explanation that would cover these mysterious
happenings.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, this, then, might be one of his hidden
<i>caches</i>—at certain times this unknown agent
hides some <i>real</i> money in such a hole as this, and
comes along another dark night it might be to
pick up the big wad that was left in exchange
for the small one he contributed. And that is
the way the game runs, so I was told.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“By gum! but what grand luck for us to come
in on this deal, Jack—pretty soft, I’d call it,
and neither of us had any hand in it either—just
hit on this little bank by sheer chance! Goin’
to crib the loot, are you, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack scratched his head as though certain
plans were flitting through it, and he must make
a choice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, we have to start somewhere, you understand,
Perk, and it looks like the finger of
Fate might be pointing right at this shack, and
telling us to get busy and pick up a strong clue
that, if followed up, would take us straight to
that hideout Slim’s got across in Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess I see what you mean now, brother,”
ventured Perk, his face lighting up with extreme
joy; for he felt they were already on the track,
and that from that hour there must be rapid
action continuously. “If so be that ’ere critter
that slams out these bills on greenhorns and
come-ons is gettin’ anxious to see what sorter
prize he’s drawn in the lottery, why, he might
jest come along any ol’ time now, since the
storm’s over an’ there’s nawthin’ to hold him up.
Got any idea he’s nigh due here, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shouldn’t be a bit surprised if he walked in
on us any time,” ventured Jack; and then, seeing
the puzzled look on his chum’s rugged face
he went on to add: “I didn’t mention the fact
but while we were making our way over from
the ship I felt certain I glimpsed several far-off
lights, as if they might be in windows of cabins
or houses of some sort. Then, too, I surely did
hear a big dog barking, and something like a
rooster crowing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I’ll be jiggered if you ain’t got sharper
ears than I c’n boast, Jack, ol’ hoss, which ain’t
no lie either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t you believe it, Perk; it just happened
that you were so wrapped up in thinking of that
coffee treat you didn’t pay as much attention to
outside things as I did. So it seems as if there
might be some kind of a village or prairie town
not more than two miles from this abandoned
old shack and if that’s so then the chances are
this agent who’s been working the public for
Slim probably lives there. Then again, like as
not he has a pretty good idea about when his
bunch of kale ought to be placed under that
brick—in fact he might have made his way out
here this very night only for the storm threatening.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, partner,” Perk hastened to say, brimful
of energy, “which, bein’ the case, it’s up to
us to lay a sweet little mantrap, so’s to trip him
by the heels if so be he knocks on our door.
How’ll we fetch it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“First of all we’ll finish our supper, and clean
up here,” came the ready explanation; “he may
smell the odor of coffee and bacon, but then you
might expect this shelter to be used once in a
while by Mexican tramps, or passing cowboys,
especially when a big storm threatens, so that
isn’t going to scare the Johnny. As for us, we’ll
fix things so as to give him a nice little surprise,
by hiding out, after making things all dark inside
here, with water thrown on the fire to
smother the hot coals, after which there’s nothing
to do but take things easy until he shows up—if
he does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sabbe, okay, partner; let’s get busy, for
the bacon’s done brown to a turn.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch20' class='c014'>CHAPTER XX <br /> <br />SPRINGING THE TRAP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There was much that must be done before they
could feel satisfied they had their mantrap arranged.
Jack realized that if the party who
played the part of local agent for the counterfeiter
gang had been kept from coming to secure
the fresh supply of bogus bills by the threatening
storm, he was likely to make his appearance
at almost any time, since all danger from the
electrical disturbance was now past.</p>

<p class='c013'>They finished their little supper without
wasting any more time, after which the matter
of hiding all traces of their presence was taken
up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See if you can find any water outdoors,
Perk,” Jack was saying, as he contemplated the
red embers of their late fire. “Seems to me I
stepped in some sort of a puddle while coming
up to the door. Here’s an old rusty can that
looks as if it’d hold a quantity—I want to dash
it on these coals so as to cool them off. That
done we’ll find some way to hide, and watch developments.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk sized up the situation cleverly enough,
and lost no time in setting about doing as his pal
suggested. When he came back he was carrying
the rusty can, which did leak a trifle, but
then that made no particular difference, so long
as enough water remained to put the fire out.</p>

<p class='c013'>It sizzled, and steamed a bit but Perk distributed
the fluid contents of his can with such
discretion that all this was speedily brought to
a finish, with the last red ember cooled off, leaving
a dead little pile of wood ashes as the only
reminder of their blaze.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now that’s settled, partner,” said the always
ready Perk, “what comes next on our program?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had his hand electric torch in use, for
otherwise they must have been left to grope
around, since the clouds continued to drift past
in clusters, shutting out most of the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We must gather up everything here that
might give us away, for like as not the fellow’ll
fetch some kind of a light along with him—lantern
it may turn out to be, because he knows its
apt to be pretty dark inside the old shack, and
he can’t do much just by fumbling around.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! that’s right, boss,” returned Perk,
commencing to gather up any and all their
scanty belongings, not forgetting that convenient
rifle of his. “But I say, how ’bout the bus—won’t
he lamp the thing settin’ there in the open
an’ ain’t it apt to give him a bad start?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had duly considered that very point in
making up his plans, and was ready to meet the
situation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Taken it all in all, buddy, there’s small danger
of that happening,” he went on to tell Perk.
“First, remember, the ship lies on that side of
the shack away from the spot where I glimpsed
those lights and if he comes along in a direct
line from the town there isn’t one chance in three
of him noticing it. Even if he does I reckon
he’ll feel dead certain only his own messenger’d
be flying in this region—he may never have seen
another crate besides the one sent out by Slippery
Slim.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She sounds good to me, Jack an’ I’m willin’
to take a shy at the target, if so be you guess it’s
straight goods, all wool’n a yard wide. Let’s
go!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly both passed out of the deserted
shack that had proved such a fortunate harbor
for them after the late storm. Jack knew what
they must do in following up the little plan he
had framed, with a view of giving the suspect
the shock of his life and without any further
preliminaries he set about carrying out the few
details.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a chink or two in this further wall,”
he went on to say, in a low voice, next door to a
whisper, “that will furnish us means for keeping
tabs on what’s going on inside. We’ll settle down
there, and just wait. As luck has it that side of
the shack is away from the moon, which is all in
our favor, in fact everything seems to be arranged
just to suit our plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bully set-up, boss, couldn’t be better for a
fact,” agreed the hopeful Perk, who firmly believed
in the element of Luck, and was immensely
gratified to discover how that little god
was working over-time in their favor—according
to his way of thinking it was always “better
to be born lucky than rich.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it?” whispered Jack, after they
had commenced to crouch down in the darkened
spot he had selected.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just great, that’s all,” Perk assured him,
“show me where one o’ them cracks c’n be located,
partner, an’ then I’ll be okay—all
fixed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack obliged by directing his chum’s hand to
an opening, through which it would be easy
enough to keep watch over any happening inside
the shack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Next we’ll creep over to this further corner,
and try to find out when he comes along,”
continued Jack. “From now on, Perk, keep
your tongue between your teeth—no talking, remember,
but if it does seem to be absolutely
necessary, put your lips close to my ear, and
whisper—get that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nuff sed, boss, I’m on,” came faintly from
the figure crouching at Jack’s side, after which
abject silence fell upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>A little later on Perk, now that his hearing
was strained so as to pick up any kind of sound,
however slight, caught the barking of a watchdog;
it seemed to be at a considerable distance
from the shack, and he judged there might be a
couple of miles lying between. This was not a
great amount of ground to cover, if only the inducement
were sufficiently urgent and that fat
packet of enticing bank bills, supposed to be
secreted under the adobes of the old hearth, must
represent an alluring prize, capable of drawing
a chap who was fond of “easy money” out of his
snug home at this unseasonable hour of the
night, and indulging in a little hike, for which
effort he would fancy himself well repaid.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some time passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>They lay there just back of the comer of the
dilapidated and abandoned shack, waiting, listening,
and frequently feeling a little thrill when
some soft sound came stealing to their ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Perk plainly heard what was surely a
low cough, such as might be caused by a sudden
tickling in the throat. Some one was undoubtedly
approaching the spot, and coming from the
west, where they understood the prairie hamlet,
or village, lay at the foot of a small ridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>He merely touched his companion’s right arm
to let Jack know something was in the wind.
The cough was repeated, so that Perk chuckled
softly to himself, as if more than ever convinced
that luck was bent on handing them out further
fat plums.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was already creeping back so as to reach
the spot where those convenient peepholes could
be found and of course Perk imitated his example.
Thus it came about they were in complete
readiness to make good use of their eyes
when a slight scratching sound came from
within, and a tiny flash announced that the newcomer
had struck a match.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk could see him there down on his knees,
and intent on applying his lighted match to the
wick of a lantern he had evidently fetched along
for this very purpose. If Perk could have analyzed
the feeling that possessed him just then he
must have compared it to the exultation of a cat
when about to make a jump upon a sparrow,
close up to which he had managed to hide, all
prepared for the finishing act of the ambush.</p>

<p class='c013'>No sooner had the man succeeded in lighting
his lantern than with eager hands he commenced
lifting the adobe under which Jack had again
artfully placed the bait in the shape of that
tempting packet of bogus notes.</p>

<p class='c013'>How eagerly he pounced on the contents of
his queer <i>cache</i>, all the avariciousness of a miser
handling his hoard was displayed and at the
same time he looked hurriedly from one side to
the other, as though his guilty soul, conscious of
having thus broken the law of his country, was
already seeing the long arm of Justice stretching
out menacingly toward him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack evidently had seen enough to satisfy him
the genuine criminal was in focus, and that there
could be no miscarriage of Justice in effecting
his capture with the goods upon him. He was
creeping toward the open door of the shack, evidently
bent on taking the slick partner of the
counterfeiter chief by surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk lost no time in crawling at his pal’s heels,
bent on having a hand in the closing scene of the
little drama—he wanted to see with his own
eyes just how such a slimy beast would take his
“bump” when he found the meshes of the net
closing around him.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon looking in at the open door.
The man still knelt there on the hard earthen
floor of the shack, and appeared to be nervously
fumbling the sheaf of bills, as though trying to
count them, and be assured that he had received
the full amount to which he was entitled—that
there had been no “holdout” attempted.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps one of them happened to make a
slight sound—either that, or else the man’s guilty
soul caused him to fancy he heard something
for he turned his head. It chanced that the
light of the lantern fell full upon his dark face,
and disclosed the distended eyes filled with terror,
as well as the expression so ghastly that
passed athwart his countenance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put ’em up!” commanded Jack, sharply, in
a voice that would brook no nonsense and as if
mechanically influenced to obey, the wretched
trapped distributor of bad notes raised both
hands, the packet falling to the floor as if his
nerveless fingers could no longer retain their
grip.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and Perk stepped blithely into the
lighted shack, the former with his ready automatic
covering the badly shaken rogue, Perk
trailing his rifle in a suggestive way, as if able
to back his boss up on the slightest provocation.</p>

<p class='c013'>First frisking the other, and removing a gun
from his back pocket, Jack made a motion with
his hand as he set Perk to work.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get the bracelets on him, partner, then we’ll
ask him a few leading questions before we make
up our minds what the next step’ll be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But—hold on, Mister,” whined the poor
devil, all aquiver as he groveled there on his
knees; “I ain’t done nawthin’—this hear ain’t
my stuff—I jest suspicioned Jud he must a had
somethin’ hid out this way, ’case he kep’ comin’
an’ agoin’, so I kim tuh see what it mout be. Now
I knows he must a robbed thet bank over in
Tucson when he went off with a gang he runs
with.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stow that gab,” said the disgusted Perk,
“that’s all too flimsy to wash. We got you to
rights an’ where the hair’s short, an’ you’ll have
a chanct to see what the inside o’ the pen at Atlanta’s
like. This here’s counterfeit long-green,
an’ you knows it, mister,” with which cutting
remark he snapped a pair of steel handcuffs
upon the other’s wrists with the skill only one
accustomed to handling such “safety-first” contraptions
could display, proving that for one of
Slippery Slim’s active lieutenants the show was
indeed over.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch21' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXI <br /> <br />PICKING UP CLUES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>By this time the man whom Uncle Sam’s two
clever sky detectives had trapped, showed signs
of being almost in a state of collapse. Too late
did he realize what a terrible mistake he had
made when yielding to the blandishments of
Slippery Slim Garrabrant, and acting under the
belief that he could defy the law and get away
with it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the big idea, partner,” Perk was asking
after he and Jack had fixed things so there
was no possible chance for their prisoner to
break away, and give them the laugh. “Do we
jump off right now, or wait till mornin’, I’d like
to know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No hurry at all,” was the calm reply, “I
want to go over our crate once more before we
start that hop across to the California border,
I’ve good reason to believe things are okay but
a second overhauling will satisfy me better.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I kinder guess you won’t want me to slip
over to this here town, an’ pick up a few fresh
eggs, eh, boss?” and Perk’s voice actually took
on a wheedling vein as he made this remark
for if there was anything he dearly loved along
the line of “eats” it was those same “fresh eggs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack shook his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hardly think it would be wise,” he observed;
“we don’t know the lay of the land for one thing—it
might be this party has some backing among
his neighbors, and we’d find ourselves in a hornets’
nest before we knew what was what. No,
we can stick it out here the balance of the night,
which is pretty well gone right now, and be off
about sunrise.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a lot more stuff around in here that’d
burn right well,” insinuated Perk; “how ’bout
another bit o’ fire—this night air feels some cool
to me an’ ’sides, we’d have a blaze ready so’s to
boil more coffee ’fore we kick off, eh, what,
partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Please yourself so far as that goes, Perk, I
reckon it wouldn’t feel at all bad to have some
fire, as we must hang out here several hours.
But don’t make any noise if you can help it.
Besides, we ought to keep an eye out for trouble,
no telling what this slick chap might work off
on us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! we’ll one o’ us keep watch off’n on,”
promised Perk, starting without any further delay
to gather some fuel, and get a blaze going.</p>

<p class='c013'>While he was thus engaged Jack took their
prisoner in hand, and commenced to grill him.
There was nothing of the dreaded “third degree”
rough-house measures in what Jack attempted
but he tried to show the man where his best interests
lay.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re in a bad fix, my friend,” Jack told
him: “and unless you come clean, so as to help
us round up the balance of your outfit, you’ll
be certain to get the full penalty the law lays
down. We know a whole lot about Slippery
Slim and his ways, and are dead certain we’re
bound to end up his graft before many more
days pass by. So when you’re answering my
questions don’t try to lie to me, for like as not
I’ll be already acquainted with the facts and
know you’re trying to beat around the bush.
Dangerous business, let me tell you; far better
for you to hold your tongue than deceive me.
Come clean, and I promise you I’ll do everything
in my power to have you let off easy, besides no
one need know you’ve turned State’s evidence.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he started in to put pointed questions,
concerning certain points that were vital to his
plans. Once he caught the man squirming under
the lash, and giving an answer that he very well
knew was like “beating around the bush.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know better than that, my friend,” he
told him sharply, “that’s only half a truth you’ve
given me. Don’t try it again if you know what’s
good for your health, or it’ll be a matter of possibly
ten years before you see your family again.
Stick to the truth, and it may be only a question
of six months you’ll spend at Atlanta behind the
bars. Now tell me again what I wanted to know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He had managed to impress his strong personality
upon the writhing wretch, who was
ready to throw himself unreservedly upon his
mercy and so the answers were given without
hesitation, although in some instances the man
declared he did not know, as he had only once
been across the line and visited Slippery Slim
in his hideout among the Mexican mountains.</p>

<p class='c013'>When Jack realized that he had really pumped
the other dry, he felt he had profited in many
ways and that their sudden determination to
make, a night landing, so as to recover after their
buffeting by the storm, had been a most fortunate
happening indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>For one thing he had learned that the name
of their frightened prisoner was Simeon Hawkins,
and that he had a wife and several children
living in the little prairie town only a few miles
distant—a fact that seemed to give him great
distress, now he found his avaricious dreams
wrecked, and himself in the hands of a couple
of those very same Secret Service detectives
whom the “big boss” had undoubtedly referred
to so contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had been “listening in,” and chuckling
happily whenever he realized his mate had made
some sort of a “ten-strike,” picking up valuable
information that was destined to ultimately
serve their ends wonderfully, and help to “pot
their game.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They sat there for some time, talking in low
tones. The man who lay close by helpless was
silent as a rule, although several times he uttered
a dismal groan, when his feelings overpowered
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess I’ll step out, partner,” remarked Perk
at one time, “an’ slip over to the ship, I’d sure
hate to have some critter do us a bad turn by
meddlin’ with any o’ them dials an’ gadgets.
What I wouldn’t do to <i>him</i> would be a caution,
that’s right.”</p>

<p class='c013'>From the fact that Perk carried his rifle along
with him his meaning was not difficult to understand
and Jack felt sorry for the chap who was
at the other end of the gun sights when his pal
pulled the trigger.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk cautiously approached the grounded
ship, and started when discovering some moving
object just in its shadow. The moon was shining
brightly now, so that it was an easy matter to see
for quite some little distance, although so deceptive
was the light that even sharp-eyed Perk
could hardly have told whether some dark object
seen fifty feet off was a stump or a black dog
sitting there and watching him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Waiting until the object moved again, he discovered
he had been wise to hold his fire, for by
then he had made it out to be some species of
animal. He took several forward steps, whereupon
the beast started to move off, uttering a
little nasty snarl while doing so.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks, on’y a stinkin’ kiote after all, skulkin’
’round to see if he c’n stir up a little grub o’ any
kind. Get out, you varmint!” and he waved his
gun above his head while starting to run forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>This completely demoralized the cowardly
prairie marauder, so that he took to his heels,
and quickly vanished in the near distance. Perk
found everything all right when he gave the
stranded plane “the once over”; and being satisfied
that there was nothing to be feared from a
coyote prowling around in search of a supper or
breakfast, he returned to the shack to report all
well.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was busily engaged making certain notes,
and reading others connected with their present
business, as jotted down in his memorandum
book in a peculiar brand of short-hand all his
own, but which would appear as so much Greek
or Choctaw to any one else.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Better turn in, and get a few winks of sleep,
brother,” he told Perk, who had yawned once or
twice as he sat before the fire. “I’ll wake you up
in about an hour or so when you can take your
turn playing sentinel, until the dawn shows up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just as you say, old hoss,” came the ready
reply; “fact is, I’m a bit drowsy, an’ could get
away with a few winks; but don’t forget to wake
me when the hour’s up, remember.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s all right, partner,” Jack told him,
laughingly; “we’re in this game thirty-thirty,
and you’ll have your turn, depend on it. Now
get busy, and don’t you dare snore above a whisper
either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I do jest gimme a poke, Jack—tryin’ to
break myself o’ that nasty habit but I got to
have help, you know—no feller ain’t wholly responsible
fur what he does when he’s asleep.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In due time Jack aroused the other, and himself
sought a brief period of forgetfulness in
sleep. So the balance of the night passed, and
morning came with a clear sky, and a promise of
decent weather for the continuance of their
flight.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch22' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXII <br /> <br />OVER ARIZONA DESERTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Perk must have dreamed about that hot coffee
treat he had been promising himself, for when
Jack opened his eyes he found his comrade already
watching the bubbling pot, from which
delightful odors were commencing to escape in
the way of steam.</p>

<p class='c013'>They enjoyed quite a decent little breakfast,
what with the ambrosia contained in their aluminum
cups together with some crackers and jam,
after the crisp bacon had been disposed of. Jack
offered some to their prisoner, but the man sadly
shook his head, as if to say he had no appetite
whatever.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was not a bad looking fellow, only with a
weak sort of chin, and evidently built along a
line that could be easily tempted to go wrong if
the inducement were only gilded enough. Jack
felt sorry for him, especially since he had learned
about his family; and was determined to do what
he could so as to get Simeon off, should his information
prove of any value to their cause.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once breakfast was disposed of they all went
over to where the ship lay. By this time Simeon
had found that they really planned to carry him
off with them, a startling fact that added to his
alarm, for apparently he had never been up in
a plane, and a species of stage-fright made him
shake as if he had the ague.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there was no other way to work things,
for should they set him free the chances were
the man, forgetting his promise, would try to
send out some kind of warning to Slippery Slim,
and in the end he and Perk were apt to pay dearly
for their slip-up, perhaps even with their own
lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>When playing such a desperate game with so
canny a lawbreaker it would be the height of
folly to let the dictates of tender hearts turn
them from the path of “safety first,” and Simeon
must continue to “take his medicine,” even
though the innocent ones at home suffered for
his misdeeds—he had never considered others
whom his evil actions had doubtless harmed,
when they found themselves arrested for passing
worthless bills, and how could he expect these
sworn officers of the law to go easy with him
when caught in the act?</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk now began to wonder just how they
would be able to “tote” a third party in the limited
accommodations afforded by the double
cockpit of their ship. It was bound to prove a
tight squeeze, and not so comfortable but then
why grumble on account of a trifle like that,
when Fortune was giving them such a glad hand
all the while?</p>

<p class='c013'>He began to shift things around some while
Jack was busy checking the motor, struts, undergear,
and propeller, with the design of condensing,
and making more room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Funny how you c’n jam things into such a
small compass when you really an’ truly try,”
he told Jack, when he had finished his task. “I
kinder guess I’ll be able to fix him okay, ’cause
he’s no great shakes at size, an’, seems like to
me, he’s shrinkin’ right afore my eyes, he’s that
shaky. Then it’s only for the day, I figger; how
’bout that, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve planned all that out, partner,” he was
told. “As soon as we get over to the California
border we’ll give him in charge of some sheriff
to keep in the hoosgow till we’ve made our killing,
and are ready to deliver the whole batch to
Uncle Sam’s nearest U. S. District Attorney,
at Los Angeles or San Diego. That clear to you,
Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say it was, boss, an’ here’s hopin’ we’ll
get there with both feet when the end shows up,
our prisoners hobbled, an’ with nice new steel
bracelets decoratin’ their wrists. Now to get
the gent aboard the boat, an’ stowed away.
Shucks! he acts like he might be scared out o’ a
year’s growth—some sillies get that way ’bout
goin’ up in a skyscraper the fust time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>His scorn for such a weakling showed in his
face as he helped Simeon to clamber into the
cockpit. The man was as white as a sheet, and
trembling as if expecting to meet with some dire
end in short order, once he left the firm ground
and took to the boundless air. His groans were
heartrending, and Jack felt sorry for the wretch
but for once Perk displayed no signs of sympathy,
it was all so silly in his opinion.</p>

<p class='c013'>He proceeded to take precautions by fastening
the greenhorn in by means of a stout strap which
would prevent his falling out should conditions
necessitate a sudden banking on the part of the
pilot, or a fierce gust of wind cause the ship to
give a unannounced plunge.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All ready, Jack,” announced Perk, after
completing these arrangements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll be with you inside of three minutes,” he
was told, and as the ground ahead had been examined,
and found to be fairly good for the
wheels to trundle over, there seemed to be nothing
more that could be done, only put things to
the test.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was “some rough,” as Perk told himself,
when violently shaken once or twice but they
managed to get up sufficient speed to admit of
Jack lifting her when the right time arrived.
Then they were off, rising like a bird, and almost
immediately opening up the village that nestled
there two miles off, at the foot of the low ridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack headed straight into the west, for that
was their route “as the crow flew.” He cared
not at all that they would pass directly over the
settlement, for few of the people were apt to be
abroad at such an early hour, nor would they
be any the wiser for seeing a plane pass overhead
at such a low altitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, looking down, found himself wondering
which of the modest cottages in line of his vision
chanced to be the home Simeon had spoken of
with such a catch in his voice. The man had
temporarily forgotten about his fears concerning
his own safety, while being carried so high above
the surface of the earth—he was stretching his
neck, and eagerly focussing his staring eyes on
one spot, which evidently held all that he held
dear. Perk ignored his recent sensation of scorn,
and actually felt sorry for the man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor guy,” he was saying under his breath,
though the other could not have heard him had
he shouted at the top of his lungs, on account of
the racket being kicked up by combined motor
and propeller, “he feels right bad ’cause he’s
goin’ off without a chanct to say goodbye. Well,
I on’y hope this will be a lesson to Simeon, an’
he’ll quit playin’ with a buzz-saw, which is the
long arm o’ our Uncle Samuel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon tried his best to keep tabs of the lonely
little hamlet until it was no longer possible to
distinguish objects, owing to the several miles
of distance the speeding plane had covered; then
he fell back in his seat, and let his head drop
on his chest, while his body shook with emotion.
In that dreadful moment he would undoubtedly
have only too gladly given all he had in the wide
world for a chance to undo the wrongs he had
committed in his haste to get rich.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! he orter thought o’ that before, while
the goin’ was good!” was Perk’s comment, who
had seen just such short-sighted men more than
once before in his eventful life, and had a philosophical
mind concerning all such late repentances.
“But I’m sure sorry for them that are
agoin’ to suffer the most—he deserves all he’ll
get, but they’re the innocent ducks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The plane soared along its set course, and as
they were not at more than something like five
thousand feet altitude, Perk could see very well,
when he adjusted the binoculars they carried of
necessity, so as to be able to spy out conditions
before trusting themselves to land, being naturally
a bit suspicious while thus drawing steadily
nearer to what might well be called enemy land.</p>

<p class='c013'>From time to time he found himself gazing
down with considerable curiosity upon scenes
which were mostly foreign to his eyes—he had
only too often scrutinized pictures where uncounted
troops belonging to the enemy were encamped,
or on the march, with monster guns
making the very air quiver with the tumult of
their discharges; where rival pilots came up in
answer to his insulting challenge, to engage him
in deadly combat—he had seen many an unlucky
or less skillful airman go down with his whirling,
blazing coffin, yielding up his life as a tribute
to what he called patriotism—all these and a
multitude of similar thrilling spectacles could
be unrolled in memory as he thus sailed the
azure sky, and saw Jack meet and conquer successive
air pockets lying in wait to give him battle;
and yet this was actually the first time Perk
had ever focussed his gaze upon a genuine cattle
ranch, and saw stock being driven to market,
or it might be mavericks branded; so that he
found himself entranced with the panorama
spread before him as they glided over the prairies
of New Mexico.</p>

<p class='c013'>There cropped up other and like interesting
sights when the wilder sector of country was
reached, with its deep gullies, its bare-topped
mountain peaks—perhaps stretches of desolate
desert where nothing could be seen save billowy
sandy wastes, except possibly patches of yucca,
sage, greasewood, and prickly pear cactus.</p>

<p class='c013'>When, his interest increasing, Perk begged
his comrade to drop down so as to give him a
nearer view of these strange sights, he was able
to increase his knowledge concerning the myriad
of strange sights to be picked up when touring
by air in new territories—now he could make
out the fantastic Joshua trees that seemed to be
engaged in a shimmering dance in the blazing
sunlight; moving shadows that sometimes crossed
the line of his vision he made out to be buzzards
on the wing, circling in search of their carrion
meal; while others on the ground he recognized
as coyotes skulking along, frightened by the sight
and noise coming from far over their heads, and
trying to reach their secret dens in some rocky
canyon or defile.</p>

<p class='c013'>Noon came in due time, with the ship keeping
up its steady grind, and having left hundreds of
miles in its wake.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk began to realize that he had eaten his
breakfast at an unearthly hour, and concluding
that a bite of something, together with a swig of
water from their jug, might go well, he mentioned
the interesting fact that the usual lunch
hour had come, at which Jack nodded his head,
as if to leave all that sort of thing to the discretion
of his trusted pard.</p>

<p class='c013'>So they had a pick-up snack, which was quite
acceptable to the two airmen, able to enjoy their
meals even while cutting capers up among the
clouds. It was another thing to the novice
Simeon, whose appetite had not come back,
though he did manage to swallow a few bites,
and have a drink of cold water to wash things
down. By slow degrees he was getting the upper
hand of his dreadful fears, for while familiarity
could not be said to bring contempt, nevertheless
he was becoming accustomed to the conditions,
and could even display a trace of curiosity
when looking down on some unusually interesting
spectacle to which Perk was pointing so
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>If things continued to exist as they had been
doing all morning it was likely—Jack at one time
told his co-pilot in answer to a question—that
they would be close to the California border by
sunset, or shortly afterwards; since even then
they were well along across Arizona, with fair
skies still beckoning them on their way.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch23' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIII <br /> <br />ON TO THE COLORADO</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Listen, Perk, I’ve got something you should
know—something that hinges on a change of
plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was saying this at a time when, relieved
from the controls he could enter into one of the
little confabs that their use of the ear-phones
allowed. All Perk had to do was to lean forward
and while still handling the stick drink
in whatever his co-pilot chose to say.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! spit it out then, partner,” was his familiar
way of inviting confidence and which
meant so much with those who knew Perk’s peculiar
sayings best.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be sure Simeon Hawkins was sitting close
beside Perk, and what Jack meant to confide in
his running mate could never be intended for
his ears but despite this elbow to elbow touch
there was not the slightest risk of his being able
to pick up a single word, owing to the clamor
kicked up by motor exhaust and propeller.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re going on a bit further than was arranged,”
said Jack, concisely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! meanin’ we don’t pull up when we
strike the border, eh, what, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just that, brother—the going is good, and
we might as well keep moving till we drop down
on the Metropolitan Airport grounds.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whoopee! you mean at Los Angeles, don’t
you, old hoss?” demanded Perk, apparently considerably
surprised by his pal’s bald statement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Righto, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How come, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get this fixed in your noodle,” said the resting
chief pilot—“circumstances often alter cases,
they tell us; well, when we figured on halting at
or near the border, close to the Gila River,
things hadn’t happened such as have hit us since
then.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Meanin’ the storm, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was one thing,” admitted the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Knockin’ us out o’ our reckonin’, like, an’
makin’ us take a forced landin’ on the open
prairie where we run across that flimsy ol’ shack—does
that cover what you mean, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“After a fashion it does,” the other told him,
adding: “like the play of Hamlet, with Hamlet
left out, it falls flat. You omitted the chief reason
for my making this change in plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess you must mean Simeon here, eh
boy?” asked Perk, as if suddenly waking up to
the fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing—what are we going to do with
<i>him</i>, tell me, Perk? It’d be impossible for us
to lug him everywhere we mean to go, flying
across into Mexico, and baiting the wolf in his
own lair, as you might say. He’d be a constant
hindrance to our being free to act besides, we’d
run a fat chance of having him give us away,
just when we thought it was all over but the
shouting.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, Jack—it means you don’t trust his
promises to lend us a helpin’ hand, and goin’
back on his pals—ain’t that the idea?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it,” replied Jack, never bothering
to drop his voice a particle, knowing as he did
that without the aid of those valuable ear-phones
Simeon, humped up against the side of Perk,
could not have caught what was said even
though it had been shouted at the top of his
voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what then, partner?” continued Perk,
apparently still groping in the dark.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing to hinder our tripping right along
till we fetch up at Angeles, when we can find a
way to hand him over to the Federal agents located
there. He’s connected with the big gang
against which Uncle Sam’s declared war to the
knife; and as a material witness, ready to turn
State’s evidence, they’ll be only too well pleased
to hold him <i>incommunicado</i>, so he can’t do a
thing to warn the bunch the big push is on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Okay, Jack. Sounds mighty good to me,
you bet. I’d never a cudgeled my brains enough
to hatch up an idea like that; takes you to think
o’ clever dodges, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then we’ll consider it settled, eh, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just what we will,” came the confident reply.
“’Bout when ought we raise the last beacon
on the road to Angeles, an’ lamp the field
lights at that same Metropolitan Airport?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! if everything goes well, you might call
it along toward midnight,” Jack assured him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got aplenty o’ gas to carry on that far, I’d
guess?” hazarded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s to be hoped so,” said Jack; “because
there’s some mighty tough stretches of country
between the Colorado and the big Pacific city.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! so I understand, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And it would be a bad job for us if we had
to hit the ground where you couldn’t scrape up
a decent landing place with a fine-tooth comb.
When I take the stick again, Perk, maybe you’d
better have a look in, so’s to get tabs on our fuel
tank, and tell me how it stands. From the dial
finger yonder I figure we’ll have a lot more than
enough to see us through.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s right, boss,” affirmed Perk, after casting
a hasty glance at the tell-tale figures so
plainly marked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That settles it then,” with which remark
Jack showed by his actions that further conversation
was needless.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Simeon sat there through it all, never
once dreaming how his fate was being so calmly
settled; doubtless he imagined the consultation
had been about something connected with the
running of the cloud-chaser, and covered facts
such as would have been all Greek to him, even
had he been able to listen in.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was not at all bothered by this change
of plans on the part of the head pilot—it mattered
little when they managed to drop down at
the airport—chances were the ground lights
were kept on full through the whole of each
night, since air mail planes would be apt to
come and go, some of them having been thrown
out of their regular schedules by dense mountain
fogs, or head winds that cut down the customary
speed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, also, was well acquainted with the
courtesy to be encountered at all such well conducted
flying fields, where every one would be
eager to do whatever was possible for the comfort
of those who chose to visit such ports, and
show little or no undo curiosity connected with
the reason for their coming.</p>

<p class='c013'>True, they might turn out to be a bit short
with the “eats;” but Perk, who knew the ways
of his pal so well, felt certain Jack would see to
it they had a chance to “fill up” as soon as they
could strike an open restaurant, of which there
should be no lack in such a wide-open city as
Los Angeles, with its sporty crowds at Hollywood.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was moving on apace, and
there cropped up fresh thrilling sights every little
while, for Perk to stare at through his useful
glasses. They were following the course of
the famous Gila River toward its confluence
with the still better known Colorado, which
hundreds of miles further north passed through
the Grand Canyon country, most majestic in a
panorama sense of any region on the face of the
globe.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along about nightfall they might expect to
pass over Yuma, located close to the junction of
the two rivers. Perk wondered once or twice
why his pal had not decided to land there, and
turn the prisoner over to some one in authority;
but he felt certain Jack had good reasons for
not attempting this.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe, now,” Perk told himself, with Jack
again running the ship, while he attended to
some of his own manifold duties; “he
guessed there might be a bad crowd at Yuma—fellers
apt to be in cahoots with the same
gang o’ daredevils Simeon here was connected
with; and who might even try to effect his escape,
so as to shut his trap—even go so far as to
knife the poor skunk to make sure he didn’t
peach. Oh! yeah, that’s the way Jack looked
at it, bet your boots it must be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Soon afterwards the sun gave notice that it
was about to withdraw behind the line of mountains
lying toward the west. Jack had his bearings,
and expected to be able to pick up the flash
beacons arranged for the convenience of the air
mail corps in their night flights to and from Los
Angeles. So thoroughly has this all been
mapped out, with the signals to be found about
every ten miles, that a pilot can see as many as
three ahead at one time, depending on the altitude
at which he may be flying.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such wise precautions had been taken that
would make night flying just as safe and easy as
during the daytime one thing only cropping up
from time to time to raise trouble, and cause delay
was the presence of the fogs that were apt
to rise from the deep canyons, to blot out those
friendly gleams of flashing light marking the
air mail course from start to finish.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch24' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIV <br /> <br />SIMEON GROWS DESPERATE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was commencing to grow dusk when they
sighted the lights of Yuma, that town on the railroad
leading to Los Angeles. Such a thing as a
plane flying overhead was so common these modern
days as to hardly excite any comment—they
came and went, with seldom anything out of the
usual taking place although not so very far
away, among the mountains, one of the most
dreadful of all air tragedies known to the annals
of flying had taken place, when the great
liner <i>City of San Francisco</i>, lost in a storm,
struck head-on against a rocky cliff, shattering
the ship and causing the death of every one of
those aboard, some seven souls in all.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now they had left Yuma far in their rear, and
Jack was watching to pick up the first flash beacon
on the way to the Coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>The weather continued to favor them, the
heavens being almost devoid of any semblance of
clouds, and the air quite cool at the height they
maintained while heading into the beckoning
west.</p>

<p class='c013'>Over deserts and mountainous stretches they
kept swinging along, to the constant accompaniment
of the customary chorus of a bustling plane
threading the mighty air lanes of the skies. The
silvery stars came out in battalions to sprinkle
the azure heavens like innumerable bright lanterns,
such as could be seen in Old Japan during
carnival times.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was the life, Perk told himself again and
again, sitting there after he had munched his
scanty portion of their meagre supper, Simeon
having again declined to share with them—what
air pilot who has tasted of the joys of such hours
could ever dream of forsaking his vocation, so
long as Fortune allowed him to retain his vision,
hearing, and the faculty for guiding an onrushing
ship through the realms of unlimited space—not
he for one, Perk assured himself, drawing in
huge draughts of the clear air, and watching the
wonderful beacons as they passed them by,
threading the pathway of the stars as it were,
straight toward their distant goal.</p>

<p class='c013'>The night wore on, with the voyagers making
splendid progress.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had made no miscalculation when saying
he believed they would fetch up at their destination
somewhere about the midnight hour; for
it still lacked more or less of that time when in
the near distance they glimpsed lights telling
that the city, and its nearby aviation field, must
be close at hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they found themselves circling over the
port, which, just as Jack had fancied would be
the case, was lighted most brilliantly. Even as
they sighted the field they noted a ship settling
down, evidently an air mail plane that had
been held up by some dense fog belt which they
had fortunately missed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Soft snap I’d call it, droppin’ down with all
them field lights to show the ground, so a feller
c’n see a rock the size o’ a baseball,” was what
the tickled Perk was telling himself while Jack
was proceeding to make the terminal drop, with
several ground attendants hurrying up so as to
lend any assistance needed.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had received his instructions from Jack,
and removed the handcuffs from the wrists of
the prisoner. There was no necessity for letting
everybody know the facts and the sight of a
man wearing steel bracelets, and gripped by an
attendant never fails to excite keen curiosity with
most people and especially would this be the
case if he had just come by the air route from
some unknown and therefore mysterious quarter.</p>

<p class='c013'>He would keep his arm through that of
Simeon, and inform him in a forcible whisper
that should he attempt any “funny business” it
would be at the risk of being shot down without
further warning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack would attend to everything necessary,
such as having their crate stowed away in some
convenient hangar, where it could be recovered
at any time, by paying such charges as were
customary.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be sure Perk was questioned by several of
the men while Jack saw that the ship was being
taken care of but when he chose, Perk could keep
a still tongue in his head and since he paid no
attention to what was said, and never opened his
mouth in the least, possibly they concluded he
must be both deaf and dumb.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk may have chuckled deep down in his
throat when he heard a few of the disgusted
remarks some of the men exchanged concerning
his lack of speech and hearing but
he kept his own counsel; and in the end Jack
came up saying he had secured a taxi to carry
them to a small hotel down in the heart of the
city, recommended by one of the hostlers who
seemed to know what he was talking about.</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon had looked a bit anxious, as though
wondering how their arrival at Los Angeles
would affect his wretched fortunes but he made
no attempt to appeal to the crowd for help.
Undoubtedly he was firmly convinced that the
grim Perk must be a man of his word, and that
any attempt on his part to break away would
prove a most serious matter indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah!” Perk was telling himself under his
breath when he took note of this humble disposition
on the part of Simeon, “Guess now he feels
it’s a heap better to be a live fool than a dead
hero; an’ by jinks I don’t blame the beggar for
thinkin’ thataways either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon all three safely lodged in the
taxi—which fortunately had remained up to this
late hour, the driver hoping to pick up a fare—and
heading for the nearby city.</p>

<p class='c013'>Later on they entered the small hotel, and
found it all the obliging ground attache at the
port had said. Jack registered the party, all of
them under fictitious names, since it paid to exercise
due caution when on the track of big game
just as it would for the big game hunter to make
no sound when advancing upon an enormous
tusker or “rogue” elephant whose spoor he had
been trailing through forest and jungle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Would it be possible for us to have some
supper sent up to our room?” Jack asked the
night clerk who shrugged his shoulders as if
dubious concerning his ability to accommodate
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kindly try to have it done, if double price
will have any effect,” continued Jack, using his
most gracious smile that usually accomplished
his purpose and at that the clerk responded by
saying he would do his best but it was of course
most unusual, and he hoped they would not make
any complaint if the variety was not all they
might wish.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quantity is the chief thing that interests
us,” said Jack; “you see, we have come
by air, and fell short of food while on our way,
so that my two pals here are very near being
starved; so whatever you send make it a fairly
bountiful spread, please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they were shown to their room, which
contained a double bed and a cot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I kinder guess now, partner,” said Perk, after
flashing a glance around the apartment, fronting
on a back lot, though up in the third story of the
building, “you an’ me better share the bed, while
Simeon gets his little nap on the sofy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That goes, Perk,” his comrade told him
“and after we’ve had supper we’ll hit the hay.
After such a broken night as we had back a ways
some sleep ought to be welcome, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! hope we don’t have to wait too tarnel
long for the grub,” Perk was saying, dismally
rubbing his stomach, as if to show how flat it
seemed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack engaged him in conversation of a general
character, just to keep his mind from dwelling
on the subject of eating for once Perk let himself
believe he was in danger of famishing and
he just could not subside but must commence
to marshal all the known dishes of which he was
especially fond, and keep on taunting and tantalizing
himself by stringing them off as might a
glib-tongued waiter in any restaurant.</p>

<p class='c013'>After quite a tiresome wait there was a knock
at the door, which Perk hastened to answer.
Two waiters strode in, bearing trays laden
with a pretty substantial assortment of food—quite
a satisfactory display, Jack thought, considering
the late hour, and that probably the regular
kitchen force must have long ago turned in
or else gone home.</p>

<p class='c013'>The table fairly groaned under the assortment—Perk
pertinently mentioned the fact,
adding that he guessed he’d do his share of
groaning <i>after</i> he had finished his supper which
Jack did not doubt in the least, having a knowledge
concerning the other’s vast appetite, and
unbridled disposition to make a pig of himself
at such times when food was plentiful.</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon Hawkins was coaxed to sit down with
them and as his state of mind seemed to have
improved quite a little, he also partook of food
of which he most certainly was much in need,
having fasted so long and abstemiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>When this ceremony had been carried through
to a finish, the supply of visible victuals had been
wonderfully reduced; and even Perk was heard
to declare he could not eat another bite, which
meant he was like a stuffed turkey, fit for the
Thanksgiving table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before turning in, Perk took occasion to “talk
like a Dutch uncle,” as he termed it, to Simeon,
assuring him he need not be in too upset a state
of mind concerning his future, since Jack had
said he was bound to do all he could to have him
let go, because of what he had confided to them,
and such assistance he would be able to lend the
Government in convicting the head men of the
lawless conspiracy along the counterfeiting line.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other nodded his head as though he
understood that, having embarked in the game
of throwing down Slippery Slim, he realized
there was nothing else for him to do but go
through to the windup.</p>

<p class='c013'>So confiding Perk, thinking things would run
smoothly, took off some of his outer garments,
and rolled into bed, as it afterwards turned out,
happily choosing that side of the same nearest
to the windows of their room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack soon followed, and the last thing he noticed
ere snapping off the light was the humbled
Simeon wrapped in a blanket, and lying there
flat on his back, as though meaning to get what
sleep he could during that fragment of the night
still remaining.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was, so far as appearances went, sound
asleep; but then sometimes things are not just
what they seem. To tell the truth, Perk had
made up his mind ere lying down that he would
“sleep with one eye open,” as he called it, meaning
it was his intention to keep on the alert, ready
to jump out of bed at the least sign of trouble.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps when he thus decided it was with a
hazy idea they might have some sort of unwelcome
visitor during the night; he could not just
decide how this could be but then those unprincipled
agents of the counterfeiter king—like
the fellow who had rifled the belongings of
Scotty, the air mail pilot in Atlanta—were liable
to turn up anywhere, everywhere, when least expected,
and try to manipulate their bold games.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hearing some sort of sound as of a person
moving, Perk suddenly sat straight up in bed,
to see their prisoner in the act of crawling over
the sill of the nearby window, evidently bent on
giving them the slip!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch25' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXV <br /> <br />THE STAGE SET FOR BATTLE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Hey! you, lay off that stuff!” was the way
Perk exploded, even as he made a wild dash
across the floor, and clutched the reckless Simeon
by the arm, dragging him back into the room
by sheer strength.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other struggled but feebly perhaps he
was really horrified at the desperate chances he
had been about to take.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, you must be goofy, Hawkins, to try that
sort o’ game!” Perk went on scornfully,
as the wretched man writhed on the floor where
he had flung him. “Don’t you know it’s two
stories down to the roof o’ that extension; an’
chances are you’d a got a broken neck, or leg,
in the drop. Better make up your mind to take
the medicine an’ stand it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack of course had been aroused at the first
movement of his chum, and sat up in bed watching
the actions of the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Trying to take leg bail, was he, Perk?” he
remarked. “You can hardly blame the poor
dick, come to think of it because he’s rubbing
up against a tough proposition. Better put the
bracelets on him again, and tie his ankles together
he might get loco, and try to jump out
of a window, just to end it all and that would
be too bad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon, utterly cowed and silent, made no resistance
when Perk followed out his pal’s advice.
There were several hours of the night still remaining,
and they might as well secure such
sleep as lay in their power, since no one could
predict what sort of strenuous activity awaited
them in the near future.</p>

<p class='c013'>Came morning, and the two air detectives
were stirring.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another right fine mornin’ for us,” Perk remarked,
blithely, as he looked out of the window,
and made a grimace at seeing what a nasty
drop had awaited the desperate prisoner had he
succeeded in carrying out his plan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! that’s the usual program, I understand,
out here on the Coast,” Jack told him. “Hardly
ever see any rain in this blessed country; that’s
why they have to depend on irrigation for their
crops.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Plenty to keep us hoppin’ today, I kinder
guess, partner, eh, what?” volunteered Perk, as
he started dressing, after removing the stout
cords that had been wrapped about the lower
limbs of the Federal prisoner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never said truer words, boy,” Jack
added “got to settle about this business of having
our friend here held until the gate’s been
crashed, and our scoop put through. Then I
mean to have a good talk with several people in
the Government offices, who can give us a few
points that so far we’ve been missing. You can’t
pick up too much information when aiming to
stack up against smart lads like this Slippery
Slim. He’s got so many eyes on the watch the
chap who expects to corral <i>him</i> must get up right
early in the morning, and pull the wires in a
dozen different directions. I’d a heap rather
overdo the matter of taking precautions than to
let just one ragged end get loose, for a game like
this is only as strong as its weakest link.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do we eat here, or look up a restaurant?”
asked Perk, quite naturally, since it was the
easiest thing in the world for his thoughts to
turn toward the subject of catering to the loud
demands of his stomach, when the usual time
for meals came around.</p>

<p class='c013'>“On the whole I reckon it’d be as well for us
to stick around, and have breakfast fetched up
here,” suggested jack. “I’ll step down presently,
and see if it can be managed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just as you say, partner,” Perk told him,
grinning, to add: “Make her two fried eggs and
a rasher o’ bacon for me; also a big cup o’ coffee
with a stack o’ wheats done brown. Say, you
might add some toast, and an orange, seein’ that
this is California, an’ a feller ought to patronize
the fruit industry when happenin’ to visit the
Coast country. Guess that ought to fill a vacuum
okay, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Leave it to me, Perk, and you’ll never starve
to death I’m a good provider, and Uncle Sam
foots the chuck wagon bill.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When later on two waiters appeared laden
down with a mass of dishes, Perk grinned some
more, and looked quite joyous; for the odor of
coffee and bacon always pleased his sense of smell
as nothing else could.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Simeon had apparently about decided to
make the best of a bad bargain, for he began
sniffing as though the idea of breakfast appealed
to him—he certainly needed something to brace
him up.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along about ten o’clock they prepared to set
out for the offices of the Federal forces in Los
Angeles. Simeon had finally given his word not
to make any further attempt at escape. Jack had
been talking seriously with the fellow ever since
breakfast, trying to squeeze further information
from him, and holding out hope that if he “came
clean” he might yet be allowed to go back to his
family after the Government had made use of
him to send the leaders in the wide flung conspiracy
to prison for long terms.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again a convenient taxi was called upon to
convey the trio to their intended destination.
Both Jack and Perk evinced considerable curiosity
concerning the unfamiliar sights on the
streets. They asked numerous questions of the
driver, who chanced to be a communicative sort
of fellow, and filled them up with information
about the sunny queen city of the Coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not long before Jack’s magical passport,
sanctioned by the Big Boss at Washington,
brought them in contact with several high officials
who apparently had been secretly apprized
of their presence in the West, and had
also been requested to afford the two daring sky
detectives all the assistance possible in carrying
out their plan of campaign.</p>

<p class='c013'>So it came about that Simeon was taken off
their hands, after the story of his capture had
been told. Jack secured a promise that the man
would be lightly dealt with because of the valuable
aid he had already afforded the sleuth-hounds
of the air branch of the Law.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both of them shook hands with the pitiful
looking chap as he was taken away by a marshal
who had been summoned and who would see
that he was kept aloof from all other prisoners
until his testimony was wanted in court.</p>

<p class='c013'>After that they fell into a general talk, Jack
telling the deeply interested officials about the
stirring adventures befalling himself and Perk
since they first struck Atlanta, where the drive
really had its beginning.</p>

<p class='c013'>In return he was given such information as
had been gathered in connection with more recent
happenings along the line of Slippery Slim’s
operations and the fact of the matter was there
always seemed to be fresh outbreaks of the bogus
money disease in this or that part of the whole
Southwest, as new agents started to work virgin
territory until by this time the greatest unrest
and uneasiness existed among all Government
ranks.</p>

<p class='c013'>The balance of that day the two pals put in
taking a look around the city, visiting Hollywood,
and seeing a number of movie stars whom
they recognized from familiarity with their faces
on the silver screen at various times.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack paid another visit to Federal Headquarters
on the succeeding day, to gather up all
loose ends, and decide on his plans while Perk
took himself off to look up some old friend, who,
he understood, was making good in one of the
new big pictures.</p>

<p class='c013'>They met again late in the afternoon, with
Perk displaying signs of nervous tension for
almost the first thing he said to his chum was in
the shape of a leading question, which Jack undoubtedly
anticipated, knowing Perk’s headlong
nature as he did, and the habit of the other for
seeking speedy action.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wal, what’s the good word, old hoss—when
do we skip out from here, if so be it’s all set?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No more hanging fire, brother,” Jack assured
him, smilingly “we’re loaded for bear this time,
sure pop. I’ve been out at the airport, and had
a full tank of gas put aboard the crate as well
as all that stuff you sent over so’s to keep us from,
starving to death.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bully boy!” crowed the delighted Perk; “jest
can’t come any too soon to please me. I’m only
cravin’ a chanct for a set-to with the head o’ this
flim-flam bunch, who’s laughed at the Government
boys just once too often. Is it tonight,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Midnight ought to see us several hundred
miles on our way, if all goes well,” Jack told
him, not displaying any outward signs of jubilation
himself, although he undoubtedly must be
thrilled by the thought of how they were now
about to put everything to the test, and match
their wits against that astute schemer, for whom
the Federal prison doors were yawning so widely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never gimme sweeter words, old pal!”
Perk was saying, backed up by one of his most
hideous grins.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch26' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVI <br /> <br />ON THE FACE OF THE MOON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Jack proved as good as his word, for they were
off shortly after nightfall, and headed almost
due east. No one at the aviation field had the
remotest idea as to who they were, what their
destination might be, and whence they came.
But then this particular port was becoming a
very important link in the trans-continental
chain, with lines of great passenger and freight
airships going and coming not to mention the
several speedy air mail boats that covered their
hundreds of miles day or night and as a rule on a
schedule that seemed as perfect as that of any
train time table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was unusually silent, at least for him.
Perhaps he was realizing at last the serious
nature of the job they had undertaken—that it
was rather a weighty proposition, such as was
bound to require all their united reserve force
to put across.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still, he had absolute confidence in Jack’s
ability to swing the undertaking, and also refused
to allow anything like doubt to assail him
with regard to their united courage.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was by this time well understood that the
climax, when it came, would occur on Mexican
soil for now that all accounts from every quarter
were in hand, they knew absolutely that the den
of the counterfeiting gang was in a secret cave
among the mountains of Sonora also that the
sagacious Slim had bought protection from certain
local Mexican officials, who were suspected
of secretly plotting a new revolution, and took
this means for obtaining the money needed to
purchase arms in the States.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was even said that Slim never flew back to
his headquarters without loading his swift plane
with a dead weight of guns and ammunition as
the price he had to pay for being allowed to operate
undisturbed on foreign soil.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A pretty kettle of fish, I’d call that sort o’
game,” Perk had indignantly asserted, when he
learned of this see-saw method of currying favor
with the plotting generals who hoped to once
again turn the country upside-down and kick
the present rulers out of office, as well as seize
the city banks with their rich booty.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so it was, but Jack realized how it accounted
for the long spell of immunity Slim had
enjoyed while he lined his pockets, and spread
that financial panic throughout the Southwestern
States. There never had been his equal as a skillful
worker and bold lawbreaker; one who knew
how to set neighbor against neighbor, and make
every one work so that he could rake off a heavy
dividend from each separate deal.</p>

<p class='c013'>So he had for a long time been coming and
going, crossing the border, as a rule by the air
route, carrying his cargoes of deceitful bank bills
to various distributing points—like the one Jack
and Perk had struck by sheer accident—gathering
the genuine stuff contributed by his numerous
dupes, and leaving bulky packages of the wonderfully
executed spurious notes in exchange.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a veritable Golconda for the industrious
worker, who, safe from interference, had kept
as busy as the proverbial bee, that stores honey
day after day.</p>

<p class='c013'>They followed the line of swirling beacons
the air mail boys were in the habit of trailing,
since by this means they could pass some of the
numerous danger spots on their route. In good
time Jack expected to turn his back on these
friendly flashing lights and head due south, to
cross the border, and fly over foreign territory.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had been placed in possession of certain
secret documents issued by the Mexican government,
which proved how they knew of the unholy
alliance made between Slim, the counterfeiter
king, and those traitorous generals who yearned
for fresh outbreaks so as to pamper their own
personal fortunes, just then at low ebb.</p>

<p class='c013'>There existed something of an arrangement,
whereby the Mexican government agreed to
stand back of any effort made by the Department
at Washington to capture Slim, smash his gang
that was widening its powers every day, and
clean out the mess of near-bandits with whom he
had allied himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>If it were necessary all arrangements had been
made whereby Colonel Jose Morales, with a
crack regiment of hard fighting regulars who
had seen much bloody service in bringing the
defiant Yaqui Indians to terms by invading their
mountain fastnesses, and meeting them hand-to-hand—was
stationed within a day’s ride of the
ravine where Slim had his plant and could be
summoned by means of certain smoke signals.
No sooner would these “talking smokes” be detected
than the order would be given “boots and
saddles,” with the mounted regiment in full
swing for the debatable ground where Slim had
his nefarious nest.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, too, had a secret arrangement been effected
with the old leader of the now defunct Texas
Rangers, most of whom were in the service of the
Government connected with the border patrol
and orders had been given the former gallant
hero that if a certain message were received, no
matter by what method, he was to gather a squad
of his old fighters, and cross the border, sure of
being warmly received by the loyal Mexican
troops who would welcome his assistance in wiping
out the sore spot that had been so long a blot
on their country’s honor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus it would seem that everything possible
had been done toward striking a telling blow.
It only remained for Jack Ralston to start the
ball rolling, when it must gain fresh impetus
with every revolution.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk acted as though decidedly pleased when
later on he discovered that they no longer followed
the flashing beacon trail—Jack had gone
as far as was judicious along that line and now
headed straight into the mysterious south, toward
the border of the neighboring republic where
disorder still held sway, and disgruntled chiefs
continued to plot against the rule of the recently
elected president.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every mile traversed now was bringing them
closer to their goal, and Perk found more or less
joy in picturing the thrilling climax, when they
would give Slippery Slim the surprise of his
life—if only no leak concerning their clever plan
had come about.</p>

<p class='c013'>The moon had risen, and was hanging there
in the east, a silvery shield with one edge clipped
off telling that the queen of the night was already
well past her “full” stage and running for
a fall.</p>

<p class='c013'>All at once Perk had an electric shock.</p>

<p class='c013'>He leaned convulsively forward and gripped
his mate by the shoulder, at the same time pointing
toward the southeast and shouting through
the head phones:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look, oh look—see what’s passing across the
moon, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then just as suddenly did he release his clutch,
to fall back in his seat, and exclaim most dramatically,
with a touch of disgust in his voice:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! It’s slipped past, dang the luck!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But I got it all right, Perk,” the pilot assured
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it <i>was</i> a ship, an’ my lamps didn’t fool
me, partner?” Perk cried in renewed excitement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As sure as you’re born, that’s what it was,
brother,” Jack added.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Headin’ south, same as we’re doin’ right now,
eh, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, buddy—just what the crate was
doing, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the answer—could it a been <i>him</i>, on
his way back home with a load o’ machine guns,
life they say he carries every time he crosses the
border, after takin’ out a freshly printed batch
o’ his flimsy stuff to soak on the honest folks back
home?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s something we can only make a stab
at,” replied Jack. “Chances lean that, way, I
must say; but just the same it might have been
some mail plane that’s got blown off its regular
course, and is beating it for the home port. Then
again I understand the border patrol are handling
a few ships in their line of intercepting flyers
making a business of smuggling Chinese aliens
across the line night-times.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d give a heap to know the answer to that
puzzle,” continued Perk, who disliked enigmas,
and all that sort of thing calculated to make a
fellow lie awake nights, bothering his poor
brains. He never had been fitted by Nature for
the job of being a real detective.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll never know,” his pal told him, “unless
it happens we run afoul of the other crate when
our courses draw closer together and if it’s Slim
whose fingers grip that stick we’d rather be excused
for having that happen—our job is to fetch
him back <i>alive</i>, and not make him lose his life
in a crash.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me, I ain’t peticular just what <i>does</i> happen
to the slick guy,” Perk wound up the little talkfest
by saying. “Only, when it comes to a real
showdown either Slim or us got to go to the
wall—dead or alive, the thing’s goin’ to be settled
for keeps!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch27' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVII <br /> <br />THE SIERRA MADRE CHAIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Another thing Perk noticed—this was the fact
that Jack seemed to have changed his mind with
regard to making haste for the ship was racing
along at top-notch speed, as though engaged
in a race with some unseen rival.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hey! what’s the big idea, Jack?” he called
out, when this thing had been going on for some
time, and his burning curiosity could no longer
be held in leash. “Why doin’ the sprintin’ act,
I’m awonderin’?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Less chance for us to run foul of that other
boat if we forge well ahead, don’t you see, partner?”
exclaimed the pilot, sententiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! that’s a fact,” returned the enlightened
Perk. “An’ then mebbe it’d be jest as well for us
to get there ahead o’ the boss in the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m aiming to do that,” he was told.
“It happens that we can’t keep on in the boat till
we strike close to his hideout—the racket would
stir the whole bunch up like a hornet’s nest you’ve
kicked when going through the brush, with the
mad critters swarming out to tackle you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you now, Big Boss—never did think
o’ that before. Then I kinder guess we’ll
have to hike some little way,” and there was a
vein of chagrin in the speaker’s voice as he mentioned
this fact, since walking and Perk never
did seem to agree very well—like most flyers he
had been spoiled for all manner of pedestrianism
by his ability to cover such vast distances
without moving his pedal extremities an iota.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s our sure enough program,” Jack told
him, doubtless thinking that the delayed knowledge
might allow his pal to make up his mind
about swallowing the bitter medicine without a
single grimace.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not long after this little break when
Jack again spoke:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve a good idea we’re across the line now,
partner,” was the information he passed along.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sounds good to me, okay,” commented Perk,
with a tinge of solid satisfaction visible in his
voice as though having a possible rough-house
job to handle, the sooner he got busy the sooner
it was likely to be over.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And making more than an even hundred
miles to the hour in the bargain, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some punkins about comin’ in swell on the
last lap, this crate sure is, I’d say, partner.
Licketty split she humps along like a reg’lar
witch. I guess now she’d make rings around
that ol’ boat Slim’s got hold o’ though it
answers his purpose seems like. But see here,
Jack, you never did tell me jest how you got word
to that same Colonel Morales down here in
Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was given my instructions, and sent a telegram
to him at Hermosilla, in care of Padre
Lopez, giving him the order he was expecting—during
the last hour we were in Los Angeles.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! then the sojers must be in the saddle
right now!” burst out Perk, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If the arrangement went through without a
miss that’s like enough a fact,” admitted Jack;
“the way my plan’s arranged everything must go
off with the regularity of machine work, each
separate part dovetailing, so as to work in full
sympathy. If anything lags, and goes amiss, it’s
apt to throw the whole scheme out of gear, you
understand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! I grab what you mean, partner,” said
the astounded Perk; “but I got to hand it to you
when it comes to hatchin’ up big things—it’s jest
wonderful how you manage. An’ I sure do hope
everything’ll slide along like greased lightnin’,
once it gets started.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had planned to drop down in some isolated
spot where with the coming of dawn, with
the aid of the strong glasses they could pick up
the rocky Sierra Madre range with its canyons
and valleys, where, unless all his leads have been
false clues, those whom they sought would have
their secret den and stronghold.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk got to thinking these matters over, and of
course he was bound to run across some things
that still seemed a bit hazy in his mind. Accordingly
he sought for information at headquarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, now, d’ye know I’m jest beginnin’ to get
on to why you had the wings an’ fuselage o’ this
here ship painted the color o’ sand—took a pattern
from the way they striped the steamers on
the Atlantic durin’ the big war, an’ colored batteries
on the battle front, so flyers couldn’t pick
’em out to drop their bombs down on—camouflage,
ain’t that the right word, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Slow to get on to my little schemes, partner;
but in the end you make a smart stab—yes, that
was what I had in mind, for I knew we’d have
to park the old bus somewhere in the open; and
I didn’t want any hostile eye to glimpse her from
a soaring plane, or a mountain crag—for you see
I reckoned Slim was too smart a lad not to have
binoculars handy so as to watch for trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>More than ever was Perk impressed with an
overwhelming admiration for the ability of his
pal to lay plans capable of covering every possible
necessity that could arise in carrying out
the job they had tackled.</p>

<p class='c013'>He asked no more questions, confident that
everything was bound to move along smoothly,
when the casting of the play was in such capable
hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Anyway,” he told himself as he thus pondered,
“we ain’t seen anything more o’ that moon
ship, which makes it certain we’ve knocked her
outen the runnin’. Wonder now if that was really
an’ truly ol’ Slim, totin’ a swell bunch o’ machine
guns, so’s to bolster up the new revolution
they say is bein’ fostered an’ nursed in this corner
o’ poor ol’ Mexico. Queer what international
jingles a feller c’n get mixed up in, when he runs
in harness with Uncle Sam’s revenue boys; but
it’s all pie to me, just the same, ’cause they allers
did say my middle name was Scrap.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was now starting to make use of the binoculars,
which were fitted with lens capable of
making them useful during the night-time, at
least when there was a certain amount of moonlight.
In a general way Perk could decide where
to turn his attention, for it went without saying
that the mountain chain lay toward the southeast
for had he not studied the lay of the land
upon the small but accurate map with which
Jack had armed himself before leaving Washington
to take up this hazardous adventure?</p>

<p class='c013'>When he felt assured that he could make out
the distant ridges he announced his pleasing discovery
to his mate and then at the other’s request
took over the controls so that Jack in turn might
use the glasses and thus make assurance doubly
safe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bank, and head more into the east,” Perk
heard the other saying, after a steady look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it’s the Sierra Madre okay, partner, I
opine?” suggested the one at the stick, as he
obeyed orders.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question about it,” Jack assured him “but
I knew it was time for us to sight the ridge. I’ve
pored over the map of this section, and charted
it all out in blocks, so I can tell just what the lay
of the land is, and how long it’s apt to take the
colonel to get here with his galloping company.
We’re going to drop down presently, and find
shelter where we can lie low until the hour comes
for making our ten strike.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How long might that be, boss?” asked Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It all depends on certain happenings. We
can creep up close to the place, and watch how
things move figuring out how to act when you
get your first glimpse of a dust cloud away off
toward where Hermosilla lies. I give the cavalry
two days to reach here, if everything moves along
smoothly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Two long days—an’ say, we gotter eat all that
time, don’t we, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We surely can’t live on air, Perk; but I’ve
provided for that—even should we run out of
grub you laid in I’ve a little deposit of dried
meat, real pemmican in fact, that will keep us
from famishing. Water we can secure somewhere
among the mountain trails, since never a
drop would we be apt to find on the open desert.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! I’m leavin’ it all to you, Big Boss,”
Perk told him, again lost in wonder and near
awe as he realized how Jack seemed to have
thought of everything—what a mind the boy had
for grasping details, and weaving them into the
net with which they expected to enmesh the slippery
one.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now Jack slowed down their speed more or
less, although of course it was not possible to
soften the clamor accompanying their flight
through space. But Perk noticed that, so far as
he could tell, the night wind was coming from
ahead, and this assured him it would not be apt
to carry those telltale sounds toward the range
lying in the east, and so warn the enemy of their
coming.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch28' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVIII <br /> <br />CLOSE TO THE TIGER’S LAIR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“We’re about due for a landing, Perk,” finally
announced the pilot, after he had used the glasses
for a spell, and again took over the stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! some hike that’s agoin’ to be, I’d say,
old hoss,” grunted Perk; “but I guess it can’t
be helped—got to take the bitter with the sweet
lots o’ times—the way o’ the world, seems like.
Go to it then, boss; if anybody c’n make a safe
landin’ by moonlight it’s jest you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>His confidence was not misplaced, as Jack
proved when he brought the ship down in as
perfect a three-point drop as the best of aces
could have carried out.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’ll have to lie here till we need her again,”
he observed, on climbing out of his confined
quarters, and stretching his cramped legs after
the manner of air mail pilots in from a long and
irksome run.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk stared around him—they were on the
sandy desert without a doubt, and off toward the
east could be seen the dim crests of the high and
ragged peaks comprising the main ridges of the
Sierra Madres—old-time home of the fierce
Yaqui Indians, whom the soldiers of Mexico had
for so many years labored so hard and in vain
to conquer; nor was it until the day the airplane
came along that they were able to accomplish
this much to be desired end.</p>

<p class='c013'>But now other equally annoying thorns in the
flesh had made a hideout of those same
inaccessible mountains—defeated aspirants for
the presidency of the Republic, always generals,
took to gathering groups of malcontents and mercenary
adventurers in these mountain depths,
defying the troops sent to rout them out, and
proving the latest source of trouble in the political
problems of the authorities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack soon completed his preparations for
abandoning their ship. He looked it all over, to
satisfy himself its camouflage would prevent it
from being sighted by any air pilot chancing to
pass overhead at a reasonable altitude then he
gathered a few articles, the possession of which
might turn out to be of value when it came to
closing the mouth of the bag and finally announced
himself as ready to make a move.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got all you wanted, Perk?” he inquired, incidentally,
for he had reason to feel certain such
was the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! from the binoculars an’ my rifle, down
to what’s left o’ the eats,” the other assured him.
“Guess we’ll get along somehow or other.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! don’t bother your head about the grub
part, comrade; I’m carrying a small packet with
me that holds enough to keep two men alive for
a whole week—all we’ll have to do is to run
across some sort of spring, where we can get all
the drinking water we’ll need, while we wait for
the wagon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! in this case you’re meanin’ a <i>hearse</i>,
’cause mebbe we’ll have to shoot him up afore he
calls quits,” and Perk grinned horribly at his
own wit.</p>

<p class='c013'>So they left the ship stranded there, sprawled
out like a gigantic dragon-fly or a monstrous
toad. If Fortune proved kind they might yet
live to make good use of it again when the time
came to fly back to God’s country on the other
side of the border where defeated candidates
are in the habit of accepting the dictum of the
voters, and retiring from the field of battle await
the next call to arms, with ballots instead of
bullets as their method of settling elections.</p>

<p class='c013'>Side by side they set forth, like a pair of adventurers
starting out in search of Fortune’s
smiles, and careless alike as to whether they met
with success or not, so long as the excitement
they craved came their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk managed to conceal the chagrin with
which he buckled down to his unwelcome task,
walking always gave him a pain, mental rather
than physical but on the whole he was a good
scout, and could follow the beckoning finger of
duty, even though he loathed the conditions attached
to the performance of his role.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sand was far from compact, and allowed
them to sink in somewhat, so this made the going
more difficult in contrast to that on the seashore
which being beaten down by incoming waves is
often as hard as concrete and a pleasure to walk
over; whereas this of the desert was dry and
sifted at the least puff of wind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk having had some previous experience
with deserts, felt no love for the uninviting waste
places of the earth only such useless vegetation
as sage, greasewood, cactus and yucca would
grow between the sand dunes amidst the blistering
fangs of the infernal heat and always vowed
he disliked such arid regions with a violence too
deep for mere words.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet he kept his own counsel and plodded away
alongside his pal as if he had no personal feelings
in the matter whatsoever. Far off in front
of them they could see the line of peaks studded
against the sky once or twice Perk felt certain
he had caught a fluttering light aloft such as
might spring from a passing plane but in every
instance he finally decided it must be some shooting
star, ducking behind the mountain range,
leaving a trailing wake behind that but reflected
its passing glory.</p>

<p class='c013'>One hour, two, and then a third dragged along
before Jack thought fit to call a halt. Never did
poor weary footsore Perk, almost used up, listen
to more welcome and delightful words than
when Jack as he drew to a halt went on to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Time to rest, partner, you know—I’d like to
find a bunch of shady trees that would afford us
a decent shelter from the blazing sun, should we
be so unfortunate as to get adrift after leaving
all landmarks behind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! bless you for sayin’ that, buddy,” Perk
was saying hoarsely, for his throat seemed as dry
as tinder, the fine sand even affecting his vocal
cords so that he would not have recognized his
own voice. “By your leave I guess I’ll lie down
and get the kinks outen my legs. Wow! that
must abeen fi’ miles if she was one—my shoes
are full o’ sand, an’ altogether I don’t feel half
the man I was on startin’ out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There are some trees over yonder, you may
notice, Perk; so after we’ve caught our second
wind we’ll take chances, and cut across to where
they lie, perhaps when morning comes tripping
along, we may climb up the face of the mountain
and get a look-in at the printing establishment
that’s set itself up in opposition to the U. S.
Treasury Department, and the Federal Bank.
Come on then, a little further where we can drop
down, and rest our weary feet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards the pair had crept in
among the sheltering trees, where Jack called a
rest, although under the impression that they
should get along further before break of day.</p>

<p class='c013'>He talked matters over with his partner, speaking
almost in whispers, since in this enemy country
no one could take anything for granted and
for all they knew hostile ears might chance to
be close by, ready to listen in.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Perk himself who proposed to move
along while the going was good.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like we might be a heap better off, old
hoss, if on’y we located up thar on the side o’ the
mountain, where we could see without our bein’
watched. I’m okay now, an’ ready for b’ar.”</p>

<p class='c013'>That was the spirit Jack liked in his mate—a
readiness to take hold and reach a decision. They
moved along toward the base of the forbidding
height, keeping a watchful eye on the eastern
sky lest dawn come and surprise them in the
open, where it would not be easy to find a hiding
place during the entire day.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fortune favored them, for they managed to
get under cover before the first gray streaks appeared
in the east. It was bound to be a strenuous
task climbing that formidable mountain side
but Jack had prepared for even this part of the
adventure.</p>

<p class='c013'>From various sources he had learned how there
were three separate means for subduing that
grim pyramid of rocks and trees and tangled
growth—in order to lessen the chances of discovery,
with unpleasant consequences, Jack had
decided to try and negotiate the most difficult
of these mountain trails in the belief that it
would offer a safer passage since evidently none
of the seething revolutionists, or their allies, the
bad men from across the border, would be likely
to follow that canyon trail when others less difficult
could be utilized.</p>

<p class='c013'>Down there hidden by the bushes and spurs
of outlying rock they employed their time in
munching what must serve as their breakfast.
Then quenching their thirst at a convenient
pool they proceeded to climb the face of
the steep elevation, making for the quaint hollow
in the crater of a long dead volcano and which
had once been a Yaqui fort.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch29' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIX <br /> <br />NEARING THE GOAL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>They had now reached that most thrilling
point in their bold venture, where they would
have to “watch their steps” most carefully, lest
an incautious act precipitate a calamity that must
end all their hopes as well as snuff out their
lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>This breeding place for inflammatory embers
of Mexican revolutionary disappointed political
generals, and their immediate retainers, was
about as safe for the two sky detectives as a cage
of Bengal tigers would have been once let their
presence be suspected, and the entire neighborhood
would be scratched over as with a fine-tooth
comb in the endeavor to discover their
hiding place and should they be rounded up it
needed no magician to prophesy what their fate
must be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack led the way, with Perk following at his
heels, every sense on the alert. The native cougar
of that historical group of mountains could
hardly have crept along with greater care than
did the two human sleuth hounds of the law.
Every advance was attempted only after a careful
survey of the entire neighborhood—at the
sound of some faint bird-call Jack would sink
down and flatten himself upon the ground, his
example being imitated by his shadow.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this caused their progress to be exceedingly
slow but time did not enter into their calculations
so much as security—many hours must
pass ere Jack could figure on the arrival of those
upon whom everything depended and they
might as well make use of the entire morning in
climbing higher and higher toward their ultimate
goal.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once when they chanced to be resting their
tired limbs, snug in a sheltered nook behind a
mass of brushwood, Jack turned and looked back.
The site was especially fine for looking out on
the level stretch toward the spot where they had
landed during the preceding night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, watching the actions of his comrade,
could easily give a close guess as to what Jack
had in mind. This opinion was made more convincing
when he saw the other get out the useful
binoculars, and apply them to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Keenly he kept tabs on the others and was
finally thrilled to note the pleased nod Jack gave
as if wholly satisfied.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk touched him on the arm, and as Jack
turned made motions with his head, while his
eyebrows went up, his expression without a single
word being spoken signifying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How come?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take a look for yourself, and tell me if you
can get the first glimpse of our old crate” suggested
Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ doin,” whispered Perk, after a most
diligent search; “an’ if we can’t get a whiff o’
the boat, with these glasses, I kinder guess
nobody ain’t agoin’ to locate it with their naked
eyes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which same lets us out from any danger in
that quarter,” came softly from Jack, whose face
for the moment lost some of the strained look it
had borne during the last few hours.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never saw a better sample o’ camouflage
when I was across the big pond alistenin’ to the
smash o’ the rip-roarin’ German guns,” asserted
Perk; and then “dried up” when he saw the
other press a finger on his lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>Higher they climbed, like monkeys, taking all
manner of desperate chances when necessity
arose but so cautious was Jack in leading the
way that nothing amiss came about, every obstacle
being successfully surmounted until
shortly before the noon hour they found themselves
in a position to spy upon the camp of their
intended prey.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was intensely interested in what he now
visioned. The old crater, resembling an immense
football bowl, as adopted by some Eastern
colleges, looked as though it might have proven
well nigh impregnable as a fortress where the
fighting Yaquis were able to hold an army at
bay—which feat history records as an actual fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>Scattered about the depression were scores of
rude dwellings, some built of rocks, while others
more modern had walls composed of sun-baked
bricks, known throughout all Mexico as <i>adobes</i>.
Men and women, also children, could be seen
moving about, preparing the noonday meal or
partaking of their customary frijoles, hot tamales,
or it might be maize cakes cooked in the
hot ashes of fires, and with black coffee as a
beverage.</p>

<p class='c013'>The picture appealed to Perk, who delighted
in novel scenes nor did it seem to lose any of
its thrill from the fact that, as he very well knew,
the men he was staring at so eagerly were most
likely as tough a brand of desperadoes and villains
as could be grouped together anywhere on
earth—ready to fight, hold up trains, or commit
all manner of pillage at the drop of a hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>He marveled at the sagacity shown by Slippery
Slim in deciding to join forces with these
firebrands of the back country, with the idea of
thus securing the greatest safety for his own
lawless operations.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this while Jack had been keeping close
watch, in hopes of being able to pick out the
figure of the man he had been deputized to bring
back to the States so he might be prosecuted for
his crimes, and sent to Atlanta. There he would
possibly end his days in seclusion, with a large
portion of the Southwest breathing more freely
since they need no longer fear the avalanche of
counterfeit currency that had been demoralizing
business for such a long spell.</p>

<p class='c013'>After all it was Perk who made the discovery,
he chancing to be carefully handling the binoculars
at the time. He handed the glasses over to
his mate, and told Jack just where to look, using
as few words as possible, and keeping his voice
very low.</p>

<p class='c013'>Long and earnestly did Jack follow the movements
of the remarkable character who had been
described in his hearing so many times. What
satisfaction it afforded him to know he was actually
in sight of the big game and if only his
plans carried through his hour of triumph was
steadily drawing closer and closer. In imagination,
as he continued to watch the moving figure,
he could vision the pleasure it would afford him
when he could turn in his report to his Chief,
and mark it as completed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon drifted along, and night approached.
Nothing could be done to hasten the
crisis; they must wait patiently, and continue to
shape their plans until the expected smoke signal
told them Morales and his rough riders had
reached the foot of the Sierra Madres ten miles
further south and when assured by means of a
counter signal that everything was working well,
start to cover the last lap of their long ride, leave
their mounts at a safe distance, and complete the
journey on foot.</p>

<p class='c013'>When darkness fell the picture was even more
fascinating to Perk than before, with a number
of fires lighting up the huge bowl, the sound of
women chattering in Spanish, and children playing
just as all youngsters might do while from
time to time he could catch strains of music, telling
that some amorous swain might be practicing
on his guitar, as all who have a drop of Spanish
blood in their veins invariably love to do when
at leisure.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk doubtless made many a grimace while
partaking of the light refreshment afforded by
the tough pemmican Jack had produced, as their
sole means for staying their empty stomachs for
when the evening breeze wafted some of the
odors from the cooking fires down below it almost
set him wild with a desire to partake of hot
food. But he knew what he was up against, and
sternly repressed the inclination to groan his
protest.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was one of the longest nights Perk ever
knew. The mountain air, too, was cold, especially
along toward the last few hours and since
they were debarred from the joy of indulging
in a campfire, Perk could only lie there and
shiver. He never was so glad to see the pink
sky in the east as on that occasion.</p>

<p class='c013'>The day was but a repetition of their former
afternoon with their sole recreation being the
chance it gave them to watch Slippery Slim’s
movements whenever he appeared coming out of
what seemed to be a cavern of some sort from
which at several times when the racket from many
tongues died down Perk could catch a strange
rumbling sound, accompanied by what seemed
to be a blow, and which he could easily believe
must be the working of the printing press that
had been carried all the way from the States in
order to be able to produce those wonderfully
clever notes that had deceived many shrewd
bank tellers by their deceptive qualities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then at last Jack discovered, just as night had
begun to fall, three columns of smoke rising toward
the heavens from far down the wild Sierra,
telling how that Morales and his troop had arrived,
and that the curtain was about to rise on
the last scene of the international drama.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch30' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXX <br /> <br />JACK GETS HIS MAN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Immediately on discovering the welcome signal,
Jack dispatched Perk to put a match to the
heap of brush they had arranged well out of sight
from the depression where the skeleton revolutionary
army was slowly assembling its pitiful
force of the dissatisfied generals who had been
counted out in the last national election.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk understood what was expected of him,
and managed to send up a single smoke signal,
allowing it to have but a brief life and then hastening
to smother the fire. As Morales was expected
to be on the watch for just such a sign,
he would lose little time in starting to carry out
his part in the attack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In three hours they will be climbing the
mountain by way of the old Yaqui trail we followed,”
Jack was telling his chum, when the
other returned to his side, flushed with the success
of his labors. “It is time for us to make a
forward move, so that we may be ready to strike
as soon as the camp quiets down and corral our
man, leaving it to Morales to carry the fort itself
by storm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This they set about doing without any further
delay. Dodging from rock to rock, taking advantage
of every outlying spur, as well as patches
of hardy bushes, and other objects that were
likely to conceal their movements from any
watchful eyes but always creeping downward,
they crawled along like two great lizards such,
as Perk could remember seeing when in the
Philippines.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the time they were ready to slip into the
underground pressroom of the lawless printing
company’s plant, Jack figured the three hours
had just about expired, and that it was now up to
them to make the first hostile move that would
precipitate the assault.</p>

<p class='c013'>In thus deciding to make a start he was influenced
by seeing an agreed upon signal from
the same hiding place he and Perk had held for
so many hours, and which told him the troopers
had finally succeeded in climbing to the position
assigned to them when plans for action were
formed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Flattening themselves out against the dark
wall of a small cliff Jack and Perk glided along
until they arrived at that aperture in the solid
rock they knew to be the entrance to the wonderful
underground retreat that had been described
by Simeon at the time when in his desperation
he gave his confederates away and from which
they had watched Slippery Slim come and go
during those long hours of their espionage.</p>

<p class='c013'>Slipping inside, they found themselves in a
corridor that led into the body of the mountain
with a gleam of light beckoning them to advance.
In this fashion they kept moving, gliding from
one point to another, until eventually they had a
clear view of the little machine that was working
so industriously in turning out the bogus
money, hour after hour, as though the demand
were without limit.</p>

<p class='c013'>How Perk did stare, and hold his breath when
realizing that they were upon the verge of accomplishing
their great undertaking. Slippery
Slim was doing no actual manual labor himself,
but he kept close watch over the two men who
ran the press, closely scrutinizing the printed
bills as if to detect the slightest inaccuracy, and
correct it without delay.</p>

<p class='c013'>No wonder, Jack told himself, the product of
his skill had startled the financial world by its
genuine appearance, when such a master in his
particular line took such personal pains to see
that the work was carried out in its most minute
details.</p>

<p class='c013'>In whispers Jack informed his backer what his
duty would be when the roar of guns and hoarse
shouts from without announced that the picked
troopers had actually launched their long deferred
assault. Jack had taken it upon himself
to close in on the chief worker in that little
coterie, and have the glory of capturing Slippery
Slim unaided but meanwhile Perk might find
plenty of action in holding up those two others
who were second in importance only to the leading
figure.</p>

<p class='c013'>The tension had become almost unendurable
when suddenly there broke out a frightful uproar—women
were shrieking, children’s high
pitched voices told of intense alarm; men gave
tongue, and above it all guns began to sound with
deadly import, until the basin rocked with the
dreadful clamor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack waited no longer, but giving Perk a kick
on the shins to tell him to get busy he rushed
headlong toward Slippery Slim, holding his automatic
ready for instant service, knowing as he
did that such a desperate bad man as Slim
was reckoned from all accounts, would not be
apt to surrender so long as there remained the
slightest chance for a getaway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nor was he mistaken in judging the character
of the man who had so long defied the shrewdest
detectives of the United States Secret Service
for when Slim found his way to the open air
barred by such a determined looking figure, he
snatched out his handy gat and made as if to open
fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>For once he was just a trifle too slow with his
service gun, for Jack, clever lad that he was
along the line of firing off-hand, managed to send
a bullet through Slim’s right shoulder that crippled
him, so that his own weapon went rattling
to the stone under his feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put ’em up!” Jack was saying, covering his
man as he spoke and having no desire to commit
suicide, Slippery Slim obeyed the call; and
instantly afterwards suffering the painful ignominy
of having his wrists encircled by a pair
of nice new steel bracelets.</p>

<p class='c013'>So far so good, with Jack, his own share of the
capture an accomplished fact, able to turn in
order to lend Perk a helping hand. It was not
needed, for Perk had descended on those two
muscular chaps like a thunderbolt, knocking one
down with a terrific jolt under the chin and
causing the other to look along the short barrel
of his blued automatic, he having discarded the
repeating rifle for the time being in favor of
the easier handled pocket gun.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the trio of discomfited rogues were all
handcuffed, Jack and his reliable partner turned
and faced the other way, so as to be ready for a
rush, should some of those valorous generals
decide to take advantage of the defensive security
of the rock cave, and bolt into its gaping mouth.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being actually attempted they met with
a demoralizing surprise when they found themselves
the objects of a hot fire, that brought about
a complete right-about face movement and
presently forced their ignominious surrender to
the gallant Colonel Morales and his fierce fighters,
who had once before gone through an interesting
campaign in that same old extinct volcano
vent, with warlike redskins as their opponents.</p>

<p class='c013'>The end was not long in coming, with many
of the would-be revolutionists holding up their
hands in complete surrender others escaping
by losing themselves along the scraggly sides of
the mountains and not a few either slain outright,
or seriously wounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and his chum had a chance to meet the
doughty Colonel Morales, pride of the Mexican
army, and be congratulated on their clever work
of rounding up such a jack-o’-lantern, fly-by-night
as Slim Garrabrant. Of course the two
comrades were eager to start back to the other
side of the border, since complications might
come up over their legal warrant to arrest a criminal
so badly wanted by the Washington authorities,
but who had made his headquarters south
of the international line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly they handed over Slim’s two lieutenants,
who would have to answer to a charge
of being hand-in-glove with those plotting generals,
and doubtless find themselves incarcerated
in a Mexican dungeon for some years, a fate that
made Perk shudder to contemplate.</p>

<p class='c013'>While he stood guard over their prisoner, Jack
sent Perk off at dawn, mounted on one of the
cavalry horses, and accompanied by a soldier
who would fetch back both animals, Perk’s duty
being to get the stranded ship off the ground,
and drop down at a more convenient spot closer
to the former mountain stronghold of the tiger-like
Yaquis.</p>

<p class='c013'>By nightfall they were hundreds of miles on
their way over Arizona and New Mexico, Jack
having decided to carry his prisoner, whose
wound did not prove to be very serious, though
painful enough—all the way to Washington, and
present him to his superior, with his customary
air of not realizing that he had done anything
extraordinary.</p>

<p class='c013'>That this thrilling feat was only a common
occurrence in the lives of such intrepid manhunters
as serve the Government through the
agency of the Secret Service and that from time
to time Jack and Perk might with reason be
expected to duplicate such adventurous feats can
be set down as certain; indeed, the title of the
next number in the Sky Detective Series, “<i>Eagles
of the Sky; or With Jack Ralston Along the Air
Lanes</i>,” a tale of the smugglers of the Florida
Coast, will grip the reader from start to finish,
and prove to be one of the most thrilling stories
ever written for lovers of action and valor.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

  <h2 id='ch01' class='c011'>CHAPTER I <br /> <br />READY FOR THE TAKE-OFF</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>It was a day in the late Fall when Jack
Ralston, accompanied by his best pal, Gabe
Perkiser, known simply as “Perk” by all his
friends, found themselves climbing out of a
hired taxi that had halted on the border of
Candler Flying Field just a short distance out
of Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! reg’lar mob out here today, seems
like,” observed Perk, as he took note of the
triple line of cars parked around the field, with
its numerous up-to-date hangars, and with ships
coming and going every few minutes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, you see Perk, it happens to be a big day
at stunt flying, with fat prizes for the winners.
All the better for us, I’d say, since our take-off
will hardly make a ripple in the pond, with all
this confusion going on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing, my boy,” continued Perk, with
one of his humorous grins that betokened a good-natured
chap; “and privacy’s just what we crave.
I guess now that might be the mail comin’ from
down East an’ New York?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A rotten guess then, Perk,” chortled the
other; “Eastern mail boat was due here at six-ten
this morning; the Pitcairn Aviation concern
handle that route, as well as the run between
Atlanta and Miami down in Florida; and I’m
telling you for a fact the boys holding the stick
with <i>that</i> corporation are nearly always on time
to the dot, come storm, come fog as thick as
pea-soup. The schedule I glimpsed at the Atlanta
post office gave the time of the East Coast
ship as seven-thirty P. M.; that from New Orleans
at six-thirty P. M.; and the one from
Chicago about the same time. So you see it
couldn’t be a mail crate dropping down right
now, unless they’d had to make a forced landing,
and lost time in making repairs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, come to think of it I sure did hear a
bus passin’ over just at peep o’ day,” admitted
Perk. “Let’s have a look-in while we’re here,
and see what a bag o’ tricks these stunt flyers
are holdin’ up their sleeves, so’s to give this
crowd a row o’ thrills.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suits me, Perk; no great hurry about our
jumping off, so long as we pull the gun before
dark sets in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! little difference it makes on a patch
as well lighted as this Candler Field o’ your
home city, old boy; and with a flashlight beacon
set every ten miles all the way down to Orleans,
to keep us on our course. Look at that guy
fairly burning the air like hot cakes—he must
be tryin’ to beat the speed record, I guess, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hardly a day comes without some record
going by the board,” remarked Jack, who had
a reputation as a safe and sane pilot, although
on occasion he had been known to put through
some tricks so death-defying as to make the
hearts of the spectators seem to jump up in
their throats with the thrill.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was quite correct when he stated that
Atlanta was the home city of his close friend
and chum; although Jack’s family had moved
away years back, and become fruit raisers in
far-off California. Still, having spent some
years in the Georgia capital Jack always liked
to drop in and renew a limited number of old
friendships when opportunity offered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack Ralston had begun his aviation work
starting at the lowest round, that of a Gypsy
pilot, flying an ancient boat at County Fairs and
Harvest Home gatherings; doing aerial stunts,
and “bailing out” by means of a parachute while
another pilot ran the ship; also taking up air
minded “sand-bags” as passengers at so much
each person.</p>

<p class='c013'>From this modest beginning he had finally
accepted a position with an aircraft corporation
having contracts with the Post Office Department
at Washington for carrying the mails, and
later on express matter as well; and last of all
working for Uncle Sam through joining the
Secret Service corps of skillful detectives, whose
activities covered every part of the Nation, and
even to adjacent countries as well.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the Government wearied of the bold
doings of one “Slippery Slim” Garrabrant, and
decided to “clip the wings” of that audacious
freebooter and bogus-money crook, it was only
natural they should pick Jack for this service.
The reasons for doing so were many, but what
counted most was Jack’s well known cleverness
as an all-round air pilot; for it happened that
the slick rogue who had been giving the revenue
men such a wild-goose chase, with his thumb
held up to his nose, so to speak, was himself a
remarkable master of the air lanes, he having
been an ace as a flying pilot over with the army
on the Argonne front in France.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since as a rule this troublesome offender carried
on his bold enterprises by means of a handy
plane—frequently with a single assistant, who
helped handle both ship and cargo—the man
thus selected to put a crimp in his activities was
likewise given full permission to engage a helper
from the same arm of the Government forces,
one who must of course know something about
the handling of a plane, so that in case of necessity
he could serve as co-pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack lost no time in picking Gabe Perkiser,
otherwise known simply as “Perk”—a man who
had supped with adventure since he was “knee
high to a duck”—a half Yankee—half Canuck,
drifting into the army, and serving with the
sausage observation balloon corps over in
France; from which patriotic occupation he
later on became a champion light-weight boxer.
Leaving the ring while as yet undefeated he
served for several years with the Canadian
Mounted Police. Here his smartness in usually
fetching back his man, no matter what the difficulties
that had to be surmounted, attracted
the attention of a gentleman connected with
Uncle Sam’s Secret Service, just then moose
hunting over the northern border, who finally
influenced Perk to join up with his force.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and the other had met under peculiar
conditions when both were tracking a bunch of
check raisers floating across the country and
leaving a wide swath of victims in their path.
They had become more than friends, although
meeting but seldom; then, when the opportunity
came for Jack to call upon Perk to join him in
the new job that had been turned over to his
charge, the latter had responded with alacrity.</p>

<p class='c013'>So here they were, on the threshold of an
affair that promised to engage their united talents
in running down the leader of the most
troublesome gang of counterfeit currency makers
known to the Government agents in the last
ten years.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every clue possessed at Headquarters had
been turned over to Jack at the time he was
given authority to carry on as the situation demanded;
although this information was a bit
limited, and much was left to the shrewdness
of the two trail hounds themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no hurry at all, and Jack had
always been one of those cautious workers who
meant to provide for all sorts of emergencies.
Only too well did he know how many a splendid
undertaking went on the rocks from lack of
foreseeing the next move on the part of the
astute criminals whose apprehension meant so
much to the Government, as well as the folks
they were victimizing.</p>

<p class='c013'>But by now he had decided everything was
arranged so far as human means would permit,
and that it was high time they started on their
long chase. Their boat, a Stinson Detroiter, a
monoplane with a Wright Whirlwind motor,
and reckoned to be an unusually swift craft, was
already loaded, and ready for immediate departure.
It had been stored in one of the big
hangars connected with the Candler Flying
Field but could be taxied into position when
Jack felt ready to skip off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their flying togs were also contained in a
locker in the same hangar, and could be donned
in a jiffy, even to the ’chute harness that was
so familiar to Jack, and a constant reminder of
early experiences when he was accustomed to
carry out his daily program of “quitting the
ship” with as much <i>sang froid</i> as though the
jump into space from a five thousand foot ceiling
were absolutely next to nothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>But plainly Perk was becoming a bit restless,
as though eager to be on his way; which fact
doubtless influenced Jack to eventually give the
word that took them to their hangar. Here
they commenced preparing for a night flight
that was expected to land them in New Orleans,
where Jack was to interview a certain representative
of the Government service, from whom
he anticipated receiving a few valuable tips that
would give them something tangible and serve
as a beginning of their arduous chase.</p>

<p class='c013'>While they were thus engaged someone
hailed them with a boisterous greeting, at which
Perk grinned, and made a suitable reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hey, Scotty, this your night off, is it—got
in from your route okay, and stepped out to see
the boys cut a few figger-eights in the sky—just
can’t keep away from the game, even when you
got a lay-off? What’s new, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They told me at the house you expected to
step off tonight, boys—is that a fact, or did they
slip an easy one over me, I want to know?” demanded
the other, who was apparently a mail
pilot friend of theirs—in fact, having the adjoining
room at the small hotel where they were
stopping.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” Jack told him, secretive as usual,
“we’re going further, and boosting the Stinson
Detroiter ship by showing what it has to set it
above most other boats. Plans not fully arranged
as yet, but we’re on our way; so it’s good-bye,
and good luck to you, Scotty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about that news, Scotty?” the insistent
Perk went on to demand, being by nature one of
those stubborn chaps who can never be happy
until they get what they are after, no matter
how trivial it may seem.</p>

<p class='c013'>The air mail pilot scratched his head, and
then with a grin answered Perk’s question.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much along the line of aviation;
but something queer happened to me—say, did
you boys sleep at home last night while I was
on the road?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We sure did,” Perk told him, and then
added: “What makes you ask that, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Didn’t hear any sort of racket in my den
did you, fellows?” continued the other; at which
Perk, after exchanging a look of bewilderment
with his pal, hastened to answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a thing, Scotty; but then you know I
sleep like a log; and it’d have to be a thunderclap
to wake me up; what’s been going on?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You got me guessing, Perk,” said the other,
with a look of disgust; “only when I got in this
morning I found my room looking like a hurricane
had struck it, my things tossed out of drawers,
my trunk broken open, and say, you never
saw such a dirty mess. Course I asked the boss
what it meant; but he was as much surprised
as I was—talked with every servant from the
cook down to Mary the chamber maid; but
nobody could tell a darned thing about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again Jack and Perk exchanged a swift
glance, as though the same idea had struck both
of them. Scotty did not appear to notice this,
being too worked up with the mystery that had
so suddenly gripped his fortunes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did you lose anything worth while, Scotty?”
Jack asked, in a voice that suggested sympathy;
but to his surprise the other shook his head in
the negative, and even grinned as he lifted his
heavy eyebrows to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s the funny part of it, boys; whoever
the sneak thief was, he didn’t even dent me a
little bit—so far as I c’n see not a blessed thing
is missing—fact is, I’m even better off than before
he paid that queer visit, ’cause he left this
old pocketbook mixed up with my traps; and
it ain’t mine for a fact, though I’m meaning to
spend the little wad of dough it holds. Like
manna coming down to the children of Israel
in the Wilderness, wouldn’t you say, boys?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lucky old hoss you are, Scotty,” remarked
Perk, enviously; while Jack nodded his head as
though to echo the sentiment.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c014'>CHAPTER II <br /> <br />THE LUCK OF SCOTTY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“Happen to have that pocketbook along with
you, Scotty?” asked Jack, in a matter of fact
tone; just as though he might be possessed of
ordinary curiosity concerning so amazing a
visit; since never before had he heard of a night
prowler leaving his own money behind him,
when his intention had been to rob his victim.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing, Jack,” promptly replied the air
mail pilot; “here, take a squint at my Christmas
present, dropped in by old Santa Claus
a bit before the reg’lar holiday season,” and with
a laugh he chucked the object in question into
the hand of the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Old, just as you remarked, Scotty,” observed
Jack, “and used a long time. It must have
slipped out of his pocket when he worked your
stuff over to mix it up like the devil.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Open it up and see what the blessed chump
left me in place of his card,” the other continued,
looking exceedingly proud over his lucky
find.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did that with alacrity; in fact it
was what he intended doing, for reasons of his
own; something more than curiosity influencing
him, it would appear.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gee whiz! a neat little bunch of the needful,
I’d say, Scotty, old hoss!” burst out the envious
Perk, his eyes fixed full upon the contents of
the much worn pocketbook, which Jack was
holding in his hand and apparently interested
in counting, for there were a number of bank
notes for various amounts, and among them just
three five-dollar bills, seemingly quite fresh,
though a bit soiled, as though they had been in
circulation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nineteen smackers in all,” announced Perk,
showing that he had also been keeping tabs on
the count. “Well, wouldn’t that knock you cold
though? Huh? that same caller must’ve been
looking for <i>me</i>, and just missed connections by
striking the next door. Well, here’s wishing you
the same old luck every time a sneak thief pays
you a visit, Scotty boy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack on his part was feeling of the three five-dollar
bills, and holding them up to the light
from the western sun that managed to come
into the hangar by way of the open doors.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What ails you, Jack?” demanded the recipient
of Fortune’s smiles, as he noticed these
strange actions on the part of his new friend.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much,” he was told, “only I’m going
to give you a bit of advice, partner, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to it, boy; always willing to take it
when it seems sound!” snapped the mail carrier,
briskly enough, still more than curious.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you’re wise, Scotty,” went on Jack, smilingly,
“you’ll not try to pass any one of these
five-dollar bills until you’ve asked the opinion
of some bank teller—it might get you into
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Zowie! what’s that you’re saying, Jack—don’t
tell me they’re off-color bills, counterfeits
in fact. Wouldn’t that be a rotten deal to hand
out, and me figgering how I’d spend them? Is
<i>that</i> what you mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon it’s so, Scotty, much as I hate to
knock your good luck,” Jack told him, with a
shake of his head. “I happened to have a little
experience in a small bank some years ago and
they did say I showed signs of being a clever
detector of bad money. That’s a clever job all
right; but I’m afraid it won’t stand the wash
worth a cent. Go slow, and don’t count your
chickens before they’re hatched. Also I’d advise
you not to go around telling about your windfall
until you’ve shown this stuff to some friendly
bank official, whose advice you’d be willing to
take. If he says it’s good stuff why forget what
I’m saying, and go the limit. But we’d better
be finishing our own job, Perk, and get off on
our jump.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Scotty hung around for a short time, looking
puzzled, as though he hardly knew how much
to believe. What Jack had said in his friendly
fashion had doubtless cast quite a damper on
certain bright dreams in which he had been indulging.
However, he finally decided to take
himself off, evidently eager to know whether
the laugh was on him or not, for he called out:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goodbye, Jack, Perk; and be sure to look me
up when next you drop in at Candler Field Airport;
like as not I’ll still be on my old job here,
unless they decide to transfer me somewhere else.
And say, Jack, I’m meaning to take your advice,
and get an opinion on this here stuff ’fore I try
to pass it out on any old duffer. So-long boys
and luck!”</p>

<p class='c013'>When the two comrades, adventure bound,
found themselves alone they looked at each other
in silence for almost a full minute, when a grin
started to travel over Perk’s well bronzed face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, wouldn’t it jar you though, to have such
luck knock at your door, and then give you a sly
kick?” he demanded of his companion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To tell the honest truth, Perk, I’m not thinking
about Scotty and his queer windfall; it’s
our own great good luck that’s making me suspect
we’re bound to carry this job through with
flying colors.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Eh? now what d’ye mean by saying that?”
asked the other hastily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Right in the beginning, Perk, we seem to
have stumbled on a nice little plum in the shape
of a clue—flung directly at our heads, you might
say in the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! do you mean to tell me those bogus
notes were off the same plates we’ve been
hearing so much about lately that I’ve been
dreamin’ I was tied hand an’ foot, an’ poked
under a dozen bales of them?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just that, as sure as you live, partner,” said
Jack, composedly; but if he could take it so
coolly, not so his right bower who showed signs
of extreme excitement and satisfaction, for he
thrust out his hand, that had so often been an
object of vast respect on the part of some welter
weight boxer, and insisted that Jack accept a
gentle shake.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re sure Fortune’s favorites,” Perk was
saying, striking an attitude as he thus proudly
spoke; “an’ with such luck hoverin’ over our
heads I vow all the Lower Regions with its devils
can’t prevail against us. But see here, old hoss,
there’s more than chance in this break o’ the
party who broke through Scotty’s door, and
panned all his traps—I guess now he must have
missed a cylinder, an’ jest passed us by in a
ground loop.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was accustomed to the other’s quaint way
of expressing himself, for he lost no time in
adding:</p>

<p class='c013'>“About that way, I take it, Perk. And if
what we suspect turns out to be true, it stands to
reason there’s some sort of big combine back of
it all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“With this same Slippery Slim Garrabrant
pulling the wires for the whole bunch, is that
what you mean, Jack?” demanded the other flyer
quickly; for when once set on the right track
Perk’s mind could travel speedily enough.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s certainly his brain that’s built up this
wide flim-flam trade in the make believe green
stuff that’s been fooling a whole lot of bank tellers,
it’s so near the genuine article. To
smash the combine we’ve got to check up on
Slim; after he’s caged the entire arrangement’s
bound to fall through.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, partner; and them’s my sentiments
every time,” admitted the eager Perk. “And
here, when we’re starting out to pull off our
fresh stunt, I’m wishing all the luck that’s going
to our little game. Meaning to give her a last
checking over, eh, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s a habit of mine, as you know, Perk; and
you might amuse yourself stowing the cargo
we’ve taken aboard, so’s to let us have room for
our feet when we take off. From the looks of
the junk you picked up anybody’d reckon we
planned to go into camp for a week or two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, mebbe that’s what’ll happen to us before
we strike pay dirt in this ticklish job,”
asserted Perk, stoutly. “You know we figgered
things out, and made up our minds this same
slick article of a Slim might have his hangout
over the line in Old Mexico, where he prints
his bad bills, and then comes across the line with
a big bunch in his ship, so’s to scatter the stuff
around to his agents in Texas and Arizona, or
it might be all through Southern California. If
that guess turns out to be a bullseye we might
be away off the line of travel for days at a stretch,
and a grub stake’d turn the trick okay, I’m thinking,
boss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack made no reply, for he was already busily
engaged in looking over his crate. This was, as
he had mentioned, an old habit, contracted in
the early days of his career as an aviator of sorts;
and most likely such extreme caution had saved
his life more than once.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he too worked close by, Perk was thinking
more or less about something that had caught
his ever watchful eye just before they entered
the hangar to make these last preparations for
their southern flight. As usual he was unable
to keep his speculations entirely to himself, since
he always liked to compare notes, and find out
whether his companion’s views coincided with
his own.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, Jack, did you happen to notice that
Ryan ship they’d just taken out of the shed before
ours?” he demanded, while still lifting
packages of various supplies, and stowing them
away in a shipshape fashion; so they would not
be likely to shift, and thus imperil the safety
of himself and comrade, should they chance to
encounter rough weather later on.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not particularly,” came the answer. “I was
too busy over my own affairs to bother with anything
that didn’t concern me in the least. What
of it, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing much, old hoss, only it was a next
to new bus, and hadn’t been flown more’n a few
thousand air miles, I’d guess. Couple of fellers
seemed to be the crew, one of ’em lookin’ like
he might be a pilot; and the other a chap that
was out to have a jolly good time sportin’ for
sport. I saw him handlin’ some sort of gun,
which made me guess he was down South for
the shootin’ season—mebbe after bear in the
Louisiana canebrakes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack laughed as if amused, for he had noted
the way in which the other made this stab at
what might be the designs of the unknown
parties.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Feel a bit envious I take it, Perk,” he observed,
laconically. “Always did yearn for the
day to come when you’d have a ship of your
own, and could spend all your spare time jumping
about the country, enjoying yourself with
rod and gun. Cheer up, old sport, you may live
to see that day yet, if things break right for us
in a few big games like this one we’re running
down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thanks for your good luck wishes, Jack,” the
other was saying; “I c’n just picture the bully
times that pair’ll like enough have sitting by
their camp-fire, living on game they’ve knocked
over, and not caring a darn whether school
keeps or not. Oh! well, if I live long enough
mebbe I may have a whiff of that kind of life
before I kick off for keeps; they say everything
comes to the man who waits, and that’s me.
There, that finishes my job, with everything
stowed away as slick as you please. When you’re
ready, Jack, we’ll be on our way.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c014'>CHAPTER III <br /> <br />HEADED SOUTH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Apparently Jack had completed his task
about the same time, for he was adjusting his
’chute harness, without which he seldom made a
long distance flight. This was only second nature
to him, because of the long experience he
had had in barnstorming, and doing stunts for
a living in years gone by.</p>

<p class='c013'>This accomplished, he stepped outside the
hangar, and beckoned to a couple of ground
workers who chanced to be close by, possibly
in anticipation of their services being required,
with a tip in prospect.</p>

<p class='c013'>Between them the ship was moved to the open,
and after that it would be a simple thing for
Jack to taxi across the strip of ground adjoining
the big Pitcairn hangar, so as to face such
wind as was stirring.</p>

<p class='c013'>With what Perk had said concerning the new
Ryan monoplane and its crew still fresh in his
mind, Jack did give a brief glance in that quarter.
He could only see that both men were fully
equipped with dungarees, helmets, and even
chutes fastened to their backs; which combination
was an effectual disguise, since their best
friends might have failed to recognize either
of them offhand.</p>

<p class='c013'>The one who was garbed in what seemed to
be fresh clean overalls, and who must be the
employer, seemed to feel a mild interest in their
movements, for he was looking that way through
his goggles, that had been pulled down as if in
preparation for some species of flight. The
other was busying himself adjusting something,
and from his greasy dungarees it was evident
he must be the working pilot of the Ryan craft.</p>

<p class='c013'>With all the bustle that was going on covering
the stunt flying and speed races, Jack did
not bother taking a second look; he failed to
have the same interest in the possible sporting
excursion of the unknown pair that had gripped
Perk and hence failed to let the matter occupy
any more of his limited time.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon both settled down in their respective
places in the double cockpit of the ship,
Jack of course occupying the front seat, since
he had been placed in command, with the other
acting as co-pilot and observer.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a very decent crate taken in all, that
had been secured for their work on this special
occasion, for Uncle Sam is never stingy in supplying
his agents of the Secret Service with
whatever they need, from means for swift travel
to the customary “grub” necessary to their upkeep
when “on the road.” These air detectives
in whom we are particularly interested just now,
as a rule were angling for big fish, and it was
absolutely necessary they should be given a free
hand when making their demands for proper
backing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, it’s goodbye to Candler Field for us
right now,” remarked Perk, as he shot a general
look around, being more or less interested in
the exciting events being pulled off in the air
circus. “Playtime’s past, and now we’ve just
got to put in our best licks along the line of
business. Huh! seems like them two guys are
meaning to pull out right on our heels, from the
lively way that greasy lad is jumping around—keeps
an eye on us in the bargain, as if it mattered
a lick whether we did get going before
he was ready to follow suit. Some folks never
do like anybody to show ’em their dust, even
when it don’t matter a pinch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then Jack waved his hand toward the two
hostlers whom he had generously tipped, and
pulled the gun in his accustomed careful fashion;
after which they started along the level
field for the takeoff, there being small necessity
for a runway on such a generous fairway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Faster and faster they flew along the ground,
and then with their wheels parting contact with
the earth up they started at an easy incline.
The roar of the motor already drowned most of
the clamor from the surging crowd, while the
racket of the whizzing propeller added to the
chorus so joyous to the ears of all real air pilots,
since nothing pleases them more than to feel they
are masters of a ship that is in “apple-pie” condition
for battling whatever lies ahead, be it
storm, fog or whatnot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Somehow Perk was twisting his head around
as if curious to ascertain whether that Ryan
crate had succeeded in imitating their example,
and was already making the preliminary dash
across the field—which luckily enough had
chanced to be fairly clear of maneuvering
planes, either descending, taking off, or being
taxied into position for the next stunt on the
program.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was getting well along by this
time, and already the first dim shadows of approaching
night were to be seen slipping
out from certain patches of pine trees ahead.
But the higher they climbed, now that a start
had been accomplished, the lighter it would become,
what with a lower horizon, and the sun
still hanging in plain sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once free from any possibility of any contact
with the wheeling and ducking planes—some of
which were doing the barrel roll, and others
making successive somersaults, with the daring
pilots proceeding while in an inverted position—Jack
could start spiraling, and climbing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rapidly was Candler Field fading from view
behind them since Jack had swung toward the
south, as if to lay his course directly for New
Orleans. Perk seemed to find a subtle attraction
back where they had just come from, since he
was again turning his head with nothing else to
do save gratify his innocent curiosity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! ’pears like they might be meaning to
strike for the Louisiana canebrake country, and
black bear diggings, just like I said,” he was
telling himself, with a chuckle of amusement
over his shrewd guess. “And say, that little
Ryan crate’s no slouch ’bout making speed, I’d
mention. Come along you sportin’ crowd—plenty
of room in the ceiling overhead, an’ nixey
a chance to bring about a collision. Take your
choice, and cut out for all you’re worth, boys.
If you get there before we do, just tell ’em we’re
acomin’ too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk continued to amuse himself in watching
the antics of the rival ship, and indulging in
all kinds of wild speculations as to what the real
object of those two sporty looking occupants
might prove to be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently thus far not the slightest suspicion
had entered his mind that the taking to the air
of the shining Ryan boat had the first thing to
do with their own skipping out, and heading
toward the Crescent City.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like as not when it gets real dark after a
bit,” Perk continued to say, being addicted to
talking to himself more or less, “we’ll soon lose
her, and have the field all to ourselves. Only
moving thing I c’n sight back there, ’cept them
circlin’ buzzards huntin’ for a carrion supper.
Guess everything’s going along first class
and we’re in for a comfortable night run down
over the corn and sugarcane country. This is
the life for little Perk, you hear me saying,
everybody—it’s got the boxin’ game, and even
that outdoor life up with the Mounties in Canada,
beat to a frazzle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk busied himself with his duties for
some time, and presently became aware of the
fact that evening was actually at hand; for the
sun had dropped out of sight over in the far
west, and looking down he found it absolutely
impossible to distinguish what lay beneath them
some two thousand feet more or less earthward—there
might be forests, farms, hills or swales
following each other in rapid succession; but all
masked by the sable curtains of night. When
the moon rose later on, its light would not afford
them any opportunity for marking any peculiarities
of the ground down there, since it must
simply present the appearance of a swiftly moving
panorama.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, moved once more by his old curiosity
concerning the ship that had started off immediately
after their own jump, again twisted his
head so as to take another backward look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hanged if she ain’t keeping on our tail right
along,” he told himself, as if a bit surprised,
though not in the least troubled, since there
could be no possible connection between this
Ryan monoplane and their own old bus, bent
on reeling off so many miles per hour, and aiming
to make the airport at New Orleans by early
dawn or before, according to how the weather
treated them, and the speed Jack could coax
from his aerial steed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Further inspection convinced Perk that the
rival ship was neither gaining nor losing as the
two sped along their way; a fact that began to
make him “sit up and take notice,” and then
express himself confidentially:</p>

<p class='c013'>“By jinks! it looks to me like that clever little
Ryan bus could make circles around our tub
’less Jack c’n squeeze a lot more snap from our
Whirlwind motor. Now what game c’n that
pair of sports be playin’ right now, I want to
know—must be they’re so used to bettin’ on
anything an’ everything they’re meanin’ to keep
right on our tail all night long, just to make us
hump along, and get the laugh on us poor
guys.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c014'>CHAPTER IV <br /> <br />THE GRIM PURSUER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>As the minutes crept along Perk’s uneasiness
commenced to make itself more manifest, finally
reaching such a condition that he felt it would
ease his mind if only he could get the opinion
of his companion on the subject.</p>

<p class='c013'>To do this it would be necessary that they
should make use of the head earphones that had
been taken along for this particular purpose.
Accordingly he quickly adjusted his own, and
then proceeded to advise Jack as to what he
wished to do. Since these useful adjuncts of the
pilot’s outfit were so arranged that they could
be slipped on and off with little loss of time,
it was an easy matter for Perk to apply them,
after which he went on to speak.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, seems like that pesky little Ryan insect’s
been tailing us right along, though mebbe
now you didn’t notice it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know it, Perk—fact is I proved that fact
to my own satisfaction, for twice now I’ve
changed our course, once into the west, and
again heading into the southwest, even if it
didn’t catch your attention.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You did that same; and say, what happened,
Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a blessed thing,” came the immediate
answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They still hung on our tail, do you mean,
old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like they did—queer how two pilots,
strangers both, would take a notion to change
their course, not once but twice running,” commented
Jack in his non-committal fashion that
always had Perk guessing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Strikes me as something more than a happy
chance,” asserted Perk, beginning to throw off
that comfortable feeling with which he had
wrapped himself as he contemplated a steady
going night run, with never a reason for anything
gripping them by way of excitement;
“ev’ry little movement of that Ryan two-seater’s
got a meanin’ of its own. Now what ails the
ducks I want to know—how c’n our movements
have a mite to do with what they’re planning
to carry out—got any idea along them lines, old
hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing definite as yet,” answered Jack; “I
was starting to figure it out just when you barged
in, and opened this talk fest up with your question.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, come to think of it, what did you make
out of that stiff yarn Scotty put over on us a
while ago?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was raw stuff for a fact; but I don’t question
anything he told us, remember, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whoever his mysterious visitor was he must
have been hunting for something, that’s dead
sure!” declared Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Something he didn’t find, either,” continued
Jack’s assistant pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Scotty was ready to swear to that fact, and
he ought to know.” Jack countered by saying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“But see here, old hoss, you’ve got some sorter
idea what the game might abeen, haven’t you
for a fact?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon I know why the sneak thief failed
to carry away the thing he was looking for, if
that’s what you mean, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As what, boss—I’m all worked up wantin’
to know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perhaps the reason might have been because
the object of his search happened at that very
time to be safe and snug in the inside pocket
of this same coat I’m wearing under my overalls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At hearing this startling announcement Perk
gave a quick look into his pal’s face, there being
just enough light remaining in the western sky
to allow this searching glance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! now I’m beginning to get somewhere,
and ready to quit this gropin’ around,
like a man in a London fog—that letter you had
this very morning from Headquarters—somehow
’r other some of the gang had wind of your
gettin’ it, and they guessed it’d be kept
safe under lock and key in your room at the
hotel; and then they got balled up about the
number on the door, so they broke into the wrong
room. Jack, am I on the right track?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems that’s so, according to my notion,
Perk; unless I miss my guess that’s the way
things stand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A disgusted grunt from Perk told that he did
not feel very happy over certain facts in the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gosh-a-mighty!” he burst out, explosively,
“if that’s right, then the tricky crowd know you’n
me are on this case—that even right now we’re
starting out to pluck their tail feathers, and
fetch that master-crook to the bar!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! I expected that would happen,” said
Jack, indifferently. “Having been told by several
of the best men in the service that Slim was
the smartest all-round dopester known in all the
land, I anticipated that he’d have means for
finding out that fact long ago—that there might
be a leak around Headquarters; for spies can
worm in almost anywhere, given an opportunity,
and the backing of a big bunch of jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yet that fact don’t seem to rattle you worth
a red cent, old hoss,” continued the puzzled
Perk, who ofttimes found the actions of his cool
partner a mystery he could not solve, because of
his own more impetuous ways.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope not,” was all Jack said in reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thunder and lightning!” ejaculated the co-pilot,
as if an illuminating idea had suddenly
flashed through his brain—“that Ryan bus,
Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what of it?” demanded the one at the
stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What if that sporty guy I told you about
should turn out to be the critter who broke into
Scotty’s room, and made it a complete wreck?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It could happen that way, Perk; seems like
you’re working on a warm scent right now. Pity
we didn’t get a good look at the gentleman before
he hid his face behind that helmet and goggles;
then at least we’d know him if ever we happened
to run across his trail.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The other was almost frothing at the mouth
through disgust and anger combined; but he
managed to say, with a select few hard words
interlarded as a vent to his outraged feelings:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Give me half a chance and I’ll mark him so
there’s be no difficulty in locating the sneak when
we meet him again—I’d put a bit of lead
through his arm that’d keep him out of the scrap
for a week of Sundays; or else clip off one of
his ears, to stamp him as a low-down crook.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack knew full well that this was no idle threat
on the part of his running mate; for Perk had a
reputation as a pistol shot second to none in the
entire service, being a natural born marksman.</p>

<p class='c013'>He lapsed into a spell of silence after making
that vicious remark; but from the way he
glanced back again and again it looked as
though Perk meant to keep close tabs on the
craft that was dogging their own ship so
steadily.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were roaring on their way, and it would
seem as if they must be showing a clean pair of
heels to anything in their rear; but just the same,
Perk, with the vision of an air-minded individual,
could readily understand how the speedy
Ryan plane was slowly but insidiously picking
up on them continuously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blamed nuisance,” he was muttering to himself
when this important fact became a positive
truth; “guess now that rip-snorter could make
circles round us, if so be he wanted to. Shucks!
what’s left to us I want to know; an’ just what
does he ’spect to accomplish with all this chasin’
us? Might as well get out my little old
six-shot bear gun, so’s to be ready in case
there’s any sort o’ ruction aheadin’ our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The idea seemed to afford him a strange sort
of grim satisfaction, for bending down he ran
his hand under the coaming of the cockpit; to
almost immediately withdraw a very decent
looking sporting repeating rifle, evidently his
working tool whenever he felt disposed to spend
a week in the wilds, either alone, or with some
boon companions also yearning for wild game
and the much desired campfire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold tight, Perk,” Jack was saying just
then; “going into a nose dive, and see if that
will upset his calculations; for he’s got me buffaloed
all right as to what’s in the wind!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Almost immediately they turned the nose of
their craft earthward, and went down on a
swift slant. Perk kept his head turned even as
this maneuvre was being executed, and what he
saw was something calculated to almost take
his breath away; for where the pursuing Ryan
ship loomed up as a shadowy form, vivid
splashes, as of fire, were coming in quick succession—he
could even imagine he heard the pulsating
staccato reports following each other in
succession, just as in those never-to-be-forgotten
days when he would have a covey of
devil-may-care German air fighters stepping on
the tail of his old-fashioned boat, and peppering
him from their rapid-firing guns!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c014'>CHAPTER V <br /> <br />THE DUEL IN THE AIR</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The significant flashes abruptly ceased; but
Perk realized this was only because the expert
pilot handling that same Ryan wasp was also
ducking down in an exact copy of their own
game.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the moment Perk lost sight of the shadowy
pursuing craft; then Jack changed his tactics,
and once again brought his boat on an even
keel. Perk strained his eyesight in an endeavor
to pick up the other ship after it too had swung
into a direct course.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Devil take that guy at the stick,” he stormed
to himself, although Jack caught almost every
word, since the earphones were still in operation,
“he’s seen our move, an’ gone us one better.
No slouch o’ a pilot, either, I’ll admit. When
that gent who goes by the name o’ Slippery Slim
picks his gang he knows how to pull trumps
out of the pack all right. Give him another
shoot, Jack, old hoss; mebbe he wont be so lucky
next time. He’s got some kind o’ a rapid-fire
shooter aboard, and had started to send a hail
o’ lead ’bout our ears just as you turned the trick
on him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was apparently quite willing to give a
repeat, for hardly had the other ceased shouting
than they again shot down in a dizzy dive
that seemed likely to lower their altitude by
something like five hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was keeping a close watch, and knew
that once more the grim pursuer had copied
their daring maneuvre.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s a good one, or I’ll eat my hat!” he burst
out, as they were “cutting a blue streak” once
more through the growing darkness, and he
could see those suggestive flashes again punctuating
the gloom in their track. “Jack, he’s
started that racket again, don’t you know; and
any second we may get a slug in our belly, bustin’
things all to flinders. Try a razzle-dazzle on
the boob, old broncho!”</p>

<p class='c013'>So making a bank, Jack changed his course,
running at right angles, and if anything at a
faster pace than ever. Perk had the situation
“sized up to a fraction,” as he himself would
have called it; he realized that it was only
through the greatest of good luck they had escaped
being hit by one of those flying missiles;
and that so long as the mysterious enemy kept
using their ship for a flying target they were in
constant peril. Despite all this ducking and
dodging on Jack’s part he did not seem successful
in throwing the pursuing craft off the track.
To be sure the darkness was gradually growing
thicker with every passing minute, and this
seemed to be their only hope of crawling out of
a “hot hole,” according to Perk’s calculations.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk afterwards frankly admitted that he was
frothing at the mouth on account of finding himself
up against a situation where the cards
seemed stacked against him—where his hands
were tied as it were, and that reckless pilot, chasing
after them hell-bent, held all the trumps.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No use tryin’ that game any longer, Jack,
boy!” he yelled suddenly. “See the glim all
’round us, partner—sure as you live they’ve
even got some kind o’ a searchlight aboard, just
like they’d planned all this thing out beforehand.
Guess now it’s up to Little Perk to put
a plug into their game. Hold her steady a bit,
boss; I’m meaning to make ’em sit up an’ take
notice they can’t hog <i>all</i> the fun going. Watch
my smoke, Jack, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a delicate situation without any doubt;
for if those aboard that little Ryan plane, taking
advantage of the halo of light covering the craft
they followed, continued to make use of their
rapidfire gun, the danger of a hit had vastly increased;
but Perk must have some sort of scheme
in mind it was evident, or he would never have
asked his chum to steady the badly wobbling
boat when such action only doubled their peril.</p>

<p class='c013'>Calmly and deliberately, as though simply
bent on fetching down a deer he wanted for
his next camp supper, steady old Perk had his
faithful gun up to his shoulder, and was sighting
that piercing glare of light that marked the bow
of the pursuing aircraft, betraying the presence
of a searchlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Possibly owing to the clamor of their own
working motor Jack could not tell when his
companion unloosed a fusilade of shots; but he
did know that something suddenly changed the
situation, and to their advantage; for as though
a blanket had been tossed over the piercing
ray the illumination abruptly ceased, leaving
them to continue their wild flight shrouded in
encompassing darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, too, the sound of Perk’s exulting yell
was quite enough to tell the story of his success
in finding a glowing target for one of his several
missiles—the old sharpshooter had evidently
lost none of his cunning by reason of a lapse in
action.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Set ’em up in the other alley, boys—give your
Dutch uncle a chance to show an old trick or
two! Now <i>will</i> you be good, or must I give
you another smash in the jaw—better haul off
while the haulin’s good, fellers—I’d sure hate to
make you crack up, and fade out!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Even though his clever shot had doubtless
utterly smashed the searchlight, and put it out
of business, that bothersome rapidfire gun was
still in working order, as Perk discovered when
once more those insistent flashes, following closely
upon each others’ heels, announced a fresh
barrage, with the unseen, unheard hissing bullets
doubtless whizzing all around them.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was adding insult to injury, Perk was
doubtless telling himself, as he realized that his
lucky shot had after all failed to daunt that
stubborn pair in the speedy Ryan ship.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You <i>will</i> have it, seems like,” he growled
to himself; for since he had discarded his earphone
harness just previous to starting his late
“shooting spree,” Perk could no longer hold
intercourse with his fellow flyer; “all right then,
I’ll try some more o’ the same sorter medicine;
what’s good for the goose orter be fine for the
gander. Mind your eye now, boys, and keep
a tight grip on your chutes if anything happens
not down in your gamble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again did the continual flash of spitting fire
from the gun afford the sharpshooter in the
chased ship abundant opportunities for focussing
his aim; although instinct may have
taken the place of vision on Perk’s part.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fortunately Jack must have been expecting
something along those lines, knowing his companion
so well, and how he was always eager
to “repeat” when things were coming his way;
for he kept the flying boat wonderfully steady
just then, even though realizing how such action
doubled their own chances of being hit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was now shooting on general principles,
in hopes of being fortunate enough to find a
billet for one of his random bullets. He went
at the business with all the <i>sang froid</i> of a veteran
fighter, accustomed to meeting hostile
craft up in the wide air spaces, or even above
the clouds—all the fierce delight of matching
his skill and life against a foeman worthy of his
steel had once more gripped the old flying warrior;
and it may be for the moment he deluded
himself with the belief that this was but a reincarnation
of those never-to-be-forgotten days
when all Europe was held fast in the throes of
the grisly war-god.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly Perk ceased firing, nor was this
caused by the magazine of his repeating rifle
being empty—he had seen that the discharges
back yonder were no longer in full blast, showing
that something must have happened to cause
such a sudden cessation to hostilities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before he could attempt to analyze what this
might mean it was all flashed before his questioning
mind—a burst of flames came from the
spot where last he had seen the shadowy shape
of their persistent pursuer clipping through
space like a blazing meteor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk sat there doubled up, his mouth half
open, staring with might and main, as some
object began to drop toward the earth with ever
increasing speed—something which he knew
full well must of necessity be the beautiful little
Ryan plane, which he had admired so much
when at Candler Field at close of the late day,
and before this wild dash into the darkness of
night began.</p>

<p class='c013'>Evidently one of his missiles (fired with such
grim determination when he “took the bit in
his teeth,” and struck back) had found its mark,
and unleashed the dangerous contents of the
gasoline reservoir, with the splashing fluid instantly
catching fire from the exploding spark
of the running motor.</p>

<p class='c013'>No flyer ever saw his enemy going down in a
flaming coffin without feeling compassion gripping
him; that one moment had changed his
heart from bitter hatred to a sense of pity; knowing
as he must have done that the day might
be near at hand when he too would share in a
similar dreadful fate.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so Perk found himself all in a nervous
tremble as, laying down his gun, he managed
once more to adjust the head harness, so as to
be able to again hold communication with his
fellow adventurer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c014'>CHAPTER VI <br /> <br />PARACHUTE JUMPERS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Just then Jack hurriedly banked, and swung
around as though to double back on their late
course. This of course told Perk the pilot must
be already aware of the terrible tragedy that
was being enacted close at hand, and meant to
see its finish with his own eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the abrupt change in their course he
was in time to catch a glimpse of the flaming
object still spiraling earthwards, a billow of fire
that glowed suggestively in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then far below it seemed to strike the ground—they
heard no sound whatever, but the fire
became stationary; although increasing in fury,
since the wind created by its passage no longer
whipped the devouring flames. Evidently by
the time the conflagration stopped for want of
further material on which to feed, nothing inflammable
would be left of the once haughty
little Ryan masterpiece save the engine, and
other metal parts.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the big idea, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk asked this as a leader, wishing to get a
better grip on his own nerves, since they had
been dreadfully shocked at the dire result of his
random shot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Going to circle around a few times, and drop
down a bit,” came the illuminating reply;
“though I reckon it’s no use, since nothing could
live in all that awful blast.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe not, Jack,” remarked Perk, a bit
cheerily; “but there’s a fair chance neither o’
them guys got snagged in the flash o’ that gas.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Perk, have you some foundation
for saying that?” demanded the other, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure—they jumped all right, boss,” Perk
told him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You saw them do it then, did you, boy?”
continued Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They bailed out okay—I saw two take the
jump right after the first flash came—went down
like plummets in the bargain—smart lads those
guys are, I’m tellin’ you, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>No doubt Jack was glad to hear this bit of
news, for it had filled him with horror to realize
that in order to escape they had been compelled
to ruthlessly take human life. He was
much younger than Perk, veteran of the World
War, who had grown more or less hardened
to such happenings when staking his own life
against that of a tricky German air pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Still goin’ down, are you?” asked Perk shortly
afterwards, on finding that they were still
swinging around in a wide circle, that burning
pyre far below being the hub of the wheel of
which their boat was the outer tire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Might as well,” came the ready answer,
showing that Jack had made up his mind
hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess now they’ll get down somehow, boss;
a whole lot depends on what kind o’ landin’
they’ll be able to make—if its rocks, or trees,
they got to strike it’s apt to be some hard sleddin’
for the boys. Say, ’taint possible now you’re
fixin’ to try an’ lend ’em a helpin’ hand? I’d
hate to know they’d been wiped off the map in
that hot fire; but somehow I don’t feel like
playin’ the part o’ the Good Samaritan to such
man devils as them two.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No danger of my trying to make a landing
where the chances are ten to one it just <i>can’t</i> be
done,” explained Jack, seeing that his companion
was almost ready to mutiny if any such mad
proceeding were contemplated. “I’d just feel
better if I knew they’d reached ground okay;
then we could keep on our way, and it’d be up
to them to get out of the scrape.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! I get you, partner,” grunted the relieved
Perk. “Don’t think I’m bitter about the
thing, ’cause they’re sure hot stuff all right; but
I’m a bit slow to accept that forgive and forget
stuff, specially after any guy’s tried his level
best to gimme a dirty deal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll try the thing out while on the job,”
Jack announced. “Our own wonderful escape
from meeting just that same kind of fate makes
me kind of soft. Perhaps we’ll not be able to
learn a single thing; you know how it often is
when you’ve finally struck ground after quitting
the ship by the chute route—all out of breath—sometimes
knocked up a bit, if you escape broken
bones—not any shape to shout, or do anything
but just lie there, and suck in the air in big
gasps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, that’s right for you, old hoss,” Perk
readily agreed. “Me, I once got a collar bone
smashed that way. No harm in our makin’ a
few swings around these diggin’s ’fore we put
out for Orleans. That fire keeps burnin’ like
things they got sprinkled right well with the
juice when the tank blew up. Go to it, Jack,
just as you please, never mindin’ a few squeals
from a hard-boiled guy like Perk Perkiser.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m going to shut down on the engine, and
take a little glide, so we can pick up anything
like a yell,” announced the pilot a minute later.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to it—duck then, boy!” snapped Perk,
as he temporarily relieved himself of his ear-phones
in order to catch anything bordering on
a shout from the ground below.</p>

<p class='c013'>The simple expedient was carried out successfully,
and when once again they leveled out,
to continue circling, Jack asked eagerly:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get anything, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a bleat, partner,” replied the other, who
had hurriedly held his earphones in position so
as to cover the emergency.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sorry for that, but we’ll try a couple more
times before calling it all off,” suggested Jack,
who could be more or less persistent when the
occasion arose for such action, though never
carrying it so far as to be reckless.</p>

<p class='c013'>So a dozen seconds or so afterwards he again
gave warning that it was time for another drop
of a few hundred feet—not that they meant to
take any chances by getting too close to the unknown
terrain lying in the pitch blackness under
the flying ship; but simply to be able to listen
with the horrid clamor of the bustling engine
momentarily stilled.</p>

<p class='c013'>No better success followed this second maneuvre—all
was deathly silent around, above,
below, as though never a solitary living human
being existed within miles of the spot where
the destruction of the Ryan monoplane had
taken place.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll give a third and last try,” was Jack’s
announced decision, to which Perk added:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Three times, and batter’s out—by then I rather
guess we’ll be down close enough to the solid
ground to make another drop dangerous. Either
way I’m satisfied we’ve done the right thing,
old hoss. Suit yourself when you see fit to
coast,” whereupon he once more denuded his
ears of the exceedingly useful and really indispensable
phone harness, to await the occasion
of the last try in the line of an aviator’s
duty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it, Perk?—get a whisper?”</p>

<p class='c013'>They had completed the glide, and were once
more on a level course, with Jack even turning
the nose of the ship a bit heavenward; since
neither of them knew what the nature of the
ground below must be—whether some hill lay
directly ahead, against which they might smash
for a complete wipeout.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! a heap more’n that, partner!” came
the triumphant reply. “Heard a shout, an’ then
another some distance off—struck me both
jumpers had lit okay, and were tryin’ to communicate,
so’s to get together again. Guess
things ain’t so bad after all with them guys, an’
we c’n be movin’ on our way without botherin’
any more ’bout their safety. Some two-legged
varmints seem to be watched over by Old Satan
hisself, they bein’ that venomous, and evil-minded.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack made no rejoinder to this remark, tinged
with bitterness as it was, only pointed the nose
of his craft upward, and started to spiral for
altitude. Undoubtedly he was feeling greatly
relieved because of their having escaped so
miraculously from the hovering peril; and best
of all managed to turn the tables on those who
would have encompassed their destruction just
in order to defend the lawless game in which
they were engaged in connection with Slippery
Slim.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk must have been doing a little hard thinking
as the time passed and they raced on their
way, for later on he started to speak; and as
usual his line of chatter told that he was seeking
information, trying to find a solution of
certain exasperating puzzles that were “twisting
his intellects,” as he himself described
matters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Things kind o’ got me goofy, partner, an’
I’d like you to raise the curtain some, if so be
you feel so bent. First place I guess it goes
without questionin’ that these huskies must be
in cohunks with that there big gun, Slippery
Slim Garrabrant?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! that’s a dead certainty—who else would
have any reason for waylaying us in Atlanta,
and setting up this trap for us to fall into?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! then it stands to reason, boss, he’s
got means for findin’ out what the Secret Service
aims to do; an’ so has been able to play the boys
for suckers every time they set out to lay him
by the heels, eh, Jack, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s past history, Perk; even the Big Boss
got wise to it, and tried everything possible to
learn where the great leak happened; but our
experience proves they haven’t discovered it so
far. I’m making up my mind that the closer
we draw to the headquarters of this rotten clique
of crime, where they make the bogus long-green
that’s been flooding the whole West for a year
and more, why, the harder our job is bound
to be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which tickles me a heap, boy—I’m just
yearnin’ for comin’ to grips with that gazaboo
o’ a Slim; and now we’re on to the job I’ll never
be happy ’till he’s on his way to that big Government
pen we glimpsed in Atlanta, where
some other lads we helped to pinch are doin’
time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if you keep on as you’ve started, Perk,
we’ll flatten the whole gang like pancakes—they’ve
stacked up against a new sort of revenue
dog when they started a shooter of your calibre
on the trail. First you smashed their searchlight,
and then sent a chuck of lead into the
gas tank that broke up the game. That’s the
kind of a pinch hitter you are, partner; and
right now I want to congratulate you on such
dandy marksmanship.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lay off that stuff, Jack—nothin’ but great
luck fetched the bacon home for this lad. But
me, I’m shakin’ hands with myself ’cause I
had that hunch a bear gun mightn’t be such a
bad thing to tote along on a trip that’s goin’ to
carry us across the border, an’ into Old Mex,
like as not; where the greasers are sometimes
tough nuts an’ hard to handle they tell me.
’Spose we’ll run across them two hill billies
again, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wouldn’t surprise me a bit if we did,” replied
the pilot, leveling off at a three thousand
foot ceiling, and still heading due southwest.
“Like as not they’ve got plenty of ready cash
along; and after having been so cleverly upset in
their calculations, due to your beating them silly
with a barrage of hot lead, they’ll be hot to wipe
out their disgrace. Oh! yes, we’re going to run
up against that foxey pair again before the book
is closed for keeps.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c014'>CHAPTER VII <br /> <br />STRIKING THE FOG BELT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>With the stars shining brightly above them,
and a moon just past its full climbing the eastern
heavens, having dissipated the darkness of the
earlier part of the night, Jack and his fellow
voyager continued plunging along in a very
satisfactory fashion, having no reason for feeling
further concern regarding the peril to
which they had been so lately subjected.</p>

<p class='c013'>But things were not destined to continue so
comfortably for the two adventurers, it seemed.
Perk was just congratulating himself for about
the fourth time at having such a comfortable
flight, when he sat up and took notice of the
fact that those heavenly bodies were beginning
to look exceedingly hazy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Danged shame, that’s what, to spoil such a
dandy night!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What ails you now?” demanded Jack, on
hearing the other make this little remark that
bespoke exasperation at least; “another boat on
our tail?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I guess not just now,” replied Perk,
scoffingly; “one was more’n enough for a single
jump. But we’re agoin’ to run into a pesky
fog belt, sure as you’re born, old hoss!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That all?” laughed the other, who apparently
saw nothing of particular consequence
about such a common happening; “it may perhaps
manage to slow us down more or less; but
what does that matter, when we’ve got time to
burn. The Big Boss told us, remember, not to
hurry things at all—plenty of time, oodles of
money, and any backing we chose to call for in
the way of a new boat, or more helpers. We
should worry, old scout!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Tain’t that in peticular Jack,” complained
the other; “but of all things a sky detective’s got
to run smack up against, fog’s the one I despise
most. It’s got me in bad more’n a few times, so
I’ve grown to look on the peasoup stuff like it
was my—er, what-dye-call it—Nebraska, no, I
mean Nemesis.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, now you mention it, Perk, I remember
you telling me something about that strange feeling
you have creep over you. No need for you
to apologize—in my knocking around among airmen
I’ve found that often even the most daring
and reckless in the bunch had some kind of a
weakness, if only you looked far enough under
the surface; just as sometimes you’ll find a boasting
bully actually afraid of his little wife at
home, who’s smacked him with her handy rolling
pin many a time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! wasn’t I a canvas man ’long with a
travelin’ circus a wheen o’ years ago, an’ didn’t
I see the biggest elephant in captivity rear up
on his hind legs, lift his trunk sky-high in the
air, an’ squeal like fun just when a little half
grown mouse happened to run along near his
alley. Well, I’m the tusker, an’ fog is the
mouse, as you might say—we never do get on
well as a combine. Hope it hugs the ground,
an’ leaves us a clear track up among the clouds
I c’n see creepin’ up ahead yonder.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Doesn’t bother me a whit, partner; don’t
forget we’ve got that new radio beacon aboard
to try out; and if it’s as clever as I’ve heard tell
it’ll carry us along our route to Orleans through
the thickest nest of fog anybody ever stacked up
against. Naturally we can’t expect to get the
full benefit of its capacity to hold a speeding
plane on its true course; because the invention’s
hardly more than half baked up to now; but I
set it according to directions, and if at any time
we begin to slide off our course the light that
springs up is bound to give warning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A bully good layout I’d say, if it c’n do what
they claim,” ventured Perk, who undoubtedly
had read certain things concerning the new invention,
and was eager to learn just how it would
pan out. “You showed a level head, partner,
when you decided to take the offer o’ that gent
in Atlanta, and try the thing out. Guess, then,
I needn’t bother my head ’bout gettin’ astray;
if things keep bein’ invented it ain’t goin’ to be
very long till a pilot’ll get slapped good an’
hard if he misses runnin’ on a straight line, or
even veers from his proper course in a great big
blow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re living in a machine age, Perk, and
every day things are heading that way on the
run—electric helps in kitchen, factory, and even
aboard our air cruisers. While the brainwork
and strain grow harder the actual manual labor
is lessened all the time. But as you say it’s getting
a bit hazy, and chances are we’re in for a
spell of blue fog.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Ten minutes afterwards there could not be
the least doubt concerning that fact, for by degrees
even the stars vanished from view, ditto
the gorgeous round moon. Still, since the sky
remained brighter in the east, it was not at all
difficult to tell where the fair mistress of the
Southern night had hidden her face behind the
opaque veil.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was now flying by instruments alone,
since never a thing could be seen by the keenest
eye above, below—they seemed to be hung in
unlimited space; but pushing along with considerable
speed just the same, bound for the distant
city on the vast Mississippi, situated not so
very far from its delta.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus passed a full hour.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly Perk saw a small light spring into
view on one side of the plane, and it certainly
electrified him considerably.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hi! there, partner, we’re off our track—shifted
to the east, seems like, unless I’m away
wrong in sizin’ things up ’cordin’ to Hoyle.
Got to swing her to the larboard-watch side, I
kinder guess—how ’bout that, boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You hit it that time, Perk, and here she goes
to climb back to our true course. Worked just
as we figured it would, and put us wise to a fact
we’d hardly have picked up in any other way.
I reckon now this same radio beacon’s bound to
turn out a great help to the poor badgered air
pilot, flying blind when fog hides the ground
beacons, and he gets no aid from the heavens
above.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll say it’s the best thing I’ve struck for a
long time,” affirmed the delighted Perk.
“There she goes—the glim I mean—closed shop,
havin’ ’complished the business set for her;
showing we must have struck our real course
again.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Easy money,” laughed Jack, just as well satisfied.
“Makes a fellow sit up and try to guess
what the next big idea connected with aviation
will prove to be; doesn’t seem to be any limit to
the dazzling discoveries these scientific chaps’ll
turn out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, partner—like that big chute they’re
trying out, which they claim will keep any
plane from crashing—if the engine goes dead
all you got to do is to press a little button, and
when the drop comes open goes the monster umbrella,
able to hold you and the crate suspended
in the air, to gradually fall to the earth like the
colored balls from a bursted skyrocket. Great
stunt that, an’ I’m livin’ in hopes it’ll be my
luck to some day find myself aboard a ship that’s
equipped with such a giant chute, an’ have the
glorious experience of seeing the thing work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack seemed to consider it the part of wisdom
to pull up more or less, as they were in no hurry,
and could drop down on the aviation field at
New Orleans by dawn, even though they concluded
to just “loaf along.” Disliking anything
pertaining to fog Perk naturally said nothing
to hint at a desire for further speed; besides
his own good sense told him that what his mate
had just said with regard to no necessity existing
for haste, was sound logic, and a due regard
for “safety first.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So the time slipped away, with midnight finding
them past the meridian of their projected
flight. Perk had long since subsided and
seemed content to sit there in the double cockpit,
letting his thoughts roam back to the exciting
developments of the earlier night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Years had elapsed since last he watched a
doomed plane writhing and twisting in its death
agonies, with the flames wrapping it in an envelope—a
blazing coffin speeding headlong to a
final crash; and here, strange to say, after all
that time intervening he had again passed
through a similar experience. Now that he had
an opportunity to calmly review the happening,
Perk admitted he was pleased to know the two
occupants of the Ryan cockpit had apparently
escaped a miserable fate that must have been
laid at his door.</p>

<p class='c013'>Two A. M. and all’s well!</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk figured that when a few more times
sixty minutes had passed it would be time for
them to catch a first glimpse of the great rolling
turgid stream that could, when the heavy rains
united with the melting snows up in the mountains
of the Far West, create vast floods that
placed much of the low country along the river
under many feet of water. It had been a long
time since last Perk had set eyes on the Mississippi,
and hence he was considerably worked
up over the prospect of soon glimpsing the
mighty flood.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c014'>CHAPTER VIII <br /> <br />NEW ORLEANS—FIRST STOP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“There she rolls, Jack, old boy—the greatest
stream in the whole U.S.A.—I swan if she
don’t look just as fine as when I glimpsed her
for the first time many years ago!”</p>

<p class='c013'>That was Perk’s tribute on beholding the
Lower Mississippi perhaps thirty miles above
New Orleans; he displayed almost as much enthusiasm
as those early discoverers did centuries
back, when their distended eyes took in the
mighty sweep of the flood rolling down toward
its junction with the Mexican Gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was early dawn, and the fog bank had been
dissipated by a fresh breeze acting as advance
courier to the rising of the sun. Jack, looking
toward the southwest could also see the object
of his companion’s exultation, and undoubtedly
felt some of the same pleasure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When it gets a bit lighter we’ll have a far distant
view of the city, with its smoke cloud hovering
over it,” he remarked, knowing that soft coal
and southern pine as used for fuel in the Fall
and Winter seasons always caused something of
a pall to mark the site of the river metropolis.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk reached around, and drew forth a case
that on being opened disclosed a pair of pretty
decent binoculars, with which they had been
fitted out by the Washington authorities before
starting on this particular man-hunt, with an
idea that they might prove most useful sooner
or later.</p>

<p class='c013'>After clapping these to his eyes Perk announced
that he could easily pick up the goal
of their flight from Candler Field; although the
smoke did act as a screen, through which it was
not possible to see with certainty.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was now bringing out all the reserve
speed of their ship—it was of some consequence
that they make a landing as early as possible,
since he had no desire to attract undue attention,
and possibly have inquisitive newspaper reporters
to be asking pertinent questions as to
whence they came, what their identities might
be when at home, and also concerning the object
of their coming to New Orleans. Secrecy
was the foundation on which they meant to
build their plans; and from their previous experience
with those dare devils in the employ of
Slippery Slim, too much care could not be employed
in order to mask their batteries.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, too, as they approached the city Jack was
dropping down to lower levels; while on his part
Perk skimmed the whole scene, looking for the
airport they knew to be somewhere within reach
of their vision.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being presently located he called his
chum’s attention to the open field, and in almost
no time they were circling it, looking for the
best place to land.</p>

<p class='c013'>Early though it was there were moving figures
circulating around, while some sort of ship
was coming in from over the river—possibly one
of the air mail carriers from a distant station, it
might be many hundred miles away, fetching
Uncle Sam’s important letter sacks, and worthwhile
express matter, at treble the speed that the
fastest train could muster.</p>

<p class='c013'>The landing was effected without the slightest
difficulty, and hardly had their boat come
to a stop than a number of persons, most of them
connected with the ground force of mechanicians
and hostlers, surrounded the incoming
craft, paying but scant attention to the air mail,
which dropped down almost at the same moment—that
was a daily happening, a following
out of a regular schedule, to which they had
become accustomed; while the arrival of a mysterious
plane might stand for almost anything.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold fast, Perk!” said Jack, as he took off
his headphones, and raising his voice to almost
a shout, so deaf did he appear after a whole
night’s run; “don’t tumble out yet; and keep a
muffler on your gab, for we’ve got to let ’em
take it out in guessing. I’ll soon see if the
party we’re expecting to meet is on hand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He still kept his helmet and goggles in position
as he thrust his head out of the cockpit, and
raising his right hand with two fingers extended,
made a species of salute. A stout man,
with a very red face, and an air of importance,
immediately pushed through the gathering
crowd, and answered Jack’s signal with a similar
sweep of his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s okay, Perk—that’s our party, and he’s
been watching for us, showing he had my wire
last evening. Get a move on, and we’ll soon be
doubling our legs under a breakfast table.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! but that will be a joy to me,
old hoss!” Perk exclaimed; “’cause I’m as
hungry as a wolf, an’ the smell o’ coffee is apt
to set me wild. Go to it, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was paying no attention to these vaporings,
since it was a common occurrence to have
old Perk declare the bottom of his stomach was
in danger of falling out—he had met the red-faced
gentleman and they were shaking hands
as they exchanged a few words.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all fixed, comrade,” he said to Perk over
his shoulder, mentioning no names lest suspicious
ears catch them, and thus have a clue as
to their identity; “we’ll get a few of these boys
to run our boat into a hangar close by, which is
waiting for us, and then cut out for the city—and grub.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This being speedily carried out, with the
doors fastened securely, and the two flyers began
to hastily divest themselves of their working
“duds.” Before ten minutes had passed
they were on their way in a taxi the gentleman
friend had brought out, with Jack and their
host talking at a great rate; while as for Perk
he was looking out, and finding more or less enjoyment
in seeing new and novel sights along
the road.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk having been well coached as to the
necessity for caution, made it a practice to snatch
an occasional glance in their rear, looking for
any signs to indicate that their car was being
trailed; but nothing at all suspicious came to
his attention.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meantime Jack had learned that their new
friend (whose name he already knew to be Mr.
Adkins) was connected with the Administration
forces of the United States District Attorney,
having offices in the Government building—that
he had been secretly advised of their coming
days before receiving Jack’s wire; and was
ready to give them all the information possible
concerning what had been learned in connection
with the wholesale operations of the man they
had been sent out to cage, so as to effectually
remove the greatest menace that had threatened
business men of the Southwest in a decade.</p>

<p class='c013'>In due time he would post them regarding
all these important facts; meanwhile they
could take things easy, for there was no hurry,
and the game was of too much importance to
allow lax methods. When they got good and
ready they could make a start, and after that
everything must depend on their ability to beat
Slippery Slim at his favorite game of “dog eat
dog.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He steered his guests to a certain restaurant
where he knew they could be well taken care
of, and which turned out to be close to the hotel
at which they booked under fictitious names.
Here Perk was given the privilege of ordering
just what he desired along the line of rashers of
bacon and fried eggs; cornbread with syrup;
several cups of coffee taken black; and to top off
with, a Havana cigar such as he was not accustomed
to smoking, being addicted to the more
friendly pipe habit.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no talk of shop while they partook
of breakfast; such business as they had to transact
was of too delicate a nature to be discussed
in a public place, where strangers would be
coming and going, and spying eyes might be on
them every minute of the time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Later they gathered in the room at the hotel
where, behind closed and locked doors they felt
free to confer in lowered tones.</p>

<p class='c013'>Much had to be told, and numerous thrilling
accounts brought out connected with adventures
experienced by other Secret Service men in their
efforts to round up the notorious gang—all of
which had resulted in absolute defeat for the
Government agents.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shrewd men some of these parties undoubtedly
were, with a record of numerous famous
cases successfully carried through; but somehow
when they found themselves up against
Slippery Slim Garrabrant they sooner or later
fell down on the job, and had to be recalled.</p>

<p class='c013'>In fact, it was disclosed to Jack and his pal,
two different agents were never again heard
from, after secret code messages had been received
from them to the effect that they were
even then getting very close to a great discovery
that must end in the arrest of the malefactor—a
dead silence that had never been broken
seemed to signify that they must have fallen into
some sort of fiendish trap, possibly meeting with
a gruesome fate that would be forever shrouded
in blank mystery.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins, watching closely as he narrated
these uncomfortable facts, was pleased to see
that neither of his interested auditors displayed
the least sign of being disturbed, showing that
they had long since discounted everything along
this line.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c014'>CHAPTER IX <br /> <br />COACHING PERK</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Of course it was in keeping with this exchange
of confidences that Jack should relate all that
had happened to them since their arrival in
Atlanta to secure the ship awaiting them, load
it to capacity for a long voyage, and finally start
off from Candler Field.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins listened eagerly to this modest
account of what had already happened to them
as a starter in the hunt they had undertaken;
and he was visibly thrilled at hearing of the
bitter night chase, the desperate tactics undertaken
by the pair of human wolves aboard the
Ryan monoplane; and particularly when Jack
finally described in vivid language the astounding
act of Perk in first shattering the bothersome
searchlight, to follow this with his lucky
random shot that bore into the gas tank of the
pursuing craft and brought about an explosion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Possibly the urbane gentleman had never in
all his life listened to so ghastly a true story as
the graphic one thus modestly related by one
of the two participants; looking at them, with
Jack so calm and modest, giving all the credit
to his grinning accomplice, he must have decided
in his astute mind that at last Slippery
Slim was going to have a pair of human bloodhounds
on his trail such as all his ingenuity and
vindictiveness combined could not throw into
the discard.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me have,” he went on to say to Jack, “as
good a description as possible of those same
bills your friend Scotty found in that pocketbook
dropped among his clothing by the unknown
party whom you believe was looking for
your letter of instructions from Washington.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When Jack complied with this request the
other nodded his head approvingly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question but what they were of the same
stripe as all the others that have been brought to
our attention,” he told Jack. “You must know
it’s been a mooted question as to whether the
plates from which these notes are being printed
in vast quantities (that make it a gold mine for
the gang) are counterfeits engraved by some
master in the art or stolen property, which have
somehow never been missed by the plant where
much of the printing is done for the Treasury
Department—the bills are so perfect that cashiers
and tellers are all at sea over the facts, so
that something of a near panic has resulted in
banking circles as a result of this unknown quantity.
Remember these are the old type of banknotes,
and not the new abbreviated form of currency,
so that it is more difficult to discover the
actual facts.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will all come out in the wash, sir,” remarked
Perk, sagaciously, with a sly wink at
his pal.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, Perk,” observed the gentlemanly official,
smilingly; “but I’m more concerned about
your plan of campaign than anything else right
now. During the time you stop over here in
Orleans I mean to keep you posted with regard
to any fresh news that comes in to Headquarters
for there is hardly a day when we do not learn
of additional discoveries connected with this deluge
of phony money that’s been dumped on the
whole Southwest by this hard working gang.
I am telling you everything that’s known or suspected,
so that you can figure out your best line
of action.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We understand that, Mr. Adkins,” said Jack,
nodding, “and you can rest assured we appreciate
your kindness more than I can tell you.
Before we jump off you will know what we’ve
decided to do, so as to pick up a warm trail;
and after that, sir, don’t be worried if you fail
to hear a single word from us for days, weeks,
or even months; but depend upon it we’ll be
working on the job every minute.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And never forget, I beg of you, that this
man is a devil for cruelty and craftiness—I’m
sure you’ll not delude yourselves that his arrest
will be an easy task; for as good men as were
ever on the roll of our Secret Service Department
have fallen down on the job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you again, sir, for your warning; but
we’re not meaning to feel anything like over-confidence,
so as to let the bars down. I understand
from my having been picked to take up
this case, that the knowledge of myself and my
assistant here along the line of aviation cut a big
figure in the appointment, since it has been
learned that Slim himself makes use of a flying
boat possibly to cross over from the wilds of
Mexico, it being suspected he has his plant
hidden away somewhere among the mountains,
where he doubtless keeps peace with the authorities
by paying tribute that insures his being left
undisturbed. We hope to change all that sooner
or later, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I admire your modesty, Jack,” continued the
Government official, who had warmed toward
the pair during the short time he had known
them, and seemed to take a personal interest in
their fortunes. “Remember to keep in touch
with Headquarters while in the city, so as to
notify me in case you need any assistance—I can
later on place a posse of oldtime Texas Rangers
at your service, if the occasion arises for a necessity
to show force—they are now working for
the Government as border patrols, and as you
can understand, are the same rough-riding, fearless
type that played such a leading figure in
the early history of the Lone Star State; for we
have authority that covers such matters. And
I’ll be one of the first to extend you my hearty
congratulations should you win out, and bring
in your man; as I’ve no doubt your good pal
here used to do when, as you’ve told me, he used
to work with the Canadian Mounted Police
force, in years gone by.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It won’t be our fault, sir, if we make a flop
o’ the job,” asserted Perk, who believed he ought
to get in an occasional word; although there
were a good many things he did not wholly
understand, and which he would depend on
Jack to further explain when opportunity arose.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins shook them both cordially by the
hand, and took his departure, leaving them to
digest all the startling facts he had placed in
their possession. By slow degrees they would
figure things out, and sketch their plan of operation;
then would come the hour when once more
they must depend on their wings to carry them
many hundreds of miles toward the scene of
action, where the air would be surcharged with
dynamite, while deadly enemies might be lying
in ambush, ready to take them by surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk started to spring his questions, and Jack
was only too glad to make the necessary explanations;
for it was necessary that they work in
complete harmony if they hoped to be successful.</p>

<p class='c013'>As far as they had gone, things looked hopeful
to Jack, as he marshalled the facts that had
lately been placed in their possession. He was
satisfied that when every item had been arranged
in its rightful sequence they could fashion a
plan of campaign that would at least have a
better chance for winning out than any of those
utilized by former detectives, who had not possessed
the essential wings so as to meet Slippery
Slim on his own chosen ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No tellin’ just how long we’ll stick it out in
this burgh, I guess, buddy?” suggested Perk,
some time later, as they continued to take things
easy, resting up after a hard night’s flight, and
meaning to get around the city after noon and
lunch time had come and passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Couldn’t say as yet, Perk; we’ve got to comb
out the stuff as handed over by our new friend,
Mr. Adkins, and discard everything that doesn’t
pan out as being worth while. Then there were
a few leaders he dropped that, if followed up,
might turn out to be leading clues, the possession
of which would possibly turn the tide of battle.
I’m meaning not to let anything make me show
undue speed—Rome wasn’t built in a day, we’ve
got to recollect, and so shape things from the
standpoint of ‘safety first’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! that’s the boy!” gurgled the pleased
Perk; “me, don’t I remember that story o’ the
hare an’ the tortoise runnin’ a race, which the
turtle won ’cause he never even stopped to rest
up; while the rabbit, thinkin’ he could run loops
around such a plodder, lay down to take a nap,
overslept himself, and when he got to the goal
there was Old Leatherback awaitin’ to turn the
big laugh on him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk wound up with one of his rollicking
laughs; everything seemed to create merriment
in his soul just now, after that royal breakfast;
though perhaps he was running away ahead of
the dry facts, and counting his chickens before
they were hatched out of the shell. But Perk
was confident the sly fox of a Slim would find
himself snagged in the net one of these days,
and the clever guy who handled things would
turn out to be an aviator and sky detective named
Jack Ralston.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack some time afterwards, had just aroused
from a short nap, when Perk, who had been
pondering and grumbling to himself, tossed out
another question, as if to disclose what was
troubling him:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it, old hoss, do you b’lieve them
dicks we left behind after they’d floated down
from a high ceilin’ with their chutes, got outen
the scrape, so they could a hiked to some nearby
village or town, an’ took the first train headed
for Orleans, reckonin’ we must a’been on the
jump thisaways?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say the chances all point that way, Perk,”
Jack told him, without the slightest hesitation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jumpin’ crickets! if that’s a fact why, a feller
might run acrost the slick pair any old minute—meet
’em right face to face!” Perk went on to
say, as if the fact gave him more or less concern.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose then you’d recognize the chappies
with just one look, eh, what about that, partner?”
asked Jack, laughingly; at which the other
grinned a bit foolishly, to admit he had serious
doubts on that score.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! didn’t either o’ us get a peep-in at
their monikers, worse luck—had them helmets
and goggles in place right away, like they didn’t
mean to give us a single look-in. S’pose now
they got the high sign on us boys?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“On a venture I’d say that was always possible,”
replied Jack, soberly; for this very point
had occurred to him, and was as yet unsettled
in his mind. “Nobody knows how long they may
have been in Atlanta—Mr. Adkins assured us
Slim seemed to have all sorts of strings out, so
as to learn in advance of any bunch of Government
agents taking the field against his giant
bogus money monopoly; and for all we can tell
those two may have been spying on us most
of the time we were around Candler Field, getting
our ship ready to take to the air.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Rotten luck, I’m sayin’, and too much one-sided
to suit me,” growled Perk, frowning savagely.
“Here we got to do our work in the
dark; while that smart cuss holds all the high
cards in the pack, an’ c’n trump our ace any
time he takes a notion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No need to worry about that, comrade,” said
Jack, soothingly. “You must remember that
when we move along we mean to disappear as
if heading into the thickest belt of pea soup fog
ever seen—in that way they’ll lose all trace of
us, and we can play our cards as we choose, making
up for a different breed of sky travelers, so
as to dope the cleverest kind of spies he can send
out. While they’re left guessing what’s become
of us we’ll be doing our little tracking job, and
hour by hour, day after day, keep on creeping
closer to their secret stronghold, wherever that
may prove to be. Those are some of the things
we figured on doing, Perk, don’t forget.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The one addressed made no reply, but as he
let his head fall back, as if he meant to pick up
a few winks of sleep, there came a look of rapt
admiration on his weather-beaten face that bespoke
the utmost confidence in his best pal.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c014'>CHAPTER X <br /> <br />LAYING PLANS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>After a noonday lunch Jack and his partner
spent most of the afternoon in carrying out the
various duties that were seemingly on their program.
Among other things Jack visited the
Federal building, and was closeted for more
than an hour with Mr. Adkins.</p>

<p class='c013'>The latter official had conceived a great fancy
for young Ralston, and went to no end of trouble
so as to post him with regard to what he was
likely to run up against while endeavoring to
close in on Slippery Slim. With his accustomed
sagacity Jack made notes of some of the
facts thus laid before him; but since these were
in shorthand, and would be utterly unintelligible
to any outside party, should they chance
to fall into enemy hands, there was no danger
that any mischief would follow.</p>

<p class='c013'>By degrees he was filling up with scraps of
description, and everything connected with
former attempts at locating the hideout, where
all this unlawful scrip was being turned off the
press, to flood the Southwest.</p>

<p class='c013'>That was always his way of doing—when
given a tough job Jack would live alongside it,
breathing the very atmosphere of the undertaking,
until he found himself sympathetic with the
aims and ambitions of the criminals whose apprehension
was placed on his shoulders by his
Big Boss.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll have dinner early, Perk,” he told the
other, who had been carrying out a number of
special duties while Jack was busy elsewhere,
“so as to retire to our room at the hotel. No
going out after nightfall for us just at present,
especially in a strange city, where some sneak
might waylay us coming back from the theater.
All that sort of pleasure must be put out of our
heads just at present.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! guess you’re hittin’ the nail on the
head, old hoss, when you say that,” grunted
Perk, who very probably had already picked out
just the screen play he wanted so badly to see;
but he was a good scout, and able to put duty
above pleasure, when the occasion arose for
making a personal sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another thing,” continued Jack, “there’s no
telling what night flying we’re bound to be up
against, in trying to keep our movements secret;
so it’d be wise for us both to enjoy all the extra
sleep that comes our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, partner,” assented Perk, subordinating
his desires to the slogan which he knew
was Jack’s watchword—“safety first”. “When
I’ve stowed away all the grub I c’n hold mebbe
I’ll be ready to hit the hay, to stick it out till
cock-crow around daylight—an’ then some.
Pretty fair sleeper, they always called me across
the big pond—crawl out as the last horn was
blowin’, rub my eyes a bit, get aboard my fightin’
crate, an’ step off to knock another Heine pilot
down afore botherin’ ’bout my breakfast—all in a
day’s doings with Gabe Perkiser. Sabbe that,
partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I know you like a book,” Jack told him
with a smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get a bellyfull when you had that confab
with Mr. Adkins?” demanded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m filled up to the brim with all kinds of
material, which by degrees I’ll have to sort out,
keeping only what strikes me as essential,” came
the answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see—sorter separatin’ the chaff from the
wheat,” mused Perk; “an’ if it’s a fair question,
old hoss, which way do we head when we take
off?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You might call it due northeast,” Jack told
him; and then, as his companion uttered a
startled exclamation, as though vastly surprised,
Jack gave a quick glance around as if to make
certain that no one was dogging their footsteps,
after which he lowered his voice almost to a
whisper, to add: “but that would be only for a
<i>blind</i>, in case hostile eyes were watching our
departure from the flying field; for after we’ve
cleared a dozen or more miles we can make a
complete circle, and point the nose of our boat
squarely west!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good boy!” snapped the relieved Perk;
“sounds a heap more like it. You sure did
throw a big scare into me, Jack, ’cause it’d been
’bout settled ’tween us that the game had ought
to be played out there in the boundless waste
spaces around the border.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, everything points that way so far,” he
was assured; “but no more talkie at present,
Perk—we’ll keep bottled up until inside four
walls, where no spy can steal our thunder.
Slim’s knocked the underpinning away from a
bunch of fine schemes looking to his undoing,
simply by finding out what the big game happened
to be, and then bursting the bubble by a
scoop. We don’t intend to dish our business
that way if it can be helped.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wall,” drawled Perk, with his best Yankee
effect, “guess not if we know our stuff, an’ c’n
roll our hoop.”</p>

<p class='c013'>As they walked along toward their hotel Perk
kept up a constant lookout, as though endeavoring
to make some more or less thrilling discovery—never
a man, black or white, did they meet
but that he was made the object of a severe
scrutiny by the suspicious one; however, they
reached their objective without his having run
across any reason for making a decision; and
shortly afterwards they were securely lodged in
their room, the door locked, and a couple of easy
chairs inviting them to take things comfortable,
which they lost no time in doing, being wearied
from so much trotting about—flying men as a
rule not enjoying a reputation for pedestrian
feats.</p>

<p class='c013'>A long and serious confab followed, both
speaking in low tones; Jack on his part explained
the mass of information he had accumulated,
and answered the flood of questions asked
by his comrade, as well as he was able; until he
found a chance to go deeper into things himself
he could not make definite statements concerning
a number of points that were a bit hazy, and
needed confirmation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus the afternoon waned, and the time came
when they were ready to think of the essential
“eats”. Of course it was Perk who brought this
subject up, for he chanced to have a tremendous
appetite, and was apt to give considerable time
to figuring what his next <i>menu</i> would be—indeed,
half the enjoyment in his estimation lay in
thus building air castles along the line of “grub”.</p>

<p class='c013'>Remembering that little episode up in Atlanta,
where some unknown party had made such
a “rat’s nest” of Scotty’s adjoining room, evidently
under a mistaken belief it belonged to
himself and Perk, Jack made sure to carry all
his important papers on his person, properly secured,
so that no deft hand of a sneak thief could
negotiate their abstraction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All ready, partner,” he told Perk, at the time
looking out of the window, holding back the
curtains to see the better who chanced to be
walking along the opposite pavement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never said sweeter words than them, old
boy; I sure was close to faintin’, my tummy
feelin’ like the bottom was adroppin’ out—soup
an’ such soft stuffs, while fillin’ at the time don’t
stay with me any great while—I crave solids
mostly. On your way then, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had marshalled all the facts that had
been placed in his possession, weeded a few out
as worthless, and by the time their discussion
ended had told his companion that the Finger
of Destiny was pointing out their future course
as lying over the almost boundless plains of
Texas, across New Mexico, and deep into Arizona
deserts, to the wild country along the border
not far distant from the spot at which the
Gila river forms a junction with the larger Colorado;
where the latter serves as a watery boundary
line between Arizona and Southeastern California,
with Old Mexico less than thirty miles
distant as the crow flies.</p>

<p class='c013'>It would be a big jump for them, but the flood
of bad currency undoubtedly had its start somewhere
in this hostile region, and spread out like
an open fan, northwest into San Diego and Los
Angeles—northward up to Salt Lake City—and
in the northeast as far as Oklahoma. To
effectually break it up it was necessary that they
go to the fountain head, so as to destroy the very
roots of the noisome poison ivy plant.</p>

<p class='c013'>They spent more than half an hour dining,
and needless to say Perk enjoyed himself to his
heart’s content—who wouldn’t if he had a pocketfull
of ready cash, furnished by a bountiful
Uncle Sam; a bill of fare bristling with all kinds
of tempting dishes such as Perk doted on; and
to complete the combination having been born
with a healthy, unbridled appetite?</p>

<p class='c013'>It was just commencing to get dusk when they
emerged from the restaurant and started back to
the hotel, some two blocks distant. Perk, as
usual, kept turning his head this way and that
very much like a wolf scalp-hunter looking for
his suspicious quarry. Presently he picked at
Jack’s sleeve, and bending his head until his lips
almost touched the other’s ear he observed in a
sibilant whisper!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen, partner—we got a clam doggin’ us
like a bloodhound on the track o’ a runaway nigger
from a convict camp back in Alabam—get
that, do you?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c014'>CHAPTER XI <br /> <br />THE NIGHT ALARM</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>“I’m not thrilled by what you say, Perk, because
I’ve been more than half expecting to hear
that discovery. Glad you got on to him okay;
because it’s always best to know what’s in the
wind. What sort of a chap is he like?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack spoke in his usual calm way, and the other
realized he had undoubtedly been prepared for
the sudden news.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ out o’ the way ’bout his looks, far as
I c’n see,” was Perk’s reply; “on’y got a few
squints at the guy; but he’s keepin’ tab o’ our
movements I guess now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Reckon he might be one of those lads in the
Ryan ship that crashed in flames after they’d
flown the coop?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! just can’t be dead sure, partner,”
chuckled Perk; “but there’s somethin’ ’bout his
walk that gets me into believin’ he’s the <i>kiwi</i>
that pilot was keepin’ on our tail so long, stickin’
like a leech from a mud-hole.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder,” the other went on to say, as if
talking to himself; “if that’s the case then, both
those duffers pulled through with their lives, and
not so badly hurt. Honestly I’m a bit glad that’s
so, for up to the present I’ve never had occasion
to take a human life.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk snorted on hearing this.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if so be you’d been ten years older, my
boy, mebbe you’d not be able to say that—chances
are you’d a been mixed up in that mess across the
Atlantic, when Yanks an’ Johnny Rebs were
fightin’ shoulder to shoulder, and it was a case o’
a Heine pilot’s life or our’n. But if you keep
on with Uncle Sam’s service as you’re adoin’
right now, the time’ll come for you to fetch back
a dead man who jest <i>wouldn’t</i> let hisself be captured.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Like as not,” remarked Jack; “but there’s no
need of crossing a river till you come to it; so
I’m not taking trouble by the forelock away
ahead of time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’ll we do ’bout this dickey bird that’s
bobbin’ at our heels so gaily, tell me, partner?”
pursued Perk, eagerly, as though in his fighting
heart he was actually hoping his superior would
give the order to turn on their persistent pursuer,
and at least blacken both his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! nothing at all, Perk; let him run his
rope; only we’ll keep along streets where there’s
plenty of company, and be prepared for any sort
of ambush; though I can’t believe he’d be crazy
enough to start anything so early in the evening—if
the hour was close to midnight, things
might be different. There are any number of
tough cases in this old Creole city ready to handle
a sticking game for the coin in it—blacks and
yellows and whites it doesn’t matter which—all
of them are assassins at heart.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then you don’t care if he shadows us straight
to the hotel?” demanded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Much good that will do him.” said Jack with
a light laugh; “the chances are two to one he
already knows where we’ve put up, and has had
some spy dog me to the Federal building. When
the time comes for us to jump off we’ll find a
slick way to hop our ship without giving these
boys a show-down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently they arrived at the hotel entrance,
without any untoward incident arising to mar
the quiet of the evening. Perk cast a parting
glance toward their rear just before entering,
and seeing the shadowy figure hovering not far
away, considered it a part of his duty to place
his thumb to his nose, and wiggle his fingers
derisively, at the same time uttering a snarl like
a bobcat at bay, to express his utter contempt.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once in their room, Jack first of all cast about
as if to decide whether any uninvited guest had
intruded on their preserves while they were absent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything seems to be just as we left it,”
he told his running mate, after making this little
survey, “and even if some busybody did get in
here with the aid of a pass-key borrowed from a
chambermaid, he was shrewd enough not to mess
things up like they did with our friend Scotty
of the air mail bunch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess now they must acome to the conclusion
you keep the letter o’ instructions ’bout your
person,” suggested Perk, wisely, “which, bein’
the case mebbe now they figger on sneakin’ in
here while we’re sound asleep, an’ agoin’ through
your clothes in regulation style. They do tell me
there be sneak thieves right clever in this same
burgh, equal to the ones out in India, where they
c’n steal the sheet from under a sleeper, without
wakin’ him up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I understand that’s really true, partner,” Jack
agreed; “but we’re not going to let them have
half a chance, even if they hired all the crooks
in New Orleans to play the game.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sounds good to me, boss,” Perk declared.
“We’ll manage to sleep with one eye open, an’
if any critter tries to give us the once over, he’ll
wish he’d never been born, that’s all I know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Before turning in, Jack placed a chair so nicely
balanced that in case of the door being ever so
slightly opened it would crash to the floor, making
enough noise to arouse the Seven Sleepers.
Perk grinned at seeing him prepare this “guardian
angel” as he termed it, and lost no time himself
in “hitting the hay.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Some time later in the night, when outside
noises had almost died away, there came a loud
clatter that awoke both the sleepers instantly.
They bounced out on the floor in their pajamas,
with Jack pulling the cord he had attached to
the electric bulb, so that the room was magically
illuminated.</p>

<p class='c013'>The chair lay on its side, and just beyond Perk
could see that their door was partly open; the
key had been left in the lock, but skillful fingers
must have manipulated it by means of
slender-jawed pliers, showing the touch of a professional
thief.</p>

<p class='c013'>Straight toward the door the form of Perk was
projected—a hungry lion could hardly have
made a more pronounced leap at some four-legged
game which he had been stalking.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tearing open the door still wider, Perk thrust
out his head, and looked up and down the hotel
corridor. He fancied he could make out a dim
figure far along the poorly lighted hall, but it
vanished like a phantom even as he stared, evidently
turning some corner.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there were other sounds arising—doors
all along the corridor were opening, and heads
being projected, showing how the startling alarm
had awakened numerous other sleepers, who
may have imagined an earthquake was in process
of occurring, though such a happening was utterly
foreign to the metropolis on the Lower Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c013'>Voices, too, were heard, from both masculine
as well as feminine sources, as the aroused hotel
guests endeavored to fathom the real meaning
of the row.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, seeing there was nothing doing, closed
the door, and locked it again; after which he
turned to his companion who had been watching
his actions with more or less amusement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Consarn his picture,” growled the old fighter;
“he got off scot free; I jest glimpsed him
aturnin’ the first bend down the hall. Blamed
shame I couldn’t come to grips with the yeller
cub—I’d a given a heap to twist his neck
some, you bet I would. Mebbe now I’d otter sit
up the rest o’ the night to make certain, eh,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not the slightest need of such a thing, partner,”
Jack assured him. “I’ll fix that door so it
won’t be opened again in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c013'>With that he again took the stout chair, and
placed it diagonally against the door, so that its
top rested just under the knob; after that had
been accomplished it must needs be a battering-ram
that could burst in on them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not content with that, Jack went to each of
the two windows, thrust out his head to examine
for the second time the face of the outer wall of
the building so as to make sure there was no
ledge wide enough to give a would-be trespasser
foothold.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not the ghost of a chance for the most nimble
thief to get in by way of a window, Perk, so
back to bed we go, and sleep like babes in the
wood for we’re in the third story and far enough
from a fire escape to be secure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk grinned and nodded acquiescence; truth
to tell he was not at all averse to starting all over
again—possibly the rude interruption had disturbed
him just when he was starting to partake
of a royal feast that covered every one of his most
beloved dishes and he was hugging the delusion
to his heart that if given another chance history
might repeat itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>At least there was no further alarm, and the
night passed into oblivion like all its countless
predecessors with the rising sun arousing the
two comrades, and Perk as usual singing out
that he felt as though he could easily manage two
customary breakfasts in that delighful restaurant
where they were already feeling so much at
home.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c014'>CHAPTER XII <br /> <br />PLAYING WITH FIRE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>During the morning Jack took a taxi and paid
another visit to the offices in the government
building where Mr. Adkins had his desk, doing
his daily stunt under the direction of the U. S.
District Attorney and other officials in the service
of Uncle Sam.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, also, had his job laid out for him, which
was to circulate around until he felt positive he
had thrown off any possible spy after which it
was his duty to make certain purchases, following
the list Jack had given him, have them all
sent to the aviation field in charge of the man
Mr. Adkins had placed on guard at the hangar
containing their ship and thus completing the
stock of supplies necessary for their long flight
and survey work.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk carried out his instructions to the letter,
and with great vim, since the fact of their laying
in these stores was a positive indication that
things were coming to pass insuring a speedy
getaway and <i>Action</i> was what had come to be
the greatest asset in life to Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>They met again at noon in their eating place,
where, choosing an isolated corner table they
could discuss their plan of campaign, even while
attending to the wants of the inner man.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk made his report, which the other seemed
to find good, judging from his frequent nods of
acquiescence and when the story had been told
to the last word, Perk felt it was his turn to
learn things.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess now you got the last batch o’ information
from His Nibs, Jack?” he hastened to
ask, expectantly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sure did, partner,” he was told. “A few
scraps of fresh news that’d be likely to interest
us had drifted in since I saw Mr. Adkins last,
which he passed along to me. I’ll sort these
shreds over later, and fix them where they belong.
So far as I can see now they corroborate
what we’ve already been so strongly believing
must be a fact.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which means, I guess, boss, we head west?”
ventured Perk, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Into the setting sun—that’s right, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do we still expect to keep in touch with Mr.
Adkins, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whenever the chance opens up, and we have
any important news to send along or want to
know certain things, perhaps even to call on him
for that bunch of old-time Texas Rangers he
said he could turn over to us if we found any
use for them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be!” said Perk, plainly excited, “I
sure do hope that emergency does bob up, ’cause
I’d give my last Mex dollar to glimpse them
rearin’, tearin’ ole fighters knockin’ spots outen
the bunch o ’lawless ringers Slippery Slim’s
gathered around him. Chances are they’d skip
out like hot fleas soon as they heard the ol’time
battle cry o’ the defenders o’ the Rio Grande in
the days when cattle rustlers raided the ranches
down Texas way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But we’ve got to remember,” cautioned
Jack, “that these chaps are like lean hungry
wolves, that never leave the trail of a wounded
stag as long as they can crawl along. I’m not
fancying we’ve pulled the wool over their eyes
so far and that fact was brought to my attention
just after I got back from conferring with
Mr. Adkins.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As how, boss?” queried the curious Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t just know what influenced me after
I’d entered the hotel, to step back and look out
again,” explained Jack. “There was the driver
of my taxi, the trusty who’d been recommended
by the clerk at the desk, talking earnestly with
an unknown party and even as I watched I saw
him thrust a bank note into the chauffeur’s itching
hand, showing that he has been corrupted
and is in cohoot with our enemies.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! is it so rotten bad as all that, partner?”
bleated the disgusted Perk, “All I c’n
say is I sure do hope it was a nice brand new five-dollar
bill he handed over to the yeller dog, an’
that it’s agoin’ to turn out to be a sample o’ their
bogus money outfit. Serve the slick renegade if
he got hisself pulled in for passin’ a counterfeit
note on some guy that ain’t goin’ to sit by and
take what’s comin’ to him without raisin’ a nice
howl.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t be too vindictive, Perk,” Jack told
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, partner, ever see the boob afore?” the
other demanded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you mean the chap who was pumping my
driver for all that was out, Perk, I can’t say
that I have. He was a flashily dressed man,
with loud clothes that would stamp him as a
gambler, like those who used to travel on these
Mississippi River steamboats in the old days before
the Civil War, fleecing unsuspecting passengers
out of all their money and I haven’t
the least doubt but what he’s a member of the
very gang we’re expecting to round up. Mr.
Adkins told me it was simply amazing the vastness
of the combine Slippery Slim’s managed to
gather around him but he was certain it must
number many scores of workers, all obeying the
orders of the mainspring—crooked Slim Garrabrant.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! the more you keep on tellin’ me them
big stories, Jack, the happier it all makes me
’cause I seem to just know there’s bound to be a
heap o’ rough house stuff croppin’ up, to cool
my blood, ragin’ hot just now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some fine day you’ll be rubbing up against
enough fighting to make you call quits with the
game. Perk, my boy; and it’s just likely to crop
up before long if indications count for anything.
I felt pretty sure from his swagger that
this fellow might be the very same master mind
in charge of that Ryan boat—then, too, when he
walked away he had a little limp, which might
have come from striking the ground so hard
after his chute let him down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Darned pity he didn’t break a leg, or even
his measly ol’ neck, I’d say,” grumbled Perk, one
of his fits of resentment gripping him just then.
“Got no use for these treacherous snakes that
squirm, and worm their way into the confidence
o’ honest gents, on’y to play a low-down trick,
an’ fill their pockets with smackers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s one thing we’ve got to guard
against,” suggested Jack, who seemed to have a
faculty for looking at every side of a picture,
and anticipating troubles that might never have
occurred to others less gifted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As what, partner?” asked Perk, brightening
up once more.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Delay is what they may be hoping for—some
way to hold us here while important news is
carried to headquarters. I can even see how
they might make some sort of ridiculous charge
against us to the police, in hopes we would be
held several days under suspicion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk looked astonished.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But see here, boss, we got our credentials
from Washington to prove we’re in the Secret
Service, an’ sky detectives at that; they jest
wouldn’t dare hold us on some sorter flimsy
charge ’cause that’d get ’em in hard with the
Government, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never know how these affairs may turn
out,” said Jack. “Often there seems to be some
kind of a jealous feeling between States officers
and those of the Government—almost like a little
vendetta, each arm of the Law striking out
at the other, and getting in a sly lick that’s good
for a laugh after hostilities have died down.
These Southern city police might make out
there was a grave charge of abduction or something
like that, compelling them to hold us <i>incommunicado</i>—that
is keep us from intercourse
with the U. S. District Attorney’s office until
several days had elapsed and then setting us
free with a lot of apologies that didn’t mean anything
whatsoever.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! I get your drift partner,” said Perk,
frowning. “We sure can’t afford to spend any
of our valuable time in the hoosgow here, if we
c’n help it. ’Cause things set that way I hope
you get busy an’ fix it so we’ll shake the dust o’
this same burgh off our shoes in a hurry. Got
the date settled yet, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shook hands with, and said goodbye to Mr.
Adkins this morning, Perk and you are at
liberty to figure that out as you please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it’s <i>tonight</i>?” asked the other, looking
well satisfied with such an enticing programme.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wind and weather permitting we’ll clear out
soon after twilight settles down on the city and
the river,” Jack assured his understudy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me, I’m sittin’ pretty, an’ taking things as
they come along, old hoss,” continued Perk.
“Let’s perambulate and attend to the crying
needs of this high noon hour—the girl told me
they expected to have apple dumplings for lunch
today an’ that’s one I’d nominate as bein’ among
my prime favorites—you know I got a <i>few</i> I
really enjoy an’ that’s no lie either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I know a good many on your list—fact
is,” said frank Jack, “if I ran down the whole
menu this noon there’d be only a scant few that’s
missed being called your especial favorites each
in its turn as the wind blew. But just as well
we did all the eating while the chance lasts, for
only a magician can tell what our bill of fare is
going to be during the coming week or two—some
weird dishes most likely—boiled owl,
fried rattlesnake, baked prairie dog—Heaven
knows to what ends we may be reduced.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have a heart, partner, don’t take my healthy
appetite away by mentionin’ them terrible
dishes. ’Member you promised we’d hire a taxi
after lunch, an’ drive all around the city, lampin’
the big sights like the French market, the queer
buryin’ places where holes in thick walls take
the place o’ graves, on ’count o’ there bein’ so
much water in the ground, with the city settin’
so low down, an’ the ol’ Mississippi on one o’
its benders. Then I want to eat Gulf oysters
an’ shrimp at one o’ them cute little stands we
noticed yesterday afternoon; try a reg’lar Creole
dinner tonight at that place Mr. Adkins told us
about—after which I’m all done with Orleans,
an’ ready to pull up stakes for keeps.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll keep that to the last, Perk, and go to
the flying field from the eating house by taxi.
From that time on we’ll have to depend on our
own heads and hands to keep us out of difficulties.
But let’s hope we can climb up to a three
thousand foot ceiling, and strike out as if we
were aiming for Savannah or Jacksonville, only
to swing around inside of half an hour, climb
high over the city and river and put for the
Texas border at full speed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This enchanting program gave Perk much
cause for rejoicing and he sat down at their regular
table in the restaurant feeling, as he expressed
it, “happy as a clam at high tide” and
full of little laughs that seemed to gurgle up
from his shoes.</p>

<p class='c013'>They chatted of other happenings, not wishing
to “talk shop” in such a crowded place, lest
listening ears pick up certain information that
could be used greatly to their disadvantage—Perk
had an endless fund of interesting reminiscences
that, told in his inimitable fashion,
were a never failing source of joy to the appreciative
air pilot.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was spent in motoring all
around the most interesting portions of the city,
the obliging Mr. Adkins having made out a list
of subjects they should not miss seeing while on
this first visit to the justly famous Louisiana metropolis.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIII <br /> <br />THE HOP-OFF</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Leaving the hotel, after settling their account,
and still making use of the taxi with its accommodating
driver, Jack and his comrade had
taken what small amount of hand luggage they
possessed along with them, not meaning to come
back again.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Adkins had recommended a small but
unique restaurant run by a buxom French madame,
where they could have a Creole supper,
such as would long haunt their memories as a
genuine treat and it was to this place they ordered
their driver to convey them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both of them felt fairly convinced they had
been shadowed during the afternoon, although
so carefully must this have been accomplished
they had no positive proof to make it what Perk
would term a “dead certainty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They really did have a delightful “feed,” and
the dishes set before them were as a rule complete
mysteries although the obliging madame,
seeing they were tasting her triumphs of the
French <i>chef’s</i> art for the first time, gladly explained
the nature of the food they consumed
with so much gusto.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was fascinated with his supper, and inwardly
vowed that this should not be the last time
he would partake of tasty Creole dishes. This
duty fulfilled, they faced the next progressive
step in their night’s program—making for
the aviation field, and boarding their ship for
a speedy takeoff, their ultimate goal neither of
them could say just where, save that if all went
well they expected to be somewhere along the
California border within the next few days.</p>

<p class='c013'>The taxi was waiting, with the chauffeur on
the alert. He had already been advised of the
fact that they anticipated having some parties
attempt to spy upon them as evening settled
down and on this account he had maintained a
strict watch for troublesome visitors who might
even attempt to threaten him with bodily injury
unless he agreed to enter into their plans for
delaying the flight of the two flyers, as he knew
his passengers to be from what he had been told.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I see our taxi’s still on deck, partner,”
observed Perk, just as if he might have suspected
they would find it missing, with a detail of grim
city police waiting to escort them to the lockup,
they to be held in durance vile until serious
charges against them could be sifted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing came along to bother you, Henri?”
asked Jack of the smiling driver, who laughed
as he said in reply:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I haf seen one beeg hulk of ze man hanging
around, M’sieu, and looking as if he would like
to eat me up but me, I haf been an old soldier
in the Grand Army of France, and I think he did
not like the way I throw my chest out thees way,
and walk as eef I am on guard duty; he did not
address a single word to me, but just a little
while ago he disappear—I think he may haf
gone to get more courage out of ze glass.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good boy, Henri,” said the grinning Perk,
clapping a hand on the stalwart chauffeur’s
shoulder; “for myself I should not like to tackle
you when you have your fighting face all set.
Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So they were off, and heading out in the direction
of the aviation grounds, with the first shadows
of approaching evening gathering around
them. Perk may have been more or less nervous,
in anticipation of something coming to pass that
would seriously cripple their plans for a speedy
flight, since he kept turning his head from side
to side and scrutinizing every one they saw upon
the streets they traversed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Henri maintained a fairly good speed, all the
law would permit, so that few cars passed them
on the road. Perk managed to watch closely,
and never a motor came booming along in their
wake, honking to announce the driver’s intention
to pass by, than he had his eyes glued on the car
and continued to pay strict attention until it
had crept well up ahead.</p>

<p class='c013'>But after all nothing out of the way came to
pass, and eventually they reached the aviation
field where they found lights already in play,
since a delayed air mail ship was hovering over
signaling for better illumination. There was
some small damage in regard to the steering
gear, making it a bit risky to try a landing unless
the field was brilliantly lighted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You made an arrangement with a couple of
the ground force to hang around so as to help
us get the crate out okay, didn’t you, Perk?”
queried Jack, as they drew up close to the particular
hangar where they had seen their plane
placed in quarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, I sure did, Jack,” the other replied.
“Must be they’re over where that crate hanging
overhead means to land—somethin’ wrong mebbe
but they gimme their word to stay around
till we got here—there, I c’n lamp the guys
runnin’ thisaways right now, so it’s okay, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I see them coming,” returned the other,
himself a bit relieved, since the intended departure
was a most important episode in their plans,
and to meet with any sort of a setback would
be most aggravating indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The two mechanicians quickly arrived, the
hanger was unlocked and opened so as to permit
the exit of the ship. First of all both flyers
hastened to don their working togs, then fasten
on the ’chutes with the harness necessary for the
purpose, all working smoothly and finally clapping
their helmets on their heads, with the earflaps
secured to keep things in readiness for any
emergency that might crop up.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being accomplished, Jack gave the word
to have the heavy ship dragged out into the open.
He knew that his assistant would have looked
after everything essential to their comfort during
the coming flight for Perk was one of those
dependable fellows who carry out orders with
machine-like regularity.</p>

<p class='c013'>A few parties had hastened up to see what
was going on but so far as Perk could tell they
were either workers connected with the field, or
else visitors from the city, who had lingered to
watch the landing of the air mail, so as to tell
how it was done when they reached their several
homes, to partake of a late supper.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now the ship had been swung around so as
to head into the west, since the soft evening breeze
was coming from that quarter and everything
seemed in readiness for the take-off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, still surveying his surroundings as if
still cherishing a fragment of his former suspicions
that all might not be as lovely as surface
indications would announce, started to climb
aboard. Jack on his part was handing some
money to the two men, not wishing to leave a
single thing unpaid when passing out from New
Orleans—there was nothing to be done about
their use of the hangar, since Mr. Adkins had
assured him that matter had already been taken
care of, regardless of how long they chose to
linger in the Crescent City.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, too, cast a last glance around, just as he
would have done had he still been with the air
mail service and about to start off on his customary
night flight with the north-bound sacks
of letters and the express matter that vent along.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just then he heard Perk give vent to a hurried
exclamation:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get aboard, partner; I guess the measly critters
are acomin’ down on us like hot cakes right
now. Lookit how they start arunnin’ thisaway,
will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did not bother looking, as every second
might be valuable; he climbed aboard with alacrity,
and settled down in his seat; at the same time
calling out to the helpers to stand aside. Then
he pulled the gun, with the motor responding
instantly, so well had Perk done his work when
checking up the ship that morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was still glueing his eyes on the several
figures now racing madly in their general direction,
and waving their arms wildly; no doubt
they had started to shout in addition, but the
descending air mail crate was making more or
less racket, which, added to by their own motor’s
thunder, prevented any one from hearing what
they may have been whooping.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was trembling with an excess of emotion—evidently
they had just escaped “by the
skin of their teeth,” for he felt certain he could
distinguish the uniforms of the police in the
little bunch of runners.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Played your hand just a mite too late, gents!”
Perk was whooping as he in turn waved a mocking
adieu backward; “thought you’d ketch a
weasel asleep, I guess, but not so easy, you gate
crashers. Wow! here we go spinnin’ along like
the wind, and it’s goodnight to the bunch. Huh!
shootin’ at us, air you—jest awastin’ ammunition,
that’s all, boys. Go ’way back an’ sit down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Jack lifted her in an upward fling, and
they were off like a startled hawk!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIV <br /> <br />SKIRTING THE GULF</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There was some shooting going on back there,
for although of course the watchful Perk failed
to catch the sound of discharges of guns, he did
see flash after flash, proclaiming that the police,
under the impression that important criminals
were beating them to it, wished to show
their warlike spirit by such a bombardment.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the flying missiles came anywhere near the
ascending plane that fact was not manifest to the
two occupants of the cockpit; their movements
must have been too speedy for such an attack to
be successful and almost immediately they had
risen beyond the danger line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was feeling vastly relieved, for it would
have been a bad beginning of their special mission
were they detained for days in the Southern
city, while the agents of the great counterfeit
league held the upper hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>He could see with the last glimpse he had of
the aviation field that all this lively accompaniment
to their take-off had created considerable
excitement—people were running back and
forth, like milling cattle when stampeded in a
furious thunder storm and Perk even fancied
there was some sort of a movement as though a
ship would be sent after them in pursuit.</p>

<p class='c013'>That troubled him not a bit, because already
they were leaving the field far in their wake, and
would really be lost in the gathering shadows of
coming night before any pursuit plane left the
ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides, had they not already had one experience
along those lines, and completely worsted
the persistent enemy, sending their boat down in
spirals of flames, with the two occupants forced
to “bail out” in order to save their lives?</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk put that possibility completely out of
his mind and busied himself with more practical
affairs. First of all he was desirous of communicating
with his comrade and to do this
they must have those indispensible head-phones
clapped to their ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was already applying his own pair with a
confidence inspired by frequent applications,
after which he managed to get Jack equipped
with the other pair.</p>

<p class='c013'>Steadily they continued to ascend, and swing
around until they faced the east, following the
plan Jack had outlined to his mate. Not too
high did the pilot urge his craft, since such a
course was apt to bring them in the sunlight
that still lingered along the upper air lanes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, they turned out to be a hot bunch all
right, partner,” was what Perk observed, when
he had the harness adjusted and the ear-phone
means of communication in shape for use.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You reckon they must have fetched the police
out with them, do you, Perk?” demanded the
one at the stick, as he kept an eye on his dials
spread across the black dashboard in front of the
cockpit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! just what they did, old hoss,” returned
the other, vehemently, but accompanying his remark
with a loud chuckle that told of secret
amusement, he being excessively fond of anything
that smacked of a joke; “an’ they kept up
a runnin’ fire at us, let me tell you—could see the
flashes spittin’ like fire crackers on the Fourth
o’ July.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All of which sounds like they must have told
a pretty wild and woolly yarn to the cops, to
make them want us as bad as that, eh, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Makes me think they got an idea this ain’t
goin’ to be just a ordinary man-hunt, but something
worth while; we should worry, Jack.
Mebbe they a’ready see the handwritin’ on the
wall, an’ mean to try an’ upset us in the start,
’fore we get agoin’ full tilt. Notice you’ve gone
an’ headed east, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It may fool them; but whether it does or not,
Perk, such a move’s our proper caper. When
we’ve gone something like ten or fifteen miles
we’ll get on the curve, swing around to the south,
and then when in sight of the gulf turn due west;
after that we’ll be on our way to the place where
our work is waiting for us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! had an idea you’d just climb till out
o’ sight, an’ then cross over the city and river—how
’bout it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too much risk to begin with,” came the ready
reply, showing how Jack always planned ahead;
“you know how a rushing boat can be heard
clearly even when lost to sight among the clouds.
It might be those same smart chaps, backed by
the authority of the police, would commandeer
a ship, and cruise around over the city, so as to
learn if we <i>did</i> come back so as to line out into
the heart of Texas; to make sure such a giveaway
of our plans can’t upset our calculations
we’ll cross the delta of the Mississippi close to
where it joins its muddy waters with the gulf.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you now, partner, an’ let me say I guess
that’s the safest game we c’n play. Time don’t
count anything wuth while with us on this trip
but results are what we crave.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it that time, boy, the Big Boss has
confidence in our being able to fetch home the
bacon, and we’re bound to prove he didn’t make
any mistake in putting us on the job.”</p>

<p class='c013'>All this time they continued to zoom along
like a frightened wild duck, and it was not long
before Jack was turning the nose of his ship
toward the south. The night had not as yet
settled down over the earth, although they were
holding an altitude of several thousand feet and
by straining his eyes a bit Perk was able to distinguish
objects far below—he could tell when
they passed over a large sheet of water, probably
Lake Ponchartrain, with narrower cuts winding
through vast marshes, and seas of waving reeds;
also begin to catch fugitive glimpses of the still
distant Mexican Gulf stretching away to the
mysterious south.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was all deeply interesting to Perk, always
on the lookout for fresh and novel scenes; for as
it happened, thus far in all his wanderings he
had really never looked upon that historical sheet
of salt water; although reading many a rattling
romance of the days when buccaneers and pirates
haunted the sub-tropical waters of that same
gulf, lying in wait for the Spanish galleons laden
with gold bars taken from the prodigally rich
mines of Mexico and Central America.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Perk’s mind those historical personages,
like Blackbeard, and his fellow rovers of the
Black Flag, lent a glamour to the great body of
water that was apt to thrill him through and
through whenever he allowed his gaze to fall
upon its restless surface, and dark secrets of the
past ages.</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards their course was again
altered, with the ship swinging into the west. It
would seem to have been something like extreme
caution on Jack’s part but from all accounts, as
well as from their own experience with the desperate
gang that had given Uncle Sam so much
trouble, the scoundrels had a tremendous game
at stage, and were ready to go to any lengths to
protect the profitable conspiracy from being
smashed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Safety before speed” had always been Jack’s
slogan, which could be accounted one of the leading
reasons for the success that had come to him
in the various vocations he had followed—as a
county fair barn-stormer, then in the regular air
mail service, and now finally with the celebrated
Secret Service arm of the Government, entrusted
with one of the most abnormal duties ever given
out to its members.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not too dark for Perk to know when they
were passing over the several outlets to the
mighty river; indeed, he was even able to distinguish
an ocean going steamship heading up
toward the city of New Orleans; for its lights
were plainly in evidence and those who chanced
to be on deck could probably catch the throb of
their motor, since the air was unusually still,
allowing sounds to be heard at great distances,
especially when in the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then finally they left the water behind, and
found themselves passing over great stretches of
sugarcane, and bamboo thickets, with cabins of
the humble blacks in little hamlets, sometimes
villages of the lowlands, where, as Perk plainly
recollected, recent terrible floods had wrought
such damage.</p>

<p class='c013'>So the night wore on, and thus far nothing
had occurred to cause them the slightest worry.
If their cunning enemies suspected them of
planning to go west, and baiting the chief in his
lair, there was nothing as yet to show that they
were making arrangements to intercept the air
adventurers on their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>An hour—two of them passed, and still they
kept making rapid progress. The moon was long
above the eastern horizon, although occasionally
obscured by passing clouds but Perk told himself
it was a pretty fair night, all things considered,
and that he had “no kick coming.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c014'>CHAPTER XV <br /> <br />PERK AS A FIRE-FIGHTER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was not far from midnight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had insisted on taking over the controls,
so that Jack might secure a little rest, possibly
even pick up a few catnaps in addition. They
were at a low altitude, perhaps not more than a
thousand feet up, since the air was a bit cool
higher and it was certain they stood in no
danger from colliding with mountain peaks
while crossing the wide State of Texas, where
nothing save the level plains lay beneath.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was alive to his duties, but this did not
keep him from occasionally stretching his neck,
so as to look over the coaming of the cockpit,
and trying to make out objects that might be
dimly detected on the seemingly limitless plain
below.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a rule next to nothing worth while rewarded
these efforts and really he continued
doing his little stunt from sheer habit, but there
did come a time when he showed sudden interest,
and even half arose from his seat to stare
with increasing intensity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not only that but he immediately banked, to
start circling around a certain point. A minute
afterwards Perk reached out and shook Jack
gently by the shoulder. The ear-phones being
still affixed to their heads, Jack naturally desired
to know what was up, and did his pal wish to
give over the stick to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ doing, partner,” he was told with
emphasis; “but there’s somethin’ queer goin’ on
down yonder, and I’ve swung around so’s to give
it the once over. On your right, Jack, an’ there,
see how it sparks up again, will you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say it looks like a fire,” ventured Jack,
after taking a good look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My idea to a fraction, boss!” snapped the
deeply interested Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like it might be breaking out through
the roof of some sort of cabin, or ranch house,”
further suggested Jack, himself now almost as
excited as his running mate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, boy!” declared Perk; “but somehow
I don’t lamp anybody kickin’ around in a
big fuss, ’cause o’ the shack bein’ ablaze; strikes
me either nobody ain’t to home or else they’re
so sound asleep they don’t know what’s goin’ on.
Glory be! if that’s the case, partner, they stand
a mighty good chance o’ bein’ burnt to death in
their beds. What ought we do ’bout it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“First place we’ve just got to rouse ’em up,
and the way to do that is to rush our engine to the
limit, so’s to make a big row—if that doesn’t
wake anybody it’ll only mean they’re away from
home—or else already smothered by the smoke.”
Perk accordingly started up such a racket that
the dreadful roaring noise seemed hoarse enough
to awaken the dead and all the while he kept
swinging around in a continuous circle.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack, bending over the side, watched to see if
this had any effect, nor was his discovery long
delayed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That fetched them, Perk—I can see several
moving figures, and they seem to be rushing about
with pails in their hands. If the fire hasn’t got
too strong a start they may be able to throw
enough water to put it out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jack, couldn’t we do somethin’ more to help
the poor dicks?” cried Perk, ever ready and
willing to assist anybody in trouble, no matter
at what cost or personal risk to himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It mightn’t be a safe thing to attempt a blind
landing,” he was told; but something in Jack’s
voice or manner when he said this encouraged
Perk to go a bit further.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, chances are it’s as level as a barn floor
down there,” he hastened to say, eagerly; “here,
you could take the stick—there never was a better
hand at makin’ a three-point landin’ than
you, partner; me, I might drop a few flares down,
an’ that’d give us a squint o’ the ground. If we
kept to leeward o’ the fire there wouldn’t be any
risk from sparks, don’t you see, Jack? I never
yet had such a fat chance to be a fire-fighter;
let’s go, boy—they need all the help they c’n
get, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The temptation was so great it soon overpowered
Jack’s sense of caution; really he fancied
he would never forgive himself if he allowed
Perk to show a higher sense of duty to people
in distress than he himself could display.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, you win, Perk!” he quickly called
out; “hand over the stick, and get those flares
ready to drop when I give the word.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk started to make a move, showing that he
knew just where the objects of his desire were
located, for he did not have to leave his seat in
order to place his hand upon the small package
of flares.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile Jack had reduced their speed to
a minimum compatible with safety, still continuing
that circular movement. The fire had
by this time assumed sufficient proportions to
dispel any doubts they may have entertained regarding
its true nature, for it was burning at a
lively rate. Jack could see a crouching figure
sprawled on the roof, and apparently emptying
bucket after bucket of water on the greedy flames,
and passing the empties back down the nearby
ladder to some one standing on an upper rung.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was all mighty exciting, and to Jack seemed
like some sort of fetching picture as shown on
the silver screen at the movies—a scene developed
through the skill of a wizard director, aided
by a group of star actors, so as to bring out all
the realistic effects.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get ready, Perk!” he told the other suddenly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All set, partner,” came the inspiring response.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let her go, then!” called out the pilot, just
as he found himself over a point to leeward of the
burning ranch house that he figured would be
the best place to make a landing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had a flare falling almost as the last
words left the lips of the pilot and then both
of them used their eyes to advantage as it neared
the ground, lighting up a small section fairly
well—at least what he thus saw seemed to convince
Jack it would be fairly safe to attempt a
landing, for the ground looked smooth, and free
from outbuildings, corrals, or wire fences.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Drop another, quick as you can!” directed
Jack; then, as this was carried out he started
down, showing the die was cast, come what
would.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk threw a third flare to one side, in the
hope that its light would afford his pilot a chance
to effect one of his really marvelous landings;
which turned out to be sound reasoning on his
part—the shock when their landing gear came in
contact with the ground was not very severe, and
Jack managed so that they did not run more than
thirty feet toward the burning house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus far all was well.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was out of the cockpit like a flash, but
managed to hold his eager spirit in check long
enough to allow his comrade to join him. Then
they hurried over to the building, which they
could now see, thanks to both the moonlight and
the brilliance of the blaze, must be some kind of
a ranch house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Several men who had the appearance of cow
punchers were working for all they were worth,
fetching water from a well, and hurling it where
it was calculated to do the most good.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s give you a hand in that game, neighbors!”
Jack burst out with, as he joined the string,
backed by Perk, and commenced handling
buckets full and buckets empty, with as much
vim as though tested and tried members of a
village fire company.</p>

<p class='c013'>At such a time the addition of two more
willing workers can do considerable toward
smothering a fire, especially when there happens
to be no wind moving; and from the moment of
their arrival things began to take on a better
look as though up to then the fight had been
hovering “on the fence,” as Perk called it, and
the balance being overturned, victory was in
sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was in his glory, and the brisk way in
which he hurried those buckets along was worth
going a long way to witness; Jack never would
forget how proud he felt over the marvelous performance
of his running mate, and how those
encouraging cries, so constantly emitted by Perk,
seemed to enthuse everybody with fresh vim and
go.</p>

<p class='c013'>Finally the last spark was extinguished, and
the house saved, having suffered but scant damage.
Then the men, yes, and women too, gathered
around the pair of aviators who had come
on the scene just in the nick of time, to first of
all arouse the people of the prairie ranch to a
sense of the danger that hovered over their heads,
and finally take chances in effecting what might
have been a rough landing, so as to lend their
material aid to the fire fighters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Surely you will not think of starting off again
till break of day,” the big man with the white
head of hair, evidently the rancher himself, was
saying, while engaged in pumping the hands of
the two who had dropped down from the sky,
as it were, to bring warning of the burning roof,
and start the stiff fight against the greedy flames
that had ended so successfully. “Stay and eat
breakfast with us, strangers; we’d like to know
you both some better, and have a chance to thank
you most heartily.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unfortunately we must be on our way, neighbor,”
Jack told him. “It happens we are on
special duty, and delay might upset certain plans
we are bent on following out. It was just by
sheer accident we discovered the fire, and took
the customary means for attracting attention that
all air pilots employ; but some other day, if we
chance to be in this neighborhood, we’d be
pleased to see more of you all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The women added their voices to the pressing
invitation, but Jack was forced to decline, although
doing so smilingly, since he would have
liked very much to see more of these warm-hearted
stockmen and their wild riders, possibly
picking up some useful knowledge concerning
the way a ranch is run in these modern days, so
different from early times in the cattle country.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is absolutely necessary for us to be going,”
Jack told them all, “if we are lucky enough to
be able to hop-off again. Perk, I wish you’d
take a look over toward the west, and see if the
ground is fairly clear; while I talk for a few
more minutes with our new friends here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was astute enough to avoid giving their
names to any one but the ranchman, who readily
promised not to mention them to a living soul;
he felt heavily indebted to Jack and his chum,
and considered that they knew their business
best—for one thing he felt absolutely certain the
fact of their being in such a hurry had nothing
whatever to do with any unlawful act on their
part—he had as much confidence in them as
though Jack had actually confided the fact of
their being Government Secret Service agents,
bound on a mission fraught with much peril to
life and limb, the prime object of which was to
save honest people from being victimized by a
gang of unprincipled sharks, makers of clever
bank notes that were without the pale of the
law and only base counterfeits, although clever
imitations of the genuine bills.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVI <br /> <br />IN THE GRIP OF THE STORM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Perk soon afterwards showed up, and seemed
so cheerful that it was evident his little scouting
mission had yielded favorable results.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems okay to me, partner!” he burst out
with, as soon as she came along; “course it ain’t
just as smooth as some fields we know but there
ain’t goin’ to be any smart trouble takin’ off, I
guess now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And are we holding the nose of the ship
straight in line of the course you took a squint
at, Perk?” Jack asked, as he prepared to climb
into his seat, the people of the ranch clustering
around, to gaze with wide open eyes at the fleet
aircraft, some of them doubtless seeing such a
modern cloud clipper for the first time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dead ahead, boss, an’ you’ll strike the right
racket, I’m tellin’ you,” came the positive assurance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then jump aboard, comrade, and we’ll put
it to the test,” saying which Jack himself climbed
into the waiting cockpit, to settle down in his
accustomed seat, take a quick glance at his dials
when the small light was turned on, and await
a signal from the other sky traveler that he was
“fixed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The way was clear, and the fact that just then
the gay old moon condescended to poke her smiling
face out from behind a mass of clouds assisted
more or less in giving the pilot some of the
necessary illumination—the rest must be left to
his native sagacity and instinct.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a bunch of cottonwoods at some
little distance ahead, the location of which Perk
had pointed out to his mate before settling down
in his seat but if all went well Jack calculated
to be able to clear them in good shape—did it
seem necessary he could swerve slightly to the
right, and have a clear field for the take-off.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a little shouting as the friendly
plane started to taxi along, but of course this was
smothered by the increasing roar of exhaust and
spinning propeller. Faster and faster they scurried
onward, and then started to rise on an angle
just sufficient to nicely clear the tops of the cottonwoods;
when Jack jazzed his motor, to find
it running as “sweet as a purring cat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So they departed only a short time after making
that landing which humanity had demanded
and in times to come the little episode was
likely to afford both aviators more or less satisfaction,
in that they had “seen their duty and
done it,” as Perk would say in his whimsical
way.</p>

<p class='c013'>As they continued on their way Perk found
himself wondering if this interesting adventure
was destined to be a sample of other equally
thrilling happenings in store for them the further
they dipped into the great game that had been
laid at their door by the powers that be at Washington.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whenever he came to thinking of the audacity
shown by Slippery Slim in virtually defying all
the authority of the Government, Perk would
feel his dander rising as if in great indignation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh!” he at one time told himself, being
rather fond of thus communing, as his thoughts
ran on, “we’ll call <i>his</i> bluff just the same, the
scaly ol’ gila monster, you wait an’ see. Thinks
he’s the whole works, the boss man-handler, does
he, just ’cause he’s outguessed a number o’ the
boys. This time he’s due to find himself up
against guys o’ the right size, who’ll jerk him
down off’n his high perch in a jiffy, or I miss
my ticket.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So Perk kept on boasting in his customary
fashion, possibly to keep his mind on the subject.
Jack was paying little attention to side issues
just then for he knew his pal’s peculiarities, and
short-comings as well and having “exhausted
his boiler” Perk presently lapsed into utter
silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had climbed to a fairly high ceiling, and
caught only occasional fugitive glimpses of the
earth far below, when the moon chanced to break
through the banks of clouds, which intervals
became less and less frequent, Jack noticed.</p>

<p class='c013'>He did not altogether fancy the looks of the
heavens, by degrees becoming more and more
overcast; still, this might after all mean next to
nothing and their business was to keep steadily
on their way as if things were bound to come out
all right.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was now drawing well on toward midnight,
and they had placed hundreds of miles between
the city of their recent stay and themselves. Long
since Perk had taken what proved to be his last
glimpse of the vast gulf as seen far away toward
the south, when the night was brightly illuminated,
with the moon’s silvery rays shining on the
glistening waters, and making a picture that
even appealed to Perk’s rugged nature—after
that all he was able to make out was the monotonous
level plains that lay in every quarter,
as though the whole earth consisted of this same
stock country.</p>

<p class='c013'>No longer were they able to find any cheer in
the company of the moon, for the canopy above,
earlier in the night peopled by a multitude of
bright stars, was now gripped in dense masses
of clouds.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having thus lost his guide marks below, Jack
was compelled to place all dependence upon his
faithful instruments, but this of course was an
old story to one of his experience, so that he did
not do any worrying on that score.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, buried in his own thoughts, and paying
scant heed to what changes were taking place
in the signs of the weather, had no warning until
suddenly there came a dazzling flash, that was
almost instantly succeeded by a tremendous burst
of thunder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ginger pop! that means we’re booked for a
bit o’ storm, mebbe, eh, Jack?” was his startled
exclamation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let’s hope it turns out to be <i>only</i> a bluster,”
the pilot went on to say, as he turned the nose of
his ship upward, and commenced to climb, evidently
in hopes that by so doing they might get
above those low hanging clouds, and have clear
sailing while the disturbance lasted.</p>

<p class='c013'>When shortly afterwards a second electrical
crash almost stunned them by its violence, Perk
began to fumble for his oilskin coat, which he
was never without when aboard a boat with an
open cockpit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk could take a ducking with as much good
nature as the next fellow but just the same he
did not intend to get soaked if he could help it,
since a continuance of the flight, with a cold wind
likely to follow the rain, would not prove to be
the most delightful experience possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>No sooner had he accomplished the job of
securing his raincoat than he gave Jack the well
known signal that he meant to take over the
stick, and thus allow his comrade to also protect
himself against bad weather.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly both of them were presently thus
equipped, and ready to take whatever might be
in the offing. Meanwhile the ascent was continued
in spasms, for there was always a chance
of getting above such a storm, and avoiding the
worst of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The thunder claps became more frequent, and
also much louder, so that each sudden burst gave
them both a thrill, death seemed so close, for
should their speeding ship chance to attract one
of those dazzling bolts it would be all over for
the daring air adventurers, and no one be the
wiser concerning their taking-off, until possibly
after long months had passed, their bleached
bones might be discovered by some party of
plainsmen out looking for rustlers or seeking to
round up missing stock.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus far not a single drop of rain had fallen,
according to Perk’s calculations but the coming
of the drenching flood could not be much longer
delayed, he felt positive. Had there not been
so much racket around them those keen ears of
his might have detected a rushing sound in the
near distance, like the roar of the incoming tide
on the sandy shores of the gulf.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then it came with a swoop, the wind whistling
around their ears and the rain beating a tattoo
against the fuselage of the ship, as well as striking
them smartly in the face, despite such protection
as their helmets and heavy goggles afforded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack certainly had his hands full in managing
the bobbing, shifting craft, gripped by those
shifty gusts that came with giant force, making
the flyers feel as though they were clinging to a
mere chip tossed about in the wild fury of a
Texas tempest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Time and again did Perk feel as though his
heart had jumped up in his throat, almost choking
him; seasoned veteran at this sort of thing
as he believed himself to be, he could not help
this feeling of helplessness in the hands of the
aroused elements; yet each time Jack managed
to bring their ship through the teeth of the storm
in a way that was next door to miraculous, and
if Perk had up to this time not fully appreciated
the astonishing skill and confidence of his younger
companion while at the controls in an emergency,
he certainly was getting his lesson then and
there, in a way to cause it to sink deep, and stick.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch17' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVII <br /> <br />A FIGHT WELL WON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was no longer possible for the busy pilot to
keep on his course. Every minute of his time
was taken up with a desperate effort to keep
from being thrown into a nose dive, that, unless
miraculously conquered, would be likely to
send them whirling down, to crash from a five
thousand foot ceiling, and thus bring about a
complete writeoff.</p>

<p class='c013'>That however was the least of Jack’s worries—all
he asked was the ability and luck to be
able to fend off threatening disaster; could this
be done successfully in good time they could
pick up all that was lost, and once more continue
their westward flight.</p>

<p class='c013'>The battering they endured was simply tremendous,
and Jack marveled at the ship being
able to withstand such a horrible strain. If
but a single strut gave way under all that pounding
it would mean starting a series of similar
mishaps such as would quickly render them incapable
of keeping aloft; and with this threat
hanging over their heads it can readily be understood
neither of the two could be in a comfortable
frame of mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still it is wonderful how men thus threatened
will continue to carry on, although in an almost
mechanical fashion, doing just the necessary
thing with each change of pace on the part of
the tricky storm, and meeting successfully every
near tragedy as it arises to clutch them in its
grip.</p>

<p class='c013'>No longer did Jack keep on climbing—it
seemed to him that the further the staggering
boat lifted the more dangerous became their
situation for the air was surcharged with electricity
as the zigzag lightning darted from cloud
to cloud, doubling the chances of their frail
craft being struck.</p>

<p class='c013'>In fact it seemed so terrible above that he
lacked the nerve to persist in the upward work,
and even commenced to drop down. Perk
noticing this move, hardly knew what to make
of it. He was, as he himself would have expressed
it, “hanging on by his teeth,” in order
to keep his seat in the wildly plunging airship
and on finding that the bold pilot had given up
hope of finding relief in the upper regions, the
fact appalled him. Could it be Jack had decided
to attempt a landing, with only the glare
of those repeated electrical flashes to serve as
airport lights? That indeed would be next to
admitting their case as hopeless, and that Jack
was taking such desperate chances only as a last
resort.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were zooming along all this time as if
pursued by a jinx and indeed with such weird
accompaniments it would not be hard to believe
the spirit of the storm took on the part of such a
goblin of the air, to pursue relentlessly this bold
invader of the home of the aroused elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk hit the bullseye close to the center when
afterwards, in describing their experience on
this night of the great blow, he vowed they were
“playing dice with death,” since it seemed a bare
chance that they could ever pull through alive.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such is the life of the aviator—one hour sailing
smoothly along, at peace with all mankind,
envying no man his following, and feeling himself
to be on the top of the world—the next and
he may be fighting with might and main the
mad demons of the air, his life hanging in the
balance, his strength ebbing fast, and unless the
little cherub aloft that is said to be watching
over each sailor, whether of the sea or the limitless
air, comes to the rescue, his fate is sealed,
and another modern Argonaut never comes back
again to the home port.</p>

<p class='c013'>It did not seem to be any the less exciting even
when they had succeeded in gaining a much
lower altitude; although possibly the danger
from those thunderbolts might have been somewhat
abated. Perk soon realized that his pilot
had no intention of trying for a landing in the
midst of such a turmoil and confusion, which
fact relieved his harried feelings to some extent.
Indeed, it would have been a mad proceeding,
and almost unheard of, since hardly the slightest
chance offered for the most skillful pilot to
reach the earth without disaster, such as making
a ground loop, and having the heavy engine bury
them under its weight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk endeavored to convince himself that
things were a bit easier since a lower altitude
had been effected but in so doing he feared he
was only deceiving himself—if anything at all
things were even worse,—although the drop
might not be so far, which was small comfort,
since it must mean their complete annihilation
if it befell them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had numerous spasms when he fancied
something was going amiss with their staunch
craft, although unable to decide the exact nature
of the imaginary trouble. Despite all these
chills, which must have been the products of his
excitement, they managed to hold out minute
after minute, which fact gave more or less cause
for renewed hope.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack must indeed be almost completely exhausted,
and yet he refused to give up the controls,
to which his hands seemed glued as though
riveted there. Perk punched his side numbers
of times, but could get no favorable response,
proving that the other deemed it too hazardous
a proceeding to change possession of the stick
while in the whirl of that shrieking gale—which
was indeed only another adaptation of the old
proverb “it is folly to change horses when crossing
a stream.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no means for communication with
each other, even though they may have wished
to do so, since the ear-phones had been discarded
with the donning of their slickers, and
could not be put back in position, owing to the
sudden bursting of the storm, and the necessity
for employing their hands in more useful pursuits.</p>

<p class='c013'>All Perk could do was to hang on, keeping
himself ready to seize hold should his companion
be suddenly compelled to release his grip
through sheer weariness—that, and keeping tabs
of the weather, so as to glean the first favorable
sign that came along, promising a let-up, or at
least a break.</p>

<p class='c013'>Judging from the heavy rain that had come
down in such a solid stream it must be reckoned
one of those dreadful cloud-bursts of which he,
Perk, had so often heard, but which thus far in
his experience he had never met up with. No
doubt rivers would be out of their beds long before
dawn although that angle of the situation
did not interest them in the least, since their
traveling would not be interfered with a particle,
if only the air proved inviting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yes, soon Perk believed he could detect a lessening
of the baffling crosswinds that had been
so trying to the pilot, keeping him continually
on the anxious seat—then, too, it struck him the
floods were growing weaker in the bargain;
which two facts gave poor Perk a feeling akin to
joy in the region of his heart, such as he may
have known on previous occasions, but that must
have been far down in his adventurous past.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to their altimeter they were something
like two thousand feet from the ground,
but of course never the faintest glimpse could
they secure of what lay beneath them, so poor
was the visibility, with all that torrent of water
pouring down as might a mountain cataract.</p>

<p class='c013'>This delightful feeling grew stronger as minutes
passed—at this rate he would soon be able
to influence tired Jack to renounce his frozen
hold on the stick, and turn the handling of the
ship over to his chum.</p>

<p class='c013'>In this frame of mind he again nudged the
other, but in turn received a negative shake of
the head, which meant there was “nothing doing”—in
other words, since the storm still raged,
even though in somewhat diminished violence,
they must not be too premature, and spoil it all
just when the victory seemed about to drop into
their hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>With what Perk hoped would prove to be a
last dying spurt the rain came pelting down,
after which it suddenly stopped as though an
unseen hand away up among the clouds, had
plugged the gap, and kept any more water from
running out—enough was enough, surely, Perk
was telling himself when he made this thrilling
discovery and for one he felt he had had sufficient
rain to last him the balance of that year.</p>

<p class='c013'>So too did the wind start to diminish its force,
also coming from one direction with more constancy—some
relief to Jack, that was certain,
since now he could know just how to steer his
turbulent craft so as to meet the force driving
against it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then what did Perk do but start getting his
ear-phones adjusted, being wild to hear a human
voice, after all that fiendish roaring and howling
kicked up by the raging elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>Why, already the atmosphere had cleared
enough for him to catch faint glimpses of what
lay beneath them—it looked as though they had
come to a stretch of country where the level
prairie had changed into rougher ground, with
deep swales, sometimes running into quite respectable
ravines and there were indications of
ridges ahead, which might even prove to be
fairly high, so that it would have been tempting
Providence had Jack dropped still lower, while
flying blind through all that welter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Talk to me ’bout luck,” the grateful Perk
was saying to himself, “I never ran ’cross anything
like <i>this</i>—they told me Jack must a been
born under a lucky star, an’ now I sure b’lieves
it to be the right stuff they were givin’ me, an’
no taffy either. But that was some fight, take
it from me, fellers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards Jack condescended to give
him the sign that he was willing to pass up the
job; whereat Perk quickly superseded him as
pilot, and saw the other sink back in his cramped
quarters as though unable to hold up his tired
arms a second longer. Apparently the relief
had come not a minute too soon, for he must have
been close to the point of utter exhaustion after
so long and violent a strain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Battered as the crate had been while the gale
lashed them so madly, it had stood up under the
buffeting most amazingly and Perk would
never have occasion to utter anything saving
words of praise for the model and its makers;
it must be as near perfection as aircraft are being
built these days of man’s victory over the
savage forces of the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Setting his course in what he believed to be the
proper direction Perk waited until Jack seemed
fairly well recovered, when he was pleased to
see the other take up his head harness as though
he too felt the necessity for opening up communications
with his running mate, which outlook
gratified Perk immensely.</p>

<p class='c013'>There were many things he wished to have
made clear, and besides, he felt more than curious
to learn what Jack’s next move might turn
out to be—that they had drifted far from their
original course went without saying but a means
must be found to recover the lost ground, after
which they could take up the game again just
where the sudden storm had caused such a diversion.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then the moon peeped out through a
break in the clouds overhead, as though to tell
them it was all over, with decent weather once
more in the offing.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch18' class='c014'>CHAPTER XVIII <br /> <br />THE DESERTED SHACK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Well, that’s somehow I guess over, and I’m
mighty glad,” was the way Perk voiced his feelings,
when the clouds were rolling away, and the
heavenly host of stars backed up the moon in
lighting up the firmament.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Same here,” echoed Jack, still more or less
tired after his energetic battle with the unleashed
elements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And strikes me the air’s got some chilly,”
added the other; “I own up I’m shivering to
beat the band right now. Where d’ye figger we
might be, partner—must a lost our course in all
that kettle o’ rain an’ wind, an’ drifted far to
the south, eh, what, old hoss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question about it, Perk; I could feel the
pull right along; still, there wasn’t a thing to do
but let the old crate take the reins in her teeth.
Once morning comes we’ll manage somehow to
get a line on our locality, and swing back to our
course.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some hours off yet,” ventured Perk, whose
lips were indeed trembling, as if the chill was
beginning to get in its work—perhaps all that
recent excitement was helping to make him
shiver, as it often will, even in the case of the
most valiant of men.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack noticed this fact, even though he himself
experienced nothing similar, for some reason or
other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See here, Perk, you ought to have a chance
to sit alongside a warm fire and dry off; the rain
must have got under your slicker, and I reckon
now you’re slopping around in water back there.
Something’s <i>got</i> to be done about it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! boss, don’t bother ’bout me; I’m a
hard-shell you must know, an’ a little dampness
ain’t agoin’ to do me any harm, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just the same we’ll try and make a landing,”
continued the other, “if there’s half a chance;
all I’d want would be to stack up against a level
stretch of upland, where the drainage had carried
off all that flood.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah, that sounds all to the good, boy but
what difference will it make, I want to know?
After such a storm it’s bound to be some cold
even away down here along the Texas-Arizona
line; they call them Northers, jest like I’ve heard
they do down in Florida. Forget it, partner—I’m
a tough guy, an’ ain’t wantin’ to be coddled
like a baby.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just the same I say we’re going to land, if
half a chance shows up,” affirmed the pilot, in
that set way of his. “We’ll find the stuff to build
some sort of fire, Perk, where you could make
a pot of hot coffee; which’d do you more good
than a switch of hard liquor. Put that in your
pipe and smoke it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk remained silent for almost two whole
minutes, during which time no doubt he was
revolving in his mind what Jack had proposed—in
imagination he could almost <i>smell</i> the delicious
aroma of the coffee, boiling so merrily
over the red coals and even feel a joyous sensation
of warmth stealing through his chilled body.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Okay, Jack; you win, hands down. Me for
the coffee every time, to be followed by a quiet
smoke o’ my fav’rite brand o’ tobac. Have your
own way about it, partner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then get ready to try and make out what
sort of ground we’ll soon be passing over,” added
Jack, as he turned the ship earthward, and slid
down on a long glide, with the motor clamped
shut. “We’ll skim along close enough for you
to get a good idea as to how matters stand, and
yet giving enough distance to keep clear of any
clump of trees, or little bald knobs of rises.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently Perk assured him he could manage
to get fair glimpses at what lay below; at which
Jack again started on an even keel, moving with
as little speed as was compatible with safety.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not very long before the watcher gave
tongue.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Looks good to me down yonder, partner—guess
now we might make a safe an’ sane landin’—’specially
with <i>you</i> at the stick. Circulate
a little bit to the south, brother, ’cause it looks
some better thataways.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This Jack did, and then at another signal from
the observer, he proceeded to drop down with
almost as much confidence as he might have felt
when making a landing on Candler Field, well
lighted, and with every convenience suited to
safety and comfort.</p>

<p class='c013'>His confidence, it seemed, had not been misplaced,
for they effected a very fair contact, all
things considered, even though the landing was
somewhat “joggly and rough” as Perk expressed
it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once the ship came to a stop and both of them
hastened to clamber out of their close quarters—“cribbed,
cabined and confined,” Jack sometimes
liked to say in connection with their limited
cockpit, although his pal always reminded him
of the fact that <i>cabin</i> was something only conspicuous
by its absence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk’s first movement was to start threshing
his arms against his thighs with more or less
vigor, in which he showed good common sense
since there is no better method for stirring up
sluggish circulation after a long period of inaction.
Jack on his part commenced to check
up on certain sections of the undergear, meaning
to make certain he had done no damage in making
connection with the earth under such unfavorable
conditions.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Everything in ship-shape, I reckon, Perk,”
he announced. “And now let’s make out to find
something in the line of trees, where we might
pick up enough wood for that fire.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Looks kinder like things’d be mighty well
soaked after all that downpour,” affirmed the
shrewd Yankee-Canadian; “so it’d be a tough
job coaxin’ stuff to take fire. But wait a minute,
partner—I didn’t get a chance to tell you that I
spied what looked like an ol’ tumbledown shack
over to windward—I guess now it might be
abandoned, but just the same, partner, we’d be
apt to run across some dry wood inside.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suppose you step over and take a look-in,
Perk,” suggested the other. “I’ll stand by the
crate here, and keep our little glim working, so
you’ll get your bearings when you start back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, Jack,” acceded the lanky one,
always eager for any sort of service; “an’ by the
same token now I’ll tote my gun along—never
c’n tell what sorter game you’ll stack up against
on these here Texas plains, I’m told. I feel like
I could knock over a wolf er two, just to get my
blood to movin’ at a faster clip—how ’bout it,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suit yourself, Perk,” he was told, as Jack
climbed back into the cockpit so as to manipulate
the light he mentioned, and which would prove
sufficient to serve the wanderer as a beacon when
wishing to retrace his steps.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly Perk wandered off, having decided
as to the quarter where he had glimpsed
what looked like an old and lonely shack or
cabin, faintly seen in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>He came back in a short time, bubbling over
with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s all right, Jack—just like I guessed, it
turned out to be an ownerless shack but the roof
looks like it might’ve shed the rain, an’ oh! boy!
heaps o’ dry wood inside, with a whoppin’ big
fireplace where you could slap on the biggest
log agoin’. Mebbe I ain’t glad you thought o’
this game. Come along, an’ we’ll fetch the stuff
for a warm snack—coffee, crackers, an’ bacon
in the bargain. Talk to me about luck, it’s comin’
to us in big chunks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! we’ve got to get used to that sort of
thing,” said Jack, in the most matter-of-fact tone
imaginable; “when you’re on such a wonderful
lay as this anything’s likely to happen, and all
kinds of surprises spring out at you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder,” was all Perk could say in reply;
but he lost no time in gathering together such
articles as aluminum coffeepot, skillet, cups, and
such other things as he knew would be needed to
complete their little midnight spread.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon it’s safe for us to leave our crate
off here,” remarked the cautious Jack, “but I’ll
fix things so no busybody can take-off while we’re
away,” which he did without any trouble; after
which they both set out to move along to the
deserted shack Perk had located, lying right
there, just as if a favoring Fate had designed it
for their especial benefit in an emergency, as
the grateful Perk told himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Arriving at the humble shack, that once may
have housed a happy family in days that were
gone, they made use of Jack’s electric torch in
order to gather some dry splinters of wood,
which, heaped above some paper on the open
hearth, soon blazed up, and afforded them an
opportunity to take a look around.</p>

<p class='c013'>Other fuel more lasting was hurriedly added
to the fire, and this done the two air adventurers
took stock of their surroundings. There was
nothing much to see, since the shack happened
to be entirely devoid of any kind of furniture,
even of the most primitive make; but the roof
had stood the ravages of time, and promised to
hold out for years still to come.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk held out his chilled hands to the blaze
but only for a few minutes; apparently the possibility
of brewing some “nectar” was an overpowering
temptation, for presently he started to
work.</p>

<p class='c013'>In short order he had the steam coming out
of the coffee pot spout, and a most delightful
odor permeated the interior of that ancient
shack. When the coffee was ready, Perk poured
some of the amber fluid in both aluminum cups,
and offered Jack one, together with a freshly
opened carton of tempting crackers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goes right to the spot,” the self-made <i>chef</i>
observed, rubbing a hand across his stomach, as
though experiencing the most blissful sensation
there; “best coffee I ever tasted, barrin’ none,
an’ say, I’ve tried it a good many places like
France and Germany, as well as in Turkey too.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Same here,” Jack assured him, as he drained
his first cup. “By the way, didn’t you say you’d
fetched some bacon along over here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jest what I did, partner, an’ now I’ve had
my fust swaller o’ coffee I’ll get a move on an’
soon have some o’ the same asizzlin’ in the pan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He started to carry out his words, with the
interested Jack watching his efforts to try and
make the frying pan set evenly on the fire, a feat
that requires considerable knowledge of camp
tactics in order to be successful. After one near
spill, with Perk only saving an upset by quick
work, Jack modestly broke in to give a bit of
advice, not forgetting, however, that old saying
about “too many cooks spoil the broth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Too hot to keep hold of the handle looks like,
partner; now if only we were outdoors we might
find stones enough to form some sort of foundation
on three sides of the fire, where you could
rest your pan. Hold on, here’s this old hearth
that was made of some kind of Mexican bricks—adobe
they call them and it looks to me like
some of ’em might be loose. Here, I’ll manage to
pry a few up for you, Perk, old man—just hold—your—horses
and——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack did not finish his sentence, and the cook,
glancing up to see what ailed him, found his
pal holding the first adobe in an uplifted hand,
while he was himself staring hard into the cavity
from which it had come, as if he saw something
wonderfully fascinating there!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch19' class='c014'>CHAPTER XIX <br /> <br />FORTUNE KNOCKS AT THE DOOR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“I swan! what’s the matter, partner—my
sakes; is it a <i>rattler</i> you uncovered, I wanter
know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk on his part was already sharing the excitement
of his pal, although apparently from
an entirely different reason. He had already
started to scramble to his knees, being doubtless
bent on taking some aggressive action, when he
saw Jack reach forward and deliberately pluck
some object from the hole under the displaced
adobe fire brick, and hold it up to view.</p>

<p class='c013'>As he saw its nature Perk’s jaw dropped, and
he was the picture of abject astonishment—but
it was far from being any poisonous reptile that
Jack was thus exhibiting with such a grand
flourish; just as though he might be some necromancer
or magician, and drawing all manner of
amazing things out of an apparently empty
stove-pipe hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gosh-a-mighty! that looks like real money!
I swan!” burst from Perk’s lips, as he continued
to stare.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just what it’s supposed to be, Pal Perk,”
said Jack, trying to keep his own voice from
displaying a genuine tremolo—“a neat wad of
it, waiting here for us to drop in and pick it up.
Seems like things might be set up, like tenpins
in the alley, for two lucky dogs to knock down
with a couple of rolled balls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If that don’t beat anything I ever did see,”
continued the astounded Perk, now grinning, as
though the pleasant nature of their find was
commencing to appeal to him. “Jest think o’ a
pair o’ air tramps ahappenin’ along, runnin’
across this here deserted shack, an’ findin’ a fortune
askin’ to be taken care of—don’t it beat the
Dutch what c’n happen—Arabian Night’s adventures
can’t hold a candle to the real thing in
these modern days. Some ol’ miser musta hid
that boodle under the bricks, so’s to keep the
Mex raiders comin’ up over the international
border from gettin’ their itchin’ fingers on it—how
’bout that, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Off color, I’m afraid, Perk,” Jack told him,
after taking a quick look at his wonderful find
in the hearth <i>cache</i>; “that miser story might go
with some but it doesn’t wash with me worth
a red cent. In the first place if this money had
been hidden here by a miser, he’d have taken it
away with him when he cut stick. Then again
it would surely have been partly in hard cash,
like gold eagles, and such stuff—all hoards of
misers, you remember, are made up like that,
Perk, and when you give this the once-over
you’ll also notice how it’s all in bills, mostly
fresh ones at that, as if they hadn’t seen much
circulation, as you might say.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk drew in a long breath, and continued to
stare hard at the object Jack was holding out in
front of him; it might be that something in the
other’s words and manner suggested certain possibilities
that seemed almost too staggering for
poor Perk to digest offhand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gee whittiker jewsharps! Jack—what’s this
you’re hintin’ at, ol’ pal—give it to me easy-like,
so I c’n swaller it—all in bills—mostly
fresh ones at that—not seen much handlin’
around—say, are you tryin’ to tell me they’re
every one five dollar bills,—Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I reckon that’s what they are, Perk, I’d say,
from taking a quick look at the same.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bad currency—counterfeits—bogus stuff, er—what?”
gasped the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look for yourself, and you’ll recognize them
as having been printed from the same plates as
the one we’re carrying with us as a sample of
Slippery Slim’s best work.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Je-ru-salem crickets! I’m knocked silly for
a fact,” whimpered Perk; and then, as if mustering
up his vanishing stamina he went on to add:
“but however could they’ve got right there under
that brick—conjurer’s black magic, looks
like to me, partner, it sure does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nonsense! that part of it is easy enough to
figure out,” asserted Jack, as usual very matter-of-fact;
“the only thing that seems to border on
the miraculous is our running across this packet
of all the people in the Far West—it looks to
me as if some sort of Destiny might be handling
the cards—that all we have to do is to keep moving
and everything’s bound to come our way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure does seem like a snap, and that’s a fact,”
agreed Perk, calming down a little as he began
to grow more accustomed to the great discovery
that had resulted from their deciding to drop
down, and have a sociable cup of hot coffee;
“but I’ll be danged if I c’n make head or tail
out o’ this happening—now, what under the sun
did anybody want to stick that wad o’ long green
under the same adobes, I’d like to know, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! there might be any number of answers
to that question, Perk; for instance didn’t we
learn that it was the habit of Slim, or one of his
busy bees, to jump across the border every little
while with a load of the flimsy, and dole the stuff
out to a number of agents he has working with
him in this section of the country, also all the
way over to Los Angeles and San Diego?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was the spiel they gave us, for a fact,
boss,” admitted Perk, wagging his head eagerly,
as though he felt certain clever Jack would be
able to figure things out, and hit on some sort of
explanation that would cover these mysterious
happenings.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, this, then, might be one of his hidden
<i>caches</i>—at certain times this unknown agent
hides some <i>real</i> money in such a hole as this, and
comes along another dark night it might be to
pick up the big wad that was left in exchange
for the small one he contributed. And that is
the way the game runs, so I was told.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“By gum! but what grand luck for us to come
in on this deal, Jack—pretty soft, I’d call it,
and neither of us had any hand in it either—just
hit on this little bank by sheer chance! Goin’
to crib the loot, are you, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack scratched his head as though certain
plans were flitting through it, and he must make
a choice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, we have to start somewhere, you understand,
Perk, and it looks like the finger of
Fate might be pointing right at this shack, and
telling us to get busy and pick up a strong clue
that, if followed up, would take us straight to
that hideout Slim’s got across in Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess I see what you mean now, brother,”
ventured Perk, his face lighting up with extreme
joy; for he felt they were already on the track,
and that from that hour there must be rapid
action continuously. “If so be that ’ere critter
that slams out these bills on greenhorns and
come-ons is gettin’ anxious to see what sorter
prize he’s drawn in the lottery, why, he might
jest come along any ol’ time now, since the
storm’s over an’ there’s nawthin’ to hold him up.
Got any idea he’s nigh due here, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shouldn’t be a bit surprised if he walked in
on us any time,” ventured Jack; and then, seeing
the puzzled look on his chum’s rugged face
he went on to add: “I didn’t mention the fact
but while we were making our way over from
the ship I felt certain I glimpsed several far-off
lights, as if they might be in windows of cabins
or houses of some sort. Then, too, I surely did
hear a big dog barking, and something like a
rooster crowing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I’ll be jiggered if you ain’t got sharper
ears than I c’n boast, Jack, ol’ hoss, which ain’t
no lie either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t you believe it, Perk; it just happened
that you were so wrapped up in thinking of that
coffee treat you didn’t pay as much attention to
outside things as I did. So it seems as if there
might be some kind of a village or prairie town
not more than two miles from this abandoned
old shack and if that’s so then the chances are
this agent who’s been working the public for
Slim probably lives there. Then again, like as
not he has a pretty good idea about when his
bunch of kale ought to be placed under that
brick—in fact he might have made his way out
here this very night only for the storm threatening.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just so, partner,” Perk hastened to say, brimful
of energy, “which, bein’ the case, it’s up to
us to lay a sweet little mantrap, so’s to trip him
by the heels if so be he knocks on our door.
How’ll we fetch it, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“First of all we’ll finish our supper, and clean
up here,” came the ready explanation; “he may
smell the odor of coffee and bacon, but then you
might expect this shelter to be used once in a
while by Mexican tramps, or passing cowboys,
especially when a big storm threatens, so that
isn’t going to scare the Johnny. As for us, we’ll
fix things so as to give him a nice little surprise,
by hiding out, after making things all dark inside
here, with water thrown on the fire to
smother the hot coals, after which there’s nothing
to do but take things easy until he shows up—if
he does.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I sabbe, okay, partner; let’s get busy, for
the bacon’s done brown to a turn.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch20' class='c014'>CHAPTER XX <br /> <br />SPRINGING THE TRAP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There was much that must be done before they
could feel satisfied they had their mantrap arranged.
Jack realized that if the party who
played the part of local agent for the counterfeiter
gang had been kept from coming to secure
the fresh supply of bogus bills by the threatening
storm, he was likely to make his appearance
at almost any time, since all danger from the
electrical disturbance was now past.</p>

<p class='c013'>They finished their little supper without
wasting any more time, after which the matter
of hiding all traces of their presence was taken
up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See if you can find any water outdoors,
Perk,” Jack was saying, as he contemplated the
red embers of their late fire. “Seems to me I
stepped in some sort of a puddle while coming
up to the door. Here’s an old rusty can that
looks as if it’d hold a quantity—I want to dash
it on these coals so as to cool them off. That
done we’ll find some way to hide, and watch developments.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk sized up the situation cleverly enough,
and lost no time in setting about doing as his pal
suggested. When he came back he was carrying
the rusty can, which did leak a trifle, but
then that made no particular difference, so long
as enough water remained to put the fire out.</p>

<p class='c013'>It sizzled, and steamed a bit but Perk distributed
the fluid contents of his can with such
discretion that all this was speedily brought to
a finish, with the last red ember cooled off, leaving
a dead little pile of wood ashes as the only
reminder of their blaze.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now that’s settled, partner,” said the always
ready Perk, “what comes next on our program?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had his hand electric torch in use, for
otherwise they must have been left to grope
around, since the clouds continued to drift past
in clusters, shutting out most of the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We must gather up everything here that
might give us away, for like as not the fellow’ll
fetch some kind of a light along with him—lantern
it may turn out to be, because he knows its
apt to be pretty dark inside the old shack, and
he can’t do much just by fumbling around.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! that’s right, boss,” returned Perk,
commencing to gather up any and all their
scanty belongings, not forgetting that convenient
rifle of his. “But I say, how ’bout the bus—won’t
he lamp the thing settin’ there in the open
an’ ain’t it apt to give him a bad start?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had duly considered that very point in
making up his plans, and was ready to meet the
situation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Taken it all in all, buddy, there’s small danger
of that happening,” he went on to tell Perk.
“First, remember, the ship lies on that side of
the shack away from the spot where I glimpsed
those lights and if he comes along in a direct
line from the town there isn’t one chance in three
of him noticing it. Even if he does I reckon
he’ll feel dead certain only his own messenger’d
be flying in this region—he may never have seen
another crate besides the one sent out by Slippery
Slim.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She sounds good to me, Jack an’ I’m willin’
to take a shy at the target, if so be you guess it’s
straight goods, all wool’n a yard wide. Let’s
go!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly both passed out of the deserted
shack that had proved such a fortunate harbor
for them after the late storm. Jack knew what
they must do in following up the little plan he
had framed, with a view of giving the suspect
the shock of his life and without any further
preliminaries he set about carrying out the few
details.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a chink or two in this further wall,”
he went on to say, in a low voice, next door to a
whisper, “that will furnish us means for keeping
tabs on what’s going on inside. We’ll settle down
there, and just wait. As luck has it that side of
the shack is away from the moon, which is all in
our favor, in fact everything seems to be arranged
just to suit our plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bully set-up, boss, couldn’t be better for a
fact,” agreed the hopeful Perk, who firmly believed
in the element of Luck, and was immensely
gratified to discover how that little god
was working over-time in their favor—according
to his way of thinking it was always “better
to be born lucky than rich.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about it?” whispered Jack, after they
had commenced to crouch down in the darkened
spot he had selected.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just great, that’s all,” Perk assured him,
“show me where one o’ them cracks c’n be located,
partner, an’ then I’ll be okay—all
fixed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack obliged by directing his chum’s hand to
an opening, through which it would be easy
enough to keep watch over any happening inside
the shack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Next we’ll creep over to this further corner,
and try to find out when he comes along,”
continued Jack. “From now on, Perk, keep
your tongue between your teeth—no talking, remember,
but if it does seem to be absolutely
necessary, put your lips close to my ear, and
whisper—get that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nuff sed, boss, I’m on,” came faintly from
the figure crouching at Jack’s side, after which
abject silence fell upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>A little later on Perk, now that his hearing
was strained so as to pick up any kind of sound,
however slight, caught the barking of a watchdog;
it seemed to be at a considerable distance
from the shack, and he judged there might be a
couple of miles lying between. This was not a
great amount of ground to cover, if only the inducement
were sufficiently urgent and that fat
packet of enticing bank bills, supposed to be
secreted under the adobes of the old hearth, must
represent an alluring prize, capable of drawing
a chap who was fond of “easy money” out of his
snug home at this unseasonable hour of the
night, and indulging in a little hike, for which
effort he would fancy himself well repaid.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some time passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>They lay there just back of the comer of the
dilapidated and abandoned shack, waiting, listening,
and frequently feeling a little thrill when
some soft sound came stealing to their ears.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Perk plainly heard what was surely a
low cough, such as might be caused by a sudden
tickling in the throat. Some one was undoubtedly
approaching the spot, and coming from the
west, where they understood the prairie hamlet,
or village, lay at the foot of a small ridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>He merely touched his companion’s right arm
to let Jack know something was in the wind.
The cough was repeated, so that Perk chuckled
softly to himself, as if more than ever convinced
that luck was bent on handing them out further
fat plums.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was already creeping back so as to reach
the spot where those convenient peepholes could
be found and of course Perk imitated his example.
Thus it came about they were in complete
readiness to make good use of their eyes
when a slight scratching sound came from
within, and a tiny flash announced that the newcomer
had struck a match.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk could see him there down on his knees,
and intent on applying his lighted match to the
wick of a lantern he had evidently fetched along
for this very purpose. If Perk could have analyzed
the feeling that possessed him just then he
must have compared it to the exultation of a cat
when about to make a jump upon a sparrow,
close up to which he had managed to hide, all
prepared for the finishing act of the ambush.</p>

<p class='c013'>No sooner had the man succeeded in lighting
his lantern than with eager hands he commenced
lifting the adobe under which Jack had again
artfully placed the bait in the shape of that
tempting packet of bogus notes.</p>

<p class='c013'>How eagerly he pounced on the contents of
his queer <i>cache</i>, all the avariciousness of a miser
handling his hoard was displayed and at the
same time he looked hurriedly from one side to
the other, as though his guilty soul, conscious of
having thus broken the law of his country, was
already seeing the long arm of Justice stretching
out menacingly toward him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack evidently had seen enough to satisfy him
the genuine criminal was in focus, and that there
could be no miscarriage of Justice in effecting
his capture with the goods upon him. He was
creeping toward the open door of the shack, evidently
bent on taking the slick partner of the
counterfeiter chief by surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk lost no time in crawling at his pal’s heels,
bent on having a hand in the closing scene of the
little drama—he wanted to see with his own
eyes just how such a slimy beast would take his
“bump” when he found the meshes of the net
closing around him.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon looking in at the open door.
The man still knelt there on the hard earthen
floor of the shack, and appeared to be nervously
fumbling the sheaf of bills, as though trying to
count them, and be assured that he had received
the full amount to which he was entitled—that
there had been no “holdout” attempted.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps one of them happened to make a
slight sound—either that, or else the man’s guilty
soul caused him to fancy he heard something
for he turned his head. It chanced that the
light of the lantern fell full upon his dark face,
and disclosed the distended eyes filled with terror,
as well as the expression so ghastly that
passed athwart his countenance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put ’em up!” commanded Jack, sharply, in
a voice that would brook no nonsense and as if
mechanically influenced to obey, the wretched
trapped distributor of bad notes raised both
hands, the packet falling to the floor as if his
nerveless fingers could no longer retain their
grip.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and Perk stepped blithely into the
lighted shack, the former with his ready automatic
covering the badly shaken rogue, Perk
trailing his rifle in a suggestive way, as if able
to back his boss up on the slightest provocation.</p>

<p class='c013'>First frisking the other, and removing a gun
from his back pocket, Jack made a motion with
his hand as he set Perk to work.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get the bracelets on him, partner, then we’ll
ask him a few leading questions before we make
up our minds what the next step’ll be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But—hold on, Mister,” whined the poor
devil, all aquiver as he groveled there on his
knees; “I ain’t done nawthin’—this hear ain’t
my stuff—I jest suspicioned Jud he must a had
somethin’ hid out this way, ’case he kep’ comin’
an’ agoin’, so I kim tuh see what it mout be. Now
I knows he must a robbed thet bank over in
Tucson when he went off with a gang he runs
with.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stow that gab,” said the disgusted Perk,
“that’s all too flimsy to wash. We got you to
rights an’ where the hair’s short, an’ you’ll have
a chanct to see what the inside o’ the pen at Atlanta’s
like. This here’s counterfeit long-green,
an’ you knows it, mister,” with which cutting
remark he snapped a pair of steel handcuffs
upon the other’s wrists with the skill only one
accustomed to handling such “safety-first” contraptions
could display, proving that for one of
Slippery Slim’s active lieutenants the show was
indeed over.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch21' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXI <br /> <br />PICKING UP CLUES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>By this time the man whom Uncle Sam’s two
clever sky detectives had trapped, showed signs
of being almost in a state of collapse. Too late
did he realize what a terrible mistake he had
made when yielding to the blandishments of
Slippery Slim Garrabrant, and acting under the
belief that he could defy the law and get away
with it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the big idea, partner,” Perk was asking
after he and Jack had fixed things so there
was no possible chance for their prisoner to
break away, and give them the laugh. “Do we
jump off right now, or wait till mornin’, I’d like
to know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No hurry at all,” was the calm reply, “I
want to go over our crate once more before we
start that hop across to the California border,
I’ve good reason to believe things are okay but
a second overhauling will satisfy me better.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I kinder guess you won’t want me to slip
over to this here town, an’ pick up a few fresh
eggs, eh, boss?” and Perk’s voice actually took
on a wheedling vein as he made this remark
for if there was anything he dearly loved along
the line of “eats” it was those same “fresh eggs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack shook his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hardly think it would be wise,” he observed;
“we don’t know the lay of the land for one thing—it
might be this party has some backing among
his neighbors, and we’d find ourselves in a hornets’
nest before we knew what was what. No,
we can stick it out here the balance of the night,
which is pretty well gone right now, and be off
about sunrise.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There’s a lot more stuff around in here that’d
burn right well,” insinuated Perk; “how ’bout
another bit o’ fire—this night air feels some cool
to me an’ ’sides, we’d have a blaze ready so’s to
boil more coffee ’fore we kick off, eh, what,
partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Please yourself so far as that goes, Perk, I
reckon it wouldn’t feel at all bad to have some
fire, as we must hang out here several hours.
But don’t make any noise if you can help it.
Besides, we ought to keep an eye out for trouble,
no telling what this slick chap might work off
on us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! we’ll one o’ us keep watch off’n on,”
promised Perk, starting without any further delay
to gather some fuel, and get a blaze going.</p>

<p class='c013'>While he was thus engaged Jack took their
prisoner in hand, and commenced to grill him.
There was nothing of the dreaded “third degree”
rough-house measures in what Jack attempted
but he tried to show the man where his best interests
lay.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re in a bad fix, my friend,” Jack told
him: “and unless you come clean, so as to help
us round up the balance of your outfit, you’ll
be certain to get the full penalty the law lays
down. We know a whole lot about Slippery
Slim and his ways, and are dead certain we’re
bound to end up his graft before many more
days pass by. So when you’re answering my
questions don’t try to lie to me, for like as not
I’ll be already acquainted with the facts and
know you’re trying to beat around the bush.
Dangerous business, let me tell you; far better
for you to hold your tongue than deceive me.
Come clean, and I promise you I’ll do everything
in my power to have you let off easy, besides no
one need know you’ve turned State’s evidence.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he started in to put pointed questions,
concerning certain points that were vital to his
plans. Once he caught the man squirming under
the lash, and giving an answer that he very well
knew was like “beating around the bush.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know better than that, my friend,” he
told him sharply, “that’s only half a truth you’ve
given me. Don’t try it again if you know what’s
good for your health, or it’ll be a matter of possibly
ten years before you see your family again.
Stick to the truth, and it may be only a question
of six months you’ll spend at Atlanta behind the
bars. Now tell me again what I wanted to know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He had managed to impress his strong personality
upon the writhing wretch, who was
ready to throw himself unreservedly upon his
mercy and so the answers were given without
hesitation, although in some instances the man
declared he did not know, as he had only once
been across the line and visited Slippery Slim
in his hideout among the Mexican mountains.</p>

<p class='c013'>When Jack realized that he had really pumped
the other dry, he felt he had profited in many
ways and that their sudden determination to
make, a night landing, so as to recover after their
buffeting by the storm, had been a most fortunate
happening indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>For one thing he had learned that the name
of their frightened prisoner was Simeon Hawkins,
and that he had a wife and several children
living in the little prairie town only a few miles
distant—a fact that seemed to give him great
distress, now he found his avaricious dreams
wrecked, and himself in the hands of a couple
of those very same Secret Service detectives
whom the “big boss” had undoubtedly referred
to so contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk had been “listening in,” and chuckling
happily whenever he realized his mate had made
some sort of a “ten-strike,” picking up valuable
information that was destined to ultimately
serve their ends wonderfully, and help to “pot
their game.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They sat there for some time, talking in low
tones. The man who lay close by helpless was
silent as a rule, although several times he uttered
a dismal groan, when his feelings overpowered
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Guess I’ll step out, partner,” remarked Perk
at one time, “an’ slip over to the ship, I’d sure
hate to have some critter do us a bad turn by
meddlin’ with any o’ them dials an’ gadgets.
What I wouldn’t do to <i>him</i> would be a caution,
that’s right.”</p>

<p class='c013'>From the fact that Perk carried his rifle along
with him his meaning was not difficult to understand
and Jack felt sorry for the chap who was
at the other end of the gun sights when his pal
pulled the trigger.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk cautiously approached the grounded
ship, and started when discovering some moving
object just in its shadow. The moon was shining
brightly now, so that it was an easy matter to see
for quite some little distance, although so deceptive
was the light that even sharp-eyed Perk
could hardly have told whether some dark object
seen fifty feet off was a stump or a black dog
sitting there and watching him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Waiting until the object moved again, he discovered
he had been wise to hold his fire, for by
then he had made it out to be some species of
animal. He took several forward steps, whereupon
the beast started to move off, uttering a
little nasty snarl while doing so.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks, on’y a stinkin’ kiote after all, skulkin’
’round to see if he c’n stir up a little grub o’ any
kind. Get out, you varmint!” and he waved his
gun above his head while starting to run forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>This completely demoralized the cowardly
prairie marauder, so that he took to his heels,
and quickly vanished in the near distance. Perk
found everything all right when he gave the
stranded plane “the once over”; and being satisfied
that there was nothing to be feared from a
coyote prowling around in search of a supper or
breakfast, he returned to the shack to report all
well.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was busily engaged making certain notes,
and reading others connected with their present
business, as jotted down in his memorandum
book in a peculiar brand of short-hand all his
own, but which would appear as so much Greek
or Choctaw to any one else.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Better turn in, and get a few winks of sleep,
brother,” he told Perk, who had yawned once or
twice as he sat before the fire. “I’ll wake you up
in about an hour or so when you can take your
turn playing sentinel, until the dawn shows up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just as you say, old hoss,” came the ready
reply; “fact is, I’m a bit drowsy, an’ could get
away with a few winks; but don’t forget to wake
me when the hour’s up, remember.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s all right, partner,” Jack told him,
laughingly; “we’re in this game thirty-thirty,
and you’ll have your turn, depend on it. Now
get busy, and don’t you dare snore above a whisper
either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I do jest gimme a poke, Jack—tryin’ to
break myself o’ that nasty habit but I got to
have help, you know—no feller ain’t wholly responsible
fur what he does when he’s asleep.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In due time Jack aroused the other, and himself
sought a brief period of forgetfulness in
sleep. So the balance of the night passed, and
morning came with a clear sky, and a promise of
decent weather for the continuance of their
flight.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch22' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXII <br /> <br />OVER ARIZONA DESERTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Perk must have dreamed about that hot coffee
treat he had been promising himself, for when
Jack opened his eyes he found his comrade already
watching the bubbling pot, from which
delightful odors were commencing to escape in
the way of steam.</p>

<p class='c013'>They enjoyed quite a decent little breakfast,
what with the ambrosia contained in their aluminum
cups together with some crackers and jam,
after the crisp bacon had been disposed of. Jack
offered some to their prisoner, but the man sadly
shook his head, as if to say he had no appetite
whatever.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was not a bad looking fellow, only with a
weak sort of chin, and evidently built along a
line that could be easily tempted to go wrong if
the inducement were only gilded enough. Jack
felt sorry for him, especially since he had learned
about his family; and was determined to do what
he could so as to get Simeon off, should his information
prove of any value to their cause.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once breakfast was disposed of they all went
over to where the ship lay. By this time Simeon
had found that they really planned to carry him
off with them, a startling fact that added to his
alarm, for apparently he had never been up in
a plane, and a species of stage-fright made him
shake as if he had the ague.</p>

<p class='c013'>But there was no other way to work things,
for should they set him free the chances were
the man, forgetting his promise, would try to
send out some kind of warning to Slippery Slim,
and in the end he and Perk were apt to pay dearly
for their slip-up, perhaps even with their own
lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>When playing such a desperate game with so
canny a lawbreaker it would be the height of
folly to let the dictates of tender hearts turn
them from the path of “safety first,” and Simeon
must continue to “take his medicine,” even
though the innocent ones at home suffered for
his misdeeds—he had never considered others
whom his evil actions had doubtless harmed,
when they found themselves arrested for passing
worthless bills, and how could he expect these
sworn officers of the law to go easy with him
when caught in the act?</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk now began to wonder just how they
would be able to “tote” a third party in the limited
accommodations afforded by the double
cockpit of their ship. It was bound to prove a
tight squeeze, and not so comfortable but then
why grumble on account of a trifle like that,
when Fortune was giving them such a glad hand
all the while?</p>

<p class='c013'>He began to shift things around some while
Jack was busy checking the motor, struts, undergear,
and propeller, with the design of condensing,
and making more room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Funny how you c’n jam things into such a
small compass when you really an’ truly try,”
he told Jack, when he had finished his task. “I
kinder guess I’ll be able to fix him okay, ’cause
he’s no great shakes at size, an’, seems like to
me, he’s shrinkin’ right afore my eyes, he’s that
shaky. Then it’s only for the day, I figger; how
’bout that, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve planned all that out, partner,” he was
told. “As soon as we get over to the California
border we’ll give him in charge of some sheriff
to keep in the hoosgow till we’ve made our killing,
and are ready to deliver the whole batch to
Uncle Sam’s nearest U. S. District Attorney,
at Los Angeles or San Diego. That clear to you,
Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d say it was, boss, an’ here’s hopin’ we’ll
get there with both feet when the end shows up,
our prisoners hobbled, an’ with nice new steel
bracelets decoratin’ their wrists. Now to get
the gent aboard the boat, an’ stowed away.
Shucks! he acts like he might be scared out o’ a
year’s growth—some sillies get that way ’bout
goin’ up in a skyscraper the fust time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>His scorn for such a weakling showed in his
face as he helped Simeon to clamber into the
cockpit. The man was as white as a sheet, and
trembling as if expecting to meet with some dire
end in short order, once he left the firm ground
and took to the boundless air. His groans were
heartrending, and Jack felt sorry for the wretch
but for once Perk displayed no signs of sympathy,
it was all so silly in his opinion.</p>

<p class='c013'>He proceeded to take precautions by fastening
the greenhorn in by means of a stout strap which
would prevent his falling out should conditions
necessitate a sudden banking on the part of the
pilot, or a fierce gust of wind cause the ship to
give a unannounced plunge.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All ready, Jack,” announced Perk, after
completing these arrangements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll be with you inside of three minutes,” he
was told, and as the ground ahead had been examined,
and found to be fairly good for the
wheels to trundle over, there seemed to be nothing
more that could be done, only put things to
the test.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was “some rough,” as Perk told himself,
when violently shaken once or twice but they
managed to get up sufficient speed to admit of
Jack lifting her when the right time arrived.
Then they were off, rising like a bird, and almost
immediately opening up the village that nestled
there two miles off, at the foot of the low ridge.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack headed straight into the west, for that
was their route “as the crow flew.” He cared
not at all that they would pass directly over the
settlement, for few of the people were apt to be
abroad at such an early hour, nor would they
be any the wiser for seeing a plane pass overhead
at such a low altitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, looking down, found himself wondering
which of the modest cottages in line of his vision
chanced to be the home Simeon had spoken of
with such a catch in his voice. The man had
temporarily forgotten about his fears concerning
his own safety, while being carried so high above
the surface of the earth—he was stretching his
neck, and eagerly focussing his staring eyes on
one spot, which evidently held all that he held
dear. Perk ignored his recent sensation of scorn,
and actually felt sorry for the man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor guy,” he was saying under his breath,
though the other could not have heard him had
he shouted at the top of his lungs, on account of
the racket being kicked up by combined motor
and propeller, “he feels right bad ’cause he’s
goin’ off without a chanct to say goodbye. Well,
I on’y hope this will be a lesson to Simeon, an’
he’ll quit playin’ with a buzz-saw, which is the
long arm o’ our Uncle Samuel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon tried his best to keep tabs of the lonely
little hamlet until it was no longer possible to
distinguish objects, owing to the several miles
of distance the speeding plane had covered; then
he fell back in his seat, and let his head drop
on his chest, while his body shook with emotion.
In that dreadful moment he would undoubtedly
have only too gladly given all he had in the wide
world for a chance to undo the wrongs he had
committed in his haste to get rich.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! he orter thought o’ that before, while
the goin’ was good!” was Perk’s comment, who
had seen just such short-sighted men more than
once before in his eventful life, and had a philosophical
mind concerning all such late repentances.
“But I’m sure sorry for them that are
agoin’ to suffer the most—he deserves all he’ll
get, but they’re the innocent ducks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The plane soared along its set course, and as
they were not at more than something like five
thousand feet altitude, Perk could see very well,
when he adjusted the binoculars they carried of
necessity, so as to be able to spy out conditions
before trusting themselves to land, being naturally
a bit suspicious while thus drawing steadily
nearer to what might well be called enemy land.</p>

<p class='c013'>From time to time he found himself gazing
down with considerable curiosity upon scenes
which were mostly foreign to his eyes—he had
only too often scrutinized pictures where uncounted
troops belonging to the enemy were encamped,
or on the march, with monster guns
making the very air quiver with the tumult of
their discharges; where rival pilots came up in
answer to his insulting challenge, to engage him
in deadly combat—he had seen many an unlucky
or less skillful airman go down with his whirling,
blazing coffin, yielding up his life as a tribute
to what he called patriotism—all these and a
multitude of similar thrilling spectacles could
be unrolled in memory as he thus sailed the
azure sky, and saw Jack meet and conquer successive
air pockets lying in wait to give him battle;
and yet this was actually the first time Perk
had ever focussed his gaze upon a genuine cattle
ranch, and saw stock being driven to market,
or it might be mavericks branded; so that he
found himself entranced with the panorama
spread before him as they glided over the prairies
of New Mexico.</p>

<p class='c013'>There cropped up other and like interesting
sights when the wilder sector of country was
reached, with its deep gullies, its bare-topped
mountain peaks—perhaps stretches of desolate
desert where nothing could be seen save billowy
sandy wastes, except possibly patches of yucca,
sage, greasewood, and prickly pear cactus.</p>

<p class='c013'>When, his interest increasing, Perk begged
his comrade to drop down so as to give him a
nearer view of these strange sights, he was able
to increase his knowledge concerning the myriad
of strange sights to be picked up when touring
by air in new territories—now he could make
out the fantastic Joshua trees that seemed to be
engaged in a shimmering dance in the blazing
sunlight; moving shadows that sometimes crossed
the line of his vision he made out to be buzzards
on the wing, circling in search of their carrion
meal; while others on the ground he recognized
as coyotes skulking along, frightened by the sight
and noise coming from far over their heads, and
trying to reach their secret dens in some rocky
canyon or defile.</p>

<p class='c013'>Noon came in due time, with the ship keeping
up its steady grind, and having left hundreds of
miles in its wake.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk began to realize that he had eaten his
breakfast at an unearthly hour, and concluding
that a bite of something, together with a swig of
water from their jug, might go well, he mentioned
the interesting fact that the usual lunch
hour had come, at which Jack nodded his head,
as if to leave all that sort of thing to the discretion
of his trusted pard.</p>

<p class='c013'>So they had a pick-up snack, which was quite
acceptable to the two airmen, able to enjoy their
meals even while cutting capers up among the
clouds. It was another thing to the novice
Simeon, whose appetite had not come back,
though he did manage to swallow a few bites,
and have a drink of cold water to wash things
down. By slow degrees he was getting the upper
hand of his dreadful fears, for while familiarity
could not be said to bring contempt, nevertheless
he was becoming accustomed to the conditions,
and could even display a trace of curiosity
when looking down on some unusually interesting
spectacle to which Perk was pointing so
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>If things continued to exist as they had been
doing all morning it was likely—Jack at one time
told his co-pilot in answer to a question—that
they would be close to the California border by
sunset, or shortly afterwards; since even then
they were well along across Arizona, with fair
skies still beckoning them on their way.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch23' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIII <br /> <br />ON TO THE COLORADO</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Listen, Perk, I’ve got something you should
know—something that hinges on a change of
plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was saying this at a time when, relieved
from the controls he could enter into one of the
little confabs that their use of the ear-phones
allowed. All Perk had to do was to lean forward
and while still handling the stick drink
in whatever his co-pilot chose to say.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! spit it out then, partner,” was his familiar
way of inviting confidence and which
meant so much with those who knew Perk’s peculiar
sayings best.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be sure Simeon Hawkins was sitting close
beside Perk, and what Jack meant to confide in
his running mate could never be intended for
his ears but despite this elbow to elbow touch
there was not the slightest risk of his being able
to pick up a single word, owing to the clamor
kicked up by motor exhaust and propeller.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re going on a bit further than was arranged,”
said Jack, concisely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! meanin’ we don’t pull up when we
strike the border, eh, what, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just that, brother—the going is good, and
we might as well keep moving till we drop down
on the Metropolitan Airport grounds.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whoopee! you mean at Los Angeles, don’t
you, old hoss?” demanded Perk, apparently considerably
surprised by his pal’s bald statement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Righto, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How come, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get this fixed in your noodle,” said the resting
chief pilot—“circumstances often alter cases,
they tell us; well, when we figured on halting at
or near the border, close to the Gila River,
things hadn’t happened such as have hit us since
then.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Meanin’ the storm, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That was one thing,” admitted the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Knockin’ us out o’ our reckonin’, like, an’
makin’ us take a forced landin’ on the open
prairie where we run across that flimsy ol’ shack—does
that cover what you mean, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“After a fashion it does,” the other told him,
adding: “like the play of Hamlet, with Hamlet
left out, it falls flat. You omitted the chief reason
for my making this change in plans.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I guess you must mean Simeon here, eh
boy?” asked Perk, as if suddenly waking up to
the fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure thing—what are we going to do with
<i>him</i>, tell me, Perk? It’d be impossible for us
to lug him everywhere we mean to go, flying
across into Mexico, and baiting the wolf in his
own lair, as you might say. He’d be a constant
hindrance to our being free to act besides, we’d
run a fat chance of having him give us away,
just when we thought it was all over but the
shouting.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you, Jack—it means you don’t trust his
promises to lend us a helpin’ hand, and goin’
back on his pals—ain’t that the idea?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it,” replied Jack, never bothering
to drop his voice a particle, knowing as he did
that without the aid of those valuable ear-phones
Simeon, humped up against the side of Perk,
could not have caught what was said even
though it had been shouted at the top of his
voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what then, partner?” continued Perk,
apparently still groping in the dark.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing to hinder our tripping right along
till we fetch up at Angeles, when we can find a
way to hand him over to the Federal agents located
there. He’s connected with the big gang
against which Uncle Sam’s declared war to the
knife; and as a material witness, ready to turn
State’s evidence, they’ll be only too well pleased
to hold him <i>incommunicado</i>, so he can’t do a
thing to warn the bunch the big push is on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Okay, Jack. Sounds mighty good to me,
you bet. I’d never a cudgeled my brains enough
to hatch up an idea like that; takes you to think
o’ clever dodges, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then we’ll consider it settled, eh, Perk?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just what we will,” came the confident reply.
“’Bout when ought we raise the last beacon
on the road to Angeles, an’ lamp the field
lights at that same Metropolitan Airport?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! if everything goes well, you might call
it along toward midnight,” Jack assured him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got aplenty o’ gas to carry on that far, I’d
guess?” hazarded Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s to be hoped so,” said Jack; “because
there’s some mighty tough stretches of country
between the Colorado and the big Pacific city.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! so I understand, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And it would be a bad job for us if we had
to hit the ground where you couldn’t scrape up
a decent landing place with a fine-tooth comb.
When I take the stick again, Perk, maybe you’d
better have a look in, so’s to get tabs on our fuel
tank, and tell me how it stands. From the dial
finger yonder I figure we’ll have a lot more than
enough to see us through.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s right, boss,” affirmed Perk, after casting
a hasty glance at the tell-tale figures so
plainly marked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That settles it then,” with which remark
Jack showed by his actions that further conversation
was needless.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Simeon sat there through it all, never
once dreaming how his fate was being so calmly
settled; doubtless he imagined the consultation
had been about something connected with the
running of the cloud-chaser, and covered facts
such as would have been all Greek to him, even
had he been able to listen in.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was not at all bothered by this change
of plans on the part of the head pilot—it mattered
little when they managed to drop down at
the airport—chances were the ground lights
were kept on full through the whole of each
night, since air mail planes would be apt to
come and go, some of them having been thrown
out of their regular schedules by dense mountain
fogs, or head winds that cut down the customary
speed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, also, was well acquainted with the
courtesy to be encountered at all such well conducted
flying fields, where every one would be
eager to do whatever was possible for the comfort
of those who chose to visit such ports, and
show little or no undo curiosity connected with
the reason for their coming.</p>

<p class='c013'>True, they might turn out to be a bit short
with the “eats;” but Perk, who knew the ways
of his pal so well, felt certain Jack would see to
it they had a chance to “fill up” as soon as they
could strike an open restaurant, of which there
should be no lack in such a wide-open city as
Los Angeles, with its sporty crowds at Hollywood.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was moving on apace, and
there cropped up fresh thrilling sights every little
while, for Perk to stare at through his useful
glasses. They were following the course of
the famous Gila River toward its confluence
with the still better known Colorado, which
hundreds of miles further north passed through
the Grand Canyon country, most majestic in a
panorama sense of any region on the face of the
globe.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along about nightfall they might expect to
pass over Yuma, located close to the junction of
the two rivers. Perk wondered once or twice
why his pal had not decided to land there, and
turn the prisoner over to some one in authority;
but he felt certain Jack had good reasons for
not attempting this.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mebbe, now,” Perk told himself, with Jack
again running the ship, while he attended to
some of his own manifold duties; “he
guessed there might be a bad crowd at Yuma—fellers
apt to be in cahoots with the same
gang o’ daredevils Simeon here was connected
with; and who might even try to effect his escape,
so as to shut his trap—even go so far as to
knife the poor skunk to make sure he didn’t
peach. Oh! yeah, that’s the way Jack looked
at it, bet your boots it must be.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Soon afterwards the sun gave notice that it
was about to withdraw behind the line of mountains
lying toward the west. Jack had his bearings,
and expected to be able to pick up the flash
beacons arranged for the convenience of the air
mail corps in their night flights to and from Los
Angeles. So thoroughly has this all been
mapped out, with the signals to be found about
every ten miles, that a pilot can see as many as
three ahead at one time, depending on the altitude
at which he may be flying.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such wise precautions had been taken that
would make night flying just as safe and easy as
during the daytime one thing only cropping up
from time to time to raise trouble, and cause delay
was the presence of the fogs that were apt
to rise from the deep canyons, to blot out those
friendly gleams of flashing light marking the
air mail course from start to finish.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch24' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIV <br /> <br />SIMEON GROWS DESPERATE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It was commencing to grow dusk when they
sighted the lights of Yuma, that town on the railroad
leading to Los Angeles. Such a thing as a
plane flying overhead was so common these modern
days as to hardly excite any comment—they
came and went, with seldom anything out of the
usual taking place although not so very far
away, among the mountains, one of the most
dreadful of all air tragedies known to the annals
of flying had taken place, when the great
liner <i>City of San Francisco</i>, lost in a storm,
struck head-on against a rocky cliff, shattering
the ship and causing the death of every one of
those aboard, some seven souls in all.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now they had left Yuma far in their rear, and
Jack was watching to pick up the first flash beacon
on the way to the Coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>The weather continued to favor them, the
heavens being almost devoid of any semblance of
clouds, and the air quite cool at the height they
maintained while heading into the beckoning
west.</p>

<p class='c013'>Over deserts and mountainous stretches they
kept swinging along, to the constant accompaniment
of the customary chorus of a bustling plane
threading the mighty air lanes of the skies. The
silvery stars came out in battalions to sprinkle
the azure heavens like innumerable bright lanterns,
such as could be seen in Old Japan during
carnival times.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was the life, Perk told himself again and
again, sitting there after he had munched his
scanty portion of their meagre supper, Simeon
having again declined to share with them—what
air pilot who has tasted of the joys of such hours
could ever dream of forsaking his vocation, so
long as Fortune allowed him to retain his vision,
hearing, and the faculty for guiding an onrushing
ship through the realms of unlimited space—not
he for one, Perk assured himself, drawing in
huge draughts of the clear air, and watching the
wonderful beacons as they passed them by,
threading the pathway of the stars as it were,
straight toward their distant goal.</p>

<p class='c013'>The night wore on, with the voyagers making
splendid progress.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had made no miscalculation when saying
he believed they would fetch up at their destination
somewhere about the midnight hour; for
it still lacked more or less of that time when in
the near distance they glimpsed lights telling
that the city, and its nearby aviation field, must
be close at hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they found themselves circling over the
port, which, just as Jack had fancied would be
the case, was lighted most brilliantly. Even as
they sighted the field they noted a ship settling
down, evidently an air mail plane that had
been held up by some dense fog belt which they
had fortunately missed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Soft snap I’d call it, droppin’ down with all
them field lights to show the ground, so a feller
c’n see a rock the size o’ a baseball,” was what
the tickled Perk was telling himself while Jack
was proceeding to make the terminal drop, with
several ground attendants hurrying up so as to
lend any assistance needed.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had received his instructions from Jack,
and removed the handcuffs from the wrists of
the prisoner. There was no necessity for letting
everybody know the facts and the sight of a
man wearing steel bracelets, and gripped by an
attendant never fails to excite keen curiosity with
most people and especially would this be the
case if he had just come by the air route from
some unknown and therefore mysterious quarter.</p>

<p class='c013'>He would keep his arm through that of
Simeon, and inform him in a forcible whisper
that should he attempt any “funny business” it
would be at the risk of being shot down without
further warning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack would attend to everything necessary,
such as having their crate stowed away in some
convenient hangar, where it could be recovered
at any time, by paying such charges as were
customary.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be sure Perk was questioned by several of
the men while Jack saw that the ship was being
taken care of but when he chose, Perk could keep
a still tongue in his head and since he paid no
attention to what was said, and never opened his
mouth in the least, possibly they concluded he
must be both deaf and dumb.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk may have chuckled deep down in his
throat when he heard a few of the disgusted
remarks some of the men exchanged concerning
his lack of speech and hearing but
he kept his own counsel; and in the end Jack
came up saying he had secured a taxi to carry
them to a small hotel down in the heart of the
city, recommended by one of the hostlers who
seemed to know what he was talking about.</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon had looked a bit anxious, as though
wondering how their arrival at Los Angeles
would affect his wretched fortunes but he made
no attempt to appeal to the crowd for help.
Undoubtedly he was firmly convinced that the
grim Perk must be a man of his word, and that
any attempt on his part to break away would
prove a most serious matter indeed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah!” Perk was telling himself under his
breath when he took note of this humble disposition
on the part of Simeon, “Guess now he feels
it’s a heap better to be a live fool than a dead
hero; an’ by jinks I don’t blame the beggar for
thinkin’ thataways either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They were soon all three safely lodged in the
taxi—which fortunately had remained up to this
late hour, the driver hoping to pick up a fare—and
heading for the nearby city.</p>

<p class='c013'>Later on they entered the small hotel, and
found it all the obliging ground attache at the
port had said. Jack registered the party, all of
them under fictitious names, since it paid to exercise
due caution when on the track of big game
just as it would for the big game hunter to make
no sound when advancing upon an enormous
tusker or “rogue” elephant whose spoor he had
been trailing through forest and jungle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Would it be possible for us to have some
supper sent up to our room?” Jack asked the
night clerk who shrugged his shoulders as if
dubious concerning his ability to accommodate
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kindly try to have it done, if double price
will have any effect,” continued Jack, using his
most gracious smile that usually accomplished
his purpose and at that the clerk responded by
saying he would do his best but it was of course
most unusual, and he hoped they would not make
any complaint if the variety was not all they
might wish.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quantity is the chief thing that interests
us,” said Jack; “you see, we have come
by air, and fell short of food while on our way,
so that my two pals here are very near being
starved; so whatever you send make it a fairly
bountiful spread, please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they were shown to their room, which
contained a double bed and a cot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I kinder guess now, partner,” said Perk, after
flashing a glance around the apartment, fronting
on a back lot, though up in the third story of the
building, “you an’ me better share the bed, while
Simeon gets his little nap on the sofy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That goes, Perk,” his comrade told him
“and after we’ve had supper we’ll hit the hay.
After such a broken night as we had back a ways
some sleep ought to be welcome, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! hope we don’t have to wait too tarnel
long for the grub,” Perk was saying, dismally
rubbing his stomach, as if to show how flat it
seemed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack engaged him in conversation of a general
character, just to keep his mind from dwelling
on the subject of eating for once Perk let himself
believe he was in danger of famishing and
he just could not subside but must commence
to marshal all the known dishes of which he was
especially fond, and keep on taunting and tantalizing
himself by stringing them off as might a
glib-tongued waiter in any restaurant.</p>

<p class='c013'>After quite a tiresome wait there was a knock
at the door, which Perk hastened to answer.
Two waiters strode in, bearing trays laden
with a pretty substantial assortment of food—quite
a satisfactory display, Jack thought, considering
the late hour, and that probably the regular
kitchen force must have long ago turned in
or else gone home.</p>

<p class='c013'>The table fairly groaned under the assortment—Perk
pertinently mentioned the fact,
adding that he guessed he’d do his share of
groaning <i>after</i> he had finished his supper which
Jack did not doubt in the least, having a knowledge
concerning the other’s vast appetite, and
unbridled disposition to make a pig of himself
at such times when food was plentiful.</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon Hawkins was coaxed to sit down with
them and as his state of mind seemed to have
improved quite a little, he also partook of food
of which he most certainly was much in need,
having fasted so long and abstemiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>When this ceremony had been carried through
to a finish, the supply of visible victuals had been
wonderfully reduced; and even Perk was heard
to declare he could not eat another bite, which
meant he was like a stuffed turkey, fit for the
Thanksgiving table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before turning in, Perk took occasion to “talk
like a Dutch uncle,” as he termed it, to Simeon,
assuring him he need not be in too upset a state
of mind concerning his future, since Jack had
said he was bound to do all he could to have him
let go, because of what he had confided to them,
and such assistance he would be able to lend the
Government in convicting the head men of the
lawless conspiracy along the counterfeiting line.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other nodded his head as though he
understood that, having embarked in the game
of throwing down Slippery Slim, he realized
there was nothing else for him to do but go
through to the windup.</p>

<p class='c013'>So confiding Perk, thinking things would run
smoothly, took off some of his outer garments,
and rolled into bed, as it afterwards turned out,
happily choosing that side of the same nearest
to the windows of their room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack soon followed, and the last thing he noticed
ere snapping off the light was the humbled
Simeon wrapped in a blanket, and lying there
flat on his back, as though meaning to get what
sleep he could during that fragment of the night
still remaining.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was, so far as appearances went, sound
asleep; but then sometimes things are not just
what they seem. To tell the truth, Perk had
made up his mind ere lying down that he would
“sleep with one eye open,” as he called it, meaning
it was his intention to keep on the alert, ready
to jump out of bed at the least sign of trouble.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps when he thus decided it was with a
hazy idea they might have some sort of unwelcome
visitor during the night; he could not just
decide how this could be but then those unprincipled
agents of the counterfeiter king—like
the fellow who had rifled the belongings of
Scotty, the air mail pilot in Atlanta—were liable
to turn up anywhere, everywhere, when least expected,
and try to manipulate their bold games.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hearing some sort of sound as of a person
moving, Perk suddenly sat straight up in bed,
to see their prisoner in the act of crawling over
the sill of the nearby window, evidently bent on
giving them the slip!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch25' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXV <br /> <br />THE STAGE SET FOR BATTLE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Hey! you, lay off that stuff!” was the way
Perk exploded, even as he made a wild dash
across the floor, and clutched the reckless Simeon
by the arm, dragging him back into the room
by sheer strength.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other struggled but feebly perhaps he
was really horrified at the desperate chances he
had been about to take.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, you must be goofy, Hawkins, to try that
sort o’ game!” Perk went on scornfully,
as the wretched man writhed on the floor where
he had flung him. “Don’t you know it’s two
stories down to the roof o’ that extension; an’
chances are you’d a got a broken neck, or leg,
in the drop. Better make up your mind to take
the medicine an’ stand it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack of course had been aroused at the first
movement of his chum, and sat up in bed watching
the actions of the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Trying to take leg bail, was he, Perk?” he
remarked. “You can hardly blame the poor
dick, come to think of it because he’s rubbing
up against a tough proposition. Better put the
bracelets on him again, and tie his ankles together
he might get loco, and try to jump out
of a window, just to end it all and that would
be too bad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Simeon, utterly cowed and silent, made no resistance
when Perk followed out his pal’s advice.
There were several hours of the night still remaining,
and they might as well secure such
sleep as lay in their power, since no one could
predict what sort of strenuous activity awaited
them in the near future.</p>

<p class='c013'>Came morning, and the two air detectives
were stirring.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another right fine mornin’ for us,” Perk remarked,
blithely, as he looked out of the window,
and made a grimace at seeing what a nasty
drop had awaited the desperate prisoner had he
succeeded in carrying out his plan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! that’s the usual program, I understand,
out here on the Coast,” Jack told him. “Hardly
ever see any rain in this blessed country; that’s
why they have to depend on irrigation for their
crops.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Plenty to keep us hoppin’ today, I kinder
guess, partner, eh, what?” volunteered Perk, as
he started dressing, after removing the stout
cords that had been wrapped about the lower
limbs of the Federal prisoner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never said truer words, boy,” Jack
added “got to settle about this business of having
our friend here held until the gate’s been
crashed, and our scoop put through. Then I
mean to have a good talk with several people in
the Government offices, who can give us a few
points that so far we’ve been missing. You can’t
pick up too much information when aiming to
stack up against smart lads like this Slippery
Slim. He’s got so many eyes on the watch the
chap who expects to corral <i>him</i> must get up right
early in the morning, and pull the wires in a
dozen different directions. I’d a heap rather
overdo the matter of taking precautions than to
let just one ragged end get loose, for a game like
this is only as strong as its weakest link.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do we eat here, or look up a restaurant?”
asked Perk, quite naturally, since it was the
easiest thing in the world for his thoughts to
turn toward the subject of catering to the loud
demands of his stomach, when the usual time
for meals came around.</p>

<p class='c013'>“On the whole I reckon it’d be as well for us
to stick around, and have breakfast fetched up
here,” suggested jack. “I’ll step down presently,
and see if it can be managed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just as you say, partner,” Perk told him,
grinning, to add: “Make her two fried eggs and
a rasher o’ bacon for me; also a big cup o’ coffee
with a stack o’ wheats done brown. Say, you
might add some toast, and an orange, seein’ that
this is California, an’ a feller ought to patronize
the fruit industry when happenin’ to visit the
Coast country. Guess that ought to fill a vacuum
okay, old hoss.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Leave it to me, Perk, and you’ll never starve
to death I’m a good provider, and Uncle Sam
foots the chuck wagon bill.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When later on two waiters appeared laden
down with a mass of dishes, Perk grinned some
more, and looked quite joyous; for the odor of
coffee and bacon always pleased his sense of smell
as nothing else could.</p>

<p class='c013'>Poor Simeon had apparently about decided to
make the best of a bad bargain, for he began
sniffing as though the idea of breakfast appealed
to him—he certainly needed something to brace
him up.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along about ten o’clock they prepared to set
out for the offices of the Federal forces in Los
Angeles. Simeon had finally given his word not
to make any further attempt at escape. Jack had
been talking seriously with the fellow ever since
breakfast, trying to squeeze further information
from him, and holding out hope that if he “came
clean” he might yet be allowed to go back to his
family after the Government had made use of
him to send the leaders in the wide flung conspiracy
to prison for long terms.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again a convenient taxi was called upon to
convey the trio to their intended destination.
Both Jack and Perk evinced considerable curiosity
concerning the unfamiliar sights on the
streets. They asked numerous questions of the
driver, who chanced to be a communicative sort
of fellow, and filled them up with information
about the sunny queen city of the Coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not long before Jack’s magical passport,
sanctioned by the Big Boss at Washington,
brought them in contact with several high officials
who apparently had been secretly apprized
of their presence in the West, and had
also been requested to afford the two daring sky
detectives all the assistance possible in carrying
out their plan of campaign.</p>

<p class='c013'>So it came about that Simeon was taken off
their hands, after the story of his capture had
been told. Jack secured a promise that the man
would be lightly dealt with because of the valuable
aid he had already afforded the sleuth-hounds
of the air branch of the Law.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both of them shook hands with the pitiful
looking chap as he was taken away by a marshal
who had been summoned and who would see
that he was kept aloof from all other prisoners
until his testimony was wanted in court.</p>

<p class='c013'>After that they fell into a general talk, Jack
telling the deeply interested officials about the
stirring adventures befalling himself and Perk
since they first struck Atlanta, where the drive
really had its beginning.</p>

<p class='c013'>In return he was given such information as
had been gathered in connection with more recent
happenings along the line of Slippery Slim’s
operations and the fact of the matter was there
always seemed to be fresh outbreaks of the bogus
money disease in this or that part of the whole
Southwest, as new agents started to work virgin
territory until by this time the greatest unrest
and uneasiness existed among all Government
ranks.</p>

<p class='c013'>The balance of that day the two pals put in
taking a look around the city, visiting Hollywood,
and seeing a number of movie stars whom
they recognized from familiarity with their faces
on the silver screen at various times.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack paid another visit to Federal Headquarters
on the succeeding day, to gather up all
loose ends, and decide on his plans while Perk
took himself off to look up some old friend, who,
he understood, was making good in one of the
new big pictures.</p>

<p class='c013'>They met again late in the afternoon, with
Perk displaying signs of nervous tension for
almost the first thing he said to his chum was in
the shape of a leading question, which Jack undoubtedly
anticipated, knowing Perk’s headlong
nature as he did, and the habit of the other for
seeking speedy action.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wal, what’s the good word, old hoss—when
do we skip out from here, if so be it’s all set?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No more hanging fire, brother,” Jack assured
him, smilingly “we’re loaded for bear this time,
sure pop. I’ve been out at the airport, and had
a full tank of gas put aboard the crate as well
as all that stuff you sent over so’s to keep us from,
starving to death.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bully boy!” crowed the delighted Perk; “jest
can’t come any too soon to please me. I’m only
cravin’ a chanct for a set-to with the head o’ this
flim-flam bunch, who’s laughed at the Government
boys just once too often. Is it tonight,
boss?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Midnight ought to see us several hundred
miles on our way, if all goes well,” Jack told
him, not displaying any outward signs of jubilation
himself, although he undoubtedly must be
thrilled by the thought of how they were now
about to put everything to the test, and match
their wits against that astute schemer, for whom
the Federal prison doors were yawning so widely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never gimme sweeter words, old pal!”
Perk was saying, backed up by one of his most
hideous grins.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch26' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVI <br /> <br />ON THE FACE OF THE MOON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Jack proved as good as his word, for they were
off shortly after nightfall, and headed almost
due east. No one at the aviation field had the
remotest idea as to who they were, what their
destination might be, and whence they came.
But then this particular port was becoming a
very important link in the trans-continental
chain, with lines of great passenger and freight
airships going and coming not to mention the
several speedy air mail boats that covered their
hundreds of miles day or night and as a rule on a
schedule that seemed as perfect as that of any
train time table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk was unusually silent, at least for him.
Perhaps he was realizing at last the serious
nature of the job they had undertaken—that it
was rather a weighty proposition, such as was
bound to require all their united reserve force
to put across.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still, he had absolute confidence in Jack’s
ability to swing the undertaking, and also refused
to allow anything like doubt to assail him
with regard to their united courage.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was by this time well understood that the
climax, when it came, would occur on Mexican
soil for now that all accounts from every quarter
were in hand, they knew absolutely that the den
of the counterfeiting gang was in a secret cave
among the mountains of Sonora also that the
sagacious Slim had bought protection from certain
local Mexican officials, who were suspected
of secretly plotting a new revolution, and took
this means for obtaining the money needed to
purchase arms in the States.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was even said that Slim never flew back to
his headquarters without loading his swift plane
with a dead weight of guns and ammunition as
the price he had to pay for being allowed to operate
undisturbed on foreign soil.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A pretty kettle of fish, I’d call that sort o’
game,” Perk had indignantly asserted, when he
learned of this see-saw method of currying favor
with the plotting generals who hoped to once
again turn the country upside-down and kick
the present rulers out of office, as well as seize
the city banks with their rich booty.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so it was, but Jack realized how it accounted
for the long spell of immunity Slim had
enjoyed while he lined his pockets, and spread
that financial panic throughout the Southwestern
States. There never had been his equal as a skillful
worker and bold lawbreaker; one who knew
how to set neighbor against neighbor, and make
every one work so that he could rake off a heavy
dividend from each separate deal.</p>

<p class='c013'>So he had for a long time been coming and
going, crossing the border, as a rule by the air
route, carrying his cargoes of deceitful bank bills
to various distributing points—like the one Jack
and Perk had struck by sheer accident—gathering
the genuine stuff contributed by his numerous
dupes, and leaving bulky packages of the wonderfully
executed spurious notes in exchange.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a veritable Golconda for the industrious
worker, who, safe from interference, had kept
as busy as the proverbial bee, that stores honey
day after day.</p>

<p class='c013'>They followed the line of swirling beacons
the air mail boys were in the habit of trailing,
since by this means they could pass some of the
numerous danger spots on their route. In good
time Jack expected to turn his back on these
friendly flashing lights and head due south, to
cross the border, and fly over foreign territory.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had been placed in possession of certain
secret documents issued by the Mexican government,
which proved how they knew of the unholy
alliance made between Slim, the counterfeiter
king, and those traitorous generals who yearned
for fresh outbreaks so as to pamper their own
personal fortunes, just then at low ebb.</p>

<p class='c013'>There existed something of an arrangement,
whereby the Mexican government agreed to
stand back of any effort made by the Department
at Washington to capture Slim, smash his gang
that was widening its powers every day, and
clean out the mess of near-bandits with whom he
had allied himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>If it were necessary all arrangements had been
made whereby Colonel Jose Morales, with a
crack regiment of hard fighting regulars who
had seen much bloody service in bringing the
defiant Yaqui Indians to terms by invading their
mountain fastnesses, and meeting them hand-to-hand—was
stationed within a day’s ride of the
ravine where Slim had his plant and could be
summoned by means of certain smoke signals.
No sooner would these “talking smokes” be detected
than the order would be given “boots and
saddles,” with the mounted regiment in full
swing for the debatable ground where Slim had
his nefarious nest.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, too, had a secret arrangement been effected
with the old leader of the now defunct Texas
Rangers, most of whom were in the service of the
Government connected with the border patrol
and orders had been given the former gallant
hero that if a certain message were received, no
matter by what method, he was to gather a squad
of his old fighters, and cross the border, sure of
being warmly received by the loyal Mexican
troops who would welcome his assistance in wiping
out the sore spot that had been so long a blot
on their country’s honor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus it would seem that everything possible
had been done toward striking a telling blow.
It only remained for Jack Ralston to start the
ball rolling, when it must gain fresh impetus
with every revolution.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk acted as though decidedly pleased when
later on he discovered that they no longer followed
the flashing beacon trail—Jack had gone
as far as was judicious along that line and now
headed straight into the mysterious south, toward
the border of the neighboring republic where
disorder still held sway, and disgruntled chiefs
continued to plot against the rule of the recently
elected president.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every mile traversed now was bringing them
closer to their goal, and Perk found more or less
joy in picturing the thrilling climax, when they
would give Slippery Slim the surprise of his
life—if only no leak concerning their clever plan
had come about.</p>

<p class='c013'>The moon had risen, and was hanging there
in the east, a silvery shield with one edge clipped
off telling that the queen of the night was already
well past her “full” stage and running for
a fall.</p>

<p class='c013'>All at once Perk had an electric shock.</p>

<p class='c013'>He leaned convulsively forward and gripped
his mate by the shoulder, at the same time pointing
toward the southeast and shouting through
the head phones:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look, oh look—see what’s passing across the
moon, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then just as suddenly did he release his clutch,
to fall back in his seat, and exclaim most dramatically,
with a touch of disgust in his voice:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shucks! It’s slipped past, dang the luck!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But I got it all right, Perk,” the pilot assured
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it <i>was</i> a ship, an’ my lamps didn’t fool
me, partner?” Perk cried in renewed excitement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As sure as you’re born, that’s what it was,
brother,” Jack added.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Headin’ south, same as we’re doin’ right now,
eh, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said it, buddy—just what the crate was
doing, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s the answer—could it a been <i>him</i>, on
his way back home with a load o’ machine guns,
life they say he carries every time he crosses the
border, after takin’ out a freshly printed batch
o’ his flimsy stuff to soak on the honest folks back
home?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s something we can only make a stab
at,” replied Jack. “Chances lean that, way, I
must say; but just the same it might have been
some mail plane that’s got blown off its regular
course, and is beating it for the home port. Then
again I understand the border patrol are handling
a few ships in their line of intercepting flyers
making a business of smuggling Chinese aliens
across the line night-times.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’d give a heap to know the answer to that
puzzle,” continued Perk, who disliked enigmas,
and all that sort of thing calculated to make a
fellow lie awake nights, bothering his poor
brains. He never had been fitted by Nature for
the job of being a real detective.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’ll never know,” his pal told him, “unless
it happens we run afoul of the other crate when
our courses draw closer together and if it’s Slim
whose fingers grip that stick we’d rather be excused
for having that happen—our job is to fetch
him back <i>alive</i>, and not make him lose his life
in a crash.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Me, I ain’t peticular just what <i>does</i> happen
to the slick guy,” Perk wound up the little talkfest
by saying. “Only, when it comes to a real
showdown either Slim or us got to go to the
wall—dead or alive, the thing’s goin’ to be settled
for keeps!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch27' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVII <br /> <br />THE SIERRA MADRE CHAIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Another thing Perk noticed—this was the fact
that Jack seemed to have changed his mind with
regard to making haste for the ship was racing
along at top-notch speed, as though engaged
in a race with some unseen rival.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hey! what’s the big idea, Jack?” he called
out, when this thing had been going on for some
time, and his burning curiosity could no longer
be held in leash. “Why doin’ the sprintin’ act,
I’m awonderin’?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Less chance for us to run foul of that other
boat if we forge well ahead, don’t you see, partner?”
exclaimed the pilot, sententiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! that’s a fact,” returned the enlightened
Perk. “An’ then mebbe it’d be jest as well for us
to get there ahead o’ the boss in the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m aiming to do that,” he was told.
“It happens that we can’t keep on in the boat till
we strike close to his hideout—the racket would
stir the whole bunch up like a hornet’s nest you’ve
kicked when going through the brush, with the
mad critters swarming out to tackle you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I get you now, Big Boss—never did think
o’ that before. Then I kinder guess we’ll
have to hike some little way,” and there was a
vein of chagrin in the speaker’s voice as he mentioned
this fact, since walking and Perk never
did seem to agree very well—like most flyers he
had been spoiled for all manner of pedestrianism
by his ability to cover such vast distances
without moving his pedal extremities an iota.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s our sure enough program,” Jack told
him, doubtless thinking that the delayed knowledge
might allow his pal to make up his mind
about swallowing the bitter medicine without a
single grimace.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not long after this little break when
Jack again spoke:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve a good idea we’re across the line now,
partner,” was the information he passed along.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sounds good to me, okay,” commented Perk,
with a tinge of solid satisfaction visible in his
voice as though having a possible rough-house
job to handle, the sooner he got busy the sooner
it was likely to be over.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And making more than an even hundred
miles to the hour in the bargain, Perk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some punkins about comin’ in swell on the
last lap, this crate sure is, I’d say, partner.
Licketty split she humps along like a reg’lar
witch. I guess now she’d make rings around
that ol’ boat Slim’s got hold o’ though it
answers his purpose seems like. But see here,
Jack, you never did tell me jest how you got word
to that same Colonel Morales down here in
Mexico.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was given my instructions, and sent a telegram
to him at Hermosilla, in care of Padre
Lopez, giving him the order he was expecting—during
the last hour we were in Los Angeles.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Glory be! then the sojers must be in the saddle
right now!” burst out Perk, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If the arrangement went through without a
miss that’s like enough a fact,” admitted Jack;
“the way my plan’s arranged everything must go
off with the regularity of machine work, each
separate part dovetailing, so as to work in full
sympathy. If anything lags, and goes amiss, it’s
apt to throw the whole scheme out of gear, you
understand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! I grab what you mean, partner,” said
the astounded Perk; “but I got to hand it to you
when it comes to hatchin’ up big things—it’s jest
wonderful how you manage. An’ I sure do hope
everything’ll slide along like greased lightnin’,
once it gets started.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack had planned to drop down in some isolated
spot where with the coming of dawn, with
the aid of the strong glasses they could pick up
the rocky Sierra Madre range with its canyons
and valleys, where, unless all his leads have been
false clues, those whom they sought would have
their secret den and stronghold.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk got to thinking these matters over, and of
course he was bound to run across some things
that still seemed a bit hazy in his mind. Accordingly
he sought for information at headquarters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, now, d’ye know I’m jest beginnin’ to get
on to why you had the wings an’ fuselage o’ this
here ship painted the color o’ sand—took a pattern
from the way they striped the steamers on
the Atlantic durin’ the big war, an’ colored batteries
on the battle front, so flyers couldn’t pick
’em out to drop their bombs down on—camouflage,
ain’t that the right word, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Slow to get on to my little schemes, partner;
but in the end you make a smart stab—yes, that
was what I had in mind, for I knew we’d have
to park the old bus somewhere in the open; and
I didn’t want any hostile eye to glimpse her from
a soaring plane, or a mountain crag—for you see
I reckoned Slim was too smart a lad not to have
binoculars handy so as to watch for trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>More than ever was Perk impressed with an
overwhelming admiration for the ability of his
pal to lay plans capable of covering every possible
necessity that could arise in carrying out
the job they had tackled.</p>

<p class='c013'>He asked no more questions, confident that
everything was bound to move along smoothly,
when the casting of the play was in such capable
hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Anyway,” he told himself as he thus pondered,
“we ain’t seen anything more o’ that moon
ship, which makes it certain we’ve knocked her
outen the runnin’. Wonder now if that was really
an’ truly ol’ Slim, totin’ a swell bunch o’ machine
guns, so’s to bolster up the new revolution
they say is bein’ fostered an’ nursed in this corner
o’ poor ol’ Mexico. Queer what international
jingles a feller c’n get mixed up in, when he runs
in harness with Uncle Sam’s revenue boys; but
it’s all pie to me, just the same, ’cause they allers
did say my middle name was Scrap.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was now starting to make use of the binoculars,
which were fitted with lens capable of
making them useful during the night-time, at
least when there was a certain amount of moonlight.
In a general way Perk could decide where
to turn his attention, for it went without saying
that the mountain chain lay toward the southeast
for had he not studied the lay of the land
upon the small but accurate map with which
Jack had armed himself before leaving Washington
to take up this hazardous adventure?</p>

<p class='c013'>When he felt assured that he could make out
the distant ridges he announced his pleasing discovery
to his mate and then at the other’s request
took over the controls so that Jack in turn might
use the glasses and thus make assurance doubly
safe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bank, and head more into the east,” Perk
heard the other saying, after a steady look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it’s the Sierra Madre okay, partner, I
opine?” suggested the one at the stick, as he
obeyed orders.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No question about it,” Jack assured him “but
I knew it was time for us to sight the ridge. I’ve
pored over the map of this section, and charted
it all out in blocks, so I can tell just what the lay
of the land is, and how long it’s apt to take the
colonel to get here with his galloping company.
We’re going to drop down presently, and find
shelter where we can lie low until the hour comes
for making our ten strike.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How long might that be, boss?” asked Perk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It all depends on certain happenings. We
can creep up close to the place, and watch how
things move figuring out how to act when you
get your first glimpse of a dust cloud away off
toward where Hermosilla lies. I give the cavalry
two days to reach here, if everything moves along
smoothly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Two long days—an’ say, we gotter eat all that
time, don’t we, partner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We surely can’t live on air, Perk; but I’ve
provided for that—even should we run out of
grub you laid in I’ve a little deposit of dried
meat, real pemmican in fact, that will keep us
from famishing. Water we can secure somewhere
among the mountain trails, since never a
drop would we be apt to find on the open desert.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! I’m leavin’ it all to you, Big Boss,”
Perk told him, again lost in wonder and near
awe as he realized how Jack seemed to have
thought of everything—what a mind the boy had
for grasping details, and weaving them into the
net with which they expected to enmesh the slippery
one.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now Jack slowed down their speed more or
less, although of course it was not possible to
soften the clamor accompanying their flight
through space. But Perk noticed that, so far as
he could tell, the night wind was coming from
ahead, and this assured him it would not be apt
to carry those telltale sounds toward the range
lying in the east, and so warn the enemy of their
coming.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch28' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXVIII <br /> <br />CLOSE TO THE TIGER’S LAIR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“We’re about due for a landing, Perk,” finally
announced the pilot, after he had used the glasses
for a spell, and again took over the stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! some hike that’s agoin’ to be, I’d say,
old hoss,” grunted Perk; “but I guess it can’t
be helped—got to take the bitter with the sweet
lots o’ times—the way o’ the world, seems like.
Go to it then, boss; if anybody c’n make a safe
landin’ by moonlight it’s jest you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>His confidence was not misplaced, as Jack
proved when he brought the ship down in as
perfect a three-point drop as the best of aces
could have carried out.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She’ll have to lie here till we need her again,”
he observed, on climbing out of his confined
quarters, and stretching his cramped legs after
the manner of air mail pilots in from a long and
irksome run.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk stared around him—they were on the
sandy desert without a doubt, and off toward the
east could be seen the dim crests of the high and
ragged peaks comprising the main ridges of the
Sierra Madres—old-time home of the fierce
Yaqui Indians, whom the soldiers of Mexico had
for so many years labored so hard and in vain
to conquer; nor was it until the day the airplane
came along that they were able to accomplish
this much to be desired end.</p>

<p class='c013'>But now other equally annoying thorns in the
flesh had made a hideout of those same
inaccessible mountains—defeated aspirants for
the presidency of the Republic, always generals,
took to gathering groups of malcontents and mercenary
adventurers in these mountain depths,
defying the troops sent to rout them out, and
proving the latest source of trouble in the political
problems of the authorities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack soon completed his preparations for
abandoning their ship. He looked it all over, to
satisfy himself its camouflage would prevent it
from being sighted by any air pilot chancing to
pass overhead at a reasonable altitude then he
gathered a few articles, the possession of which
might turn out to be of value when it came to
closing the mouth of the bag and finally announced
himself as ready to make a move.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Got all you wanted, Perk?” he inquired, incidentally,
for he had reason to feel certain such
was the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yeah! from the binoculars an’ my rifle, down
to what’s left o’ the eats,” the other assured him.
“Guess we’ll get along somehow or other.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! don’t bother your head about the grub
part, comrade; I’m carrying a small packet with
me that holds enough to keep two men alive for
a whole week—all we’ll have to do is to run
across some sort of spring, where we can get all
the drinking water we’ll need, while we wait for
the wagon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Huh! in this case you’re meanin’ a <i>hearse</i>,
’cause mebbe we’ll have to shoot him up afore he
calls quits,” and Perk grinned horribly at his
own wit.</p>

<p class='c013'>So they left the ship stranded there, sprawled
out like a gigantic dragon-fly or a monstrous
toad. If Fortune proved kind they might yet
live to make good use of it again when the time
came to fly back to God’s country on the other
side of the border where defeated candidates
are in the habit of accepting the dictum of the
voters, and retiring from the field of battle await
the next call to arms, with ballots instead of
bullets as their method of settling elections.</p>

<p class='c013'>Side by side they set forth, like a pair of adventurers
starting out in search of Fortune’s
smiles, and careless alike as to whether they met
with success or not, so long as the excitement
they craved came their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk managed to conceal the chagrin with
which he buckled down to his unwelcome task,
walking always gave him a pain, mental rather
than physical but on the whole he was a good
scout, and could follow the beckoning finger of
duty, even though he loathed the conditions attached
to the performance of his role.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sand was far from compact, and allowed
them to sink in somewhat, so this made the going
more difficult in contrast to that on the seashore
which being beaten down by incoming waves is
often as hard as concrete and a pleasure to walk
over; whereas this of the desert was dry and
sifted at the least puff of wind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk having had some previous experience
with deserts, felt no love for the uninviting waste
places of the earth only such useless vegetation
as sage, greasewood, cactus and yucca would
grow between the sand dunes amidst the blistering
fangs of the infernal heat and always vowed
he disliked such arid regions with a violence too
deep for mere words.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet he kept his own counsel and plodded away
alongside his pal as if he had no personal feelings
in the matter whatsoever. Far off in front
of them they could see the line of peaks studded
against the sky once or twice Perk felt certain
he had caught a fluttering light aloft such as
might spring from a passing plane but in every
instance he finally decided it must be some shooting
star, ducking behind the mountain range,
leaving a trailing wake behind that but reflected
its passing glory.</p>

<p class='c013'>One hour, two, and then a third dragged along
before Jack thought fit to call a halt. Never did
poor weary footsore Perk, almost used up, listen
to more welcome and delightful words than
when Jack as he drew to a halt went on to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Time to rest, partner, you know—I’d like to
find a bunch of shady trees that would afford us
a decent shelter from the blazing sun, should we
be so unfortunate as to get adrift after leaving
all landmarks behind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! bless you for sayin’ that, buddy,” Perk
was saying hoarsely, for his throat seemed as dry
as tinder, the fine sand even affecting his vocal
cords so that he would not have recognized his
own voice. “By your leave I guess I’ll lie down
and get the kinks outen my legs. Wow! that
must abeen fi’ miles if she was one—my shoes
are full o’ sand, an’ altogether I don’t feel half
the man I was on startin’ out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There are some trees over yonder, you may
notice, Perk; so after we’ve caught our second
wind we’ll take chances, and cut across to where
they lie, perhaps when morning comes tripping
along, we may climb up the face of the mountain
and get a look-in at the printing establishment
that’s set itself up in opposition to the U. S.
Treasury Department, and the Federal Bank.
Come on then, a little further where we can drop
down, and rest our weary feet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Shortly afterwards the pair had crept in
among the sheltering trees, where Jack called a
rest, although under the impression that they
should get along further before break of day.</p>

<p class='c013'>He talked matters over with his partner, speaking
almost in whispers, since in this enemy country
no one could take anything for granted and
for all they knew hostile ears might chance to
be close by, ready to listen in.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Perk himself who proposed to move
along while the going was good.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seems like we might be a heap better off, old
hoss, if on’y we located up thar on the side o’ the
mountain, where we could see without our bein’
watched. I’m okay now, an’ ready for b’ar.”</p>

<p class='c013'>That was the spirit Jack liked in his mate—a
readiness to take hold and reach a decision. They
moved along toward the base of the forbidding
height, keeping a watchful eye on the eastern
sky lest dawn come and surprise them in the
open, where it would not be easy to find a hiding
place during the entire day.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fortune favored them, for they managed to
get under cover before the first gray streaks appeared
in the east. It was bound to be a strenuous
task climbing that formidable mountain side
but Jack had prepared for even this part of the
adventure.</p>

<p class='c013'>From various sources he had learned how there
were three separate means for subduing that
grim pyramid of rocks and trees and tangled
growth—in order to lessen the chances of discovery,
with unpleasant consequences, Jack had
decided to try and negotiate the most difficult
of these mountain trails in the belief that it
would offer a safer passage since evidently none
of the seething revolutionists, or their allies, the
bad men from across the border, would be likely
to follow that canyon trail when others less difficult
could be utilized.</p>

<p class='c013'>Down there hidden by the bushes and spurs
of outlying rock they employed their time in
munching what must serve as their breakfast.
Then quenching their thirst at a convenient
pool they proceeded to climb the face of
the steep elevation, making for the quaint hollow
in the crater of a long dead volcano and which
had once been a Yaqui fort.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch29' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXIX <br /> <br />NEARING THE GOAL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>They had now reached that most thrilling
point in their bold venture, where they would
have to “watch their steps” most carefully, lest
an incautious act precipitate a calamity that must
end all their hopes as well as snuff out their
lives.</p>

<p class='c013'>This breeding place for inflammatory embers
of Mexican revolutionary disappointed political
generals, and their immediate retainers, was
about as safe for the two sky detectives as a cage
of Bengal tigers would have been once let their
presence be suspected, and the entire neighborhood
would be scratched over as with a fine-tooth
comb in the endeavor to discover their
hiding place and should they be rounded up it
needed no magician to prophesy what their fate
must be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack led the way, with Perk following at his
heels, every sense on the alert. The native cougar
of that historical group of mountains could
hardly have crept along with greater care than
did the two human sleuth hounds of the law.
Every advance was attempted only after a careful
survey of the entire neighborhood—at the
sound of some faint bird-call Jack would sink
down and flatten himself upon the ground, his
example being imitated by his shadow.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this caused their progress to be exceedingly
slow but time did not enter into their calculations
so much as security—many hours must
pass ere Jack could figure on the arrival of those
upon whom everything depended and they
might as well make use of the entire morning in
climbing higher and higher toward their ultimate
goal.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once when they chanced to be resting their
tired limbs, snug in a sheltered nook behind a
mass of brushwood, Jack turned and looked back.
The site was especially fine for looking out on
the level stretch toward the spot where they had
landed during the preceding night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk, watching the actions of his comrade,
could easily give a close guess as to what Jack
had in mind. This opinion was made more convincing
when he saw the other get out the useful
binoculars, and apply them to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Keenly he kept tabs on the others and was
finally thrilled to note the pleased nod Jack gave
as if wholly satisfied.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk touched him on the arm, and as Jack
turned made motions with his head, while his
eyebrows went up, his expression without a single
word being spoken signifying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How come?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take a look for yourself, and tell me if you
can get the first glimpse of our old crate” suggested
Jack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothin’ doin,” whispered Perk, after a most
diligent search; “an’ if we can’t get a whiff o’
the boat, with these glasses, I kinder guess
nobody ain’t agoin’ to locate it with their naked
eyes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which same lets us out from any danger in
that quarter,” came softly from Jack, whose face
for the moment lost some of the strained look it
had borne during the last few hours.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never saw a better sample o’ camouflage
when I was across the big pond alistenin’ to the
smash o’ the rip-roarin’ German guns,” asserted
Perk; and then “dried up” when he saw the
other press a finger on his lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>Higher they climbed, like monkeys, taking all
manner of desperate chances when necessity
arose but so cautious was Jack in leading the
way that nothing amiss came about, every obstacle
being successfully surmounted until
shortly before the noon hour they found themselves
in a position to spy upon the camp of their
intended prey.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack was intensely interested in what he now
visioned. The old crater, resembling an immense
football bowl, as adopted by some Eastern
colleges, looked as though it might have proven
well nigh impregnable as a fortress where the
fighting Yaquis were able to hold an army at
bay—which feat history records as an actual fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>Scattered about the depression were scores of
rude dwellings, some built of rocks, while others
more modern had walls composed of sun-baked
bricks, known throughout all Mexico as <i>adobes</i>.
Men and women, also children, could be seen
moving about, preparing the noonday meal or
partaking of their customary frijoles, hot tamales,
or it might be maize cakes cooked in the
hot ashes of fires, and with black coffee as a
beverage.</p>

<p class='c013'>The picture appealed to Perk, who delighted
in novel scenes nor did it seem to lose any of
its thrill from the fact that, as he very well knew,
the men he was staring at so eagerly were most
likely as tough a brand of desperadoes and villains
as could be grouped together anywhere on
earth—ready to fight, hold up trains, or commit
all manner of pillage at the drop of a hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>He marveled at the sagacity shown by Slippery
Slim in deciding to join forces with these
firebrands of the back country, with the idea of
thus securing the greatest safety for his own
lawless operations.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this while Jack had been keeping close
watch, in hopes of being able to pick out the
figure of the man he had been deputized to bring
back to the States so he might be prosecuted for
his crimes, and sent to Atlanta. There he would
possibly end his days in seclusion, with a large
portion of the Southwest breathing more freely
since they need no longer fear the avalanche of
counterfeit currency that had been demoralizing
business for such a long spell.</p>

<p class='c013'>After all it was Perk who made the discovery,
he chancing to be carefully handling the binoculars
at the time. He handed the glasses over to
his mate, and told Jack just where to look, using
as few words as possible, and keeping his voice
very low.</p>

<p class='c013'>Long and earnestly did Jack follow the movements
of the remarkable character who had been
described in his hearing so many times. What
satisfaction it afforded him to know he was actually
in sight of the big game and if only his
plans carried through his hour of triumph was
steadily drawing closer and closer. In imagination,
as he continued to watch the moving figure,
he could vision the pleasure it would afford him
when he could turn in his report to his Chief,
and mark it as completed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon drifted along, and night approached.
Nothing could be done to hasten the
crisis; they must wait patiently, and continue to
shape their plans until the expected smoke signal
told them Morales and his rough riders had
reached the foot of the Sierra Madres ten miles
further south and when assured by means of a
counter signal that everything was working well,
start to cover the last lap of their long ride, leave
their mounts at a safe distance, and complete the
journey on foot.</p>

<p class='c013'>When darkness fell the picture was even more
fascinating to Perk than before, with a number
of fires lighting up the huge bowl, the sound of
women chattering in Spanish, and children playing
just as all youngsters might do while from
time to time he could catch strains of music, telling
that some amorous swain might be practicing
on his guitar, as all who have a drop of Spanish
blood in their veins invariably love to do when
at leisure.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk doubtless made many a grimace while
partaking of the light refreshment afforded by
the tough pemmican Jack had produced, as their
sole means for staying their empty stomachs for
when the evening breeze wafted some of the
odors from the cooking fires down below it almost
set him wild with a desire to partake of hot
food. But he knew what he was up against, and
sternly repressed the inclination to groan his
protest.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was one of the longest nights Perk ever
knew. The mountain air, too, was cold, especially
along toward the last few hours and since
they were debarred from the joy of indulging
in a campfire, Perk could only lie there and
shiver. He never was so glad to see the pink
sky in the east as on that occasion.</p>

<p class='c013'>The day was but a repetition of their former
afternoon with their sole recreation being the
chance it gave them to watch Slippery Slim’s
movements whenever he appeared coming out of
what seemed to be a cavern of some sort from
which at several times when the racket from many
tongues died down Perk could catch a strange
rumbling sound, accompanied by what seemed
to be a blow, and which he could easily believe
must be the working of the printing press that
had been carried all the way from the States in
order to be able to produce those wonderfully
clever notes that had deceived many shrewd
bank tellers by their deceptive qualities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then at last Jack discovered, just as night had
begun to fall, three columns of smoke rising toward
the heavens from far down the wild Sierra,
telling how that Morales and his troop had arrived,
and that the curtain was about to rise on
the last scene of the international drama.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch30' class='c014'>CHAPTER XXX <br /> <br />JACK GETS HIS MAN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Immediately on discovering the welcome signal,
Jack dispatched Perk to put a match to the
heap of brush they had arranged well out of sight
from the depression where the skeleton revolutionary
army was slowly assembling its pitiful
force of the dissatisfied generals who had been
counted out in the last national election.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perk understood what was expected of him,
and managed to send up a single smoke signal,
allowing it to have but a brief life and then hastening
to smother the fire. As Morales was expected
to be on the watch for just such a sign,
he would lose little time in starting to carry out
his part in the attack.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In three hours they will be climbing the
mountain by way of the old Yaqui trail we followed,”
Jack was telling his chum, when the
other returned to his side, flushed with the success
of his labors. “It is time for us to make a
forward move, so that we may be ready to strike
as soon as the camp quiets down and corral our
man, leaving it to Morales to carry the fort itself
by storm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This they set about doing without any further
delay. Dodging from rock to rock, taking advantage
of every outlying spur, as well as patches
of hardy bushes, and other objects that were
likely to conceal their movements from any
watchful eyes but always creeping downward,
they crawled along like two great lizards such,
as Perk could remember seeing when in the
Philippines.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the time they were ready to slip into the
underground pressroom of the lawless printing
company’s plant, Jack figured the three hours
had just about expired, and that it was now up to
them to make the first hostile move that would
precipitate the assault.</p>

<p class='c013'>In thus deciding to make a start he was influenced
by seeing an agreed upon signal from
the same hiding place he and Perk had held for
so many hours, and which told him the troopers
had finally succeeded in climbing to the position
assigned to them when plans for action were
formed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Flattening themselves out against the dark
wall of a small cliff Jack and Perk glided along
until they arrived at that aperture in the solid
rock they knew to be the entrance to the wonderful
underground retreat that had been described
by Simeon at the time when in his desperation
he gave his confederates away and from which
they had watched Slippery Slim come and go
during those long hours of their espionage.</p>

<p class='c013'>Slipping inside, they found themselves in a
corridor that led into the body of the mountain
with a gleam of light beckoning them to advance.
In this fashion they kept moving, gliding from
one point to another, until eventually they had a
clear view of the little machine that was working
so industriously in turning out the bogus
money, hour after hour, as though the demand
were without limit.</p>

<p class='c013'>How Perk did stare, and hold his breath when
realizing that they were upon the verge of accomplishing
their great undertaking. Slippery
Slim was doing no actual manual labor himself,
but he kept close watch over the two men who
ran the press, closely scrutinizing the printed
bills as if to detect the slightest inaccuracy, and
correct it without delay.</p>

<p class='c013'>No wonder, Jack told himself, the product of
his skill had startled the financial world by its
genuine appearance, when such a master in his
particular line took such personal pains to see
that the work was carried out in its most minute
details.</p>

<p class='c013'>In whispers Jack informed his backer what his
duty would be when the roar of guns and hoarse
shouts from without announced that the picked
troopers had actually launched their long deferred
assault. Jack had taken it upon himself
to close in on the chief worker in that little
coterie, and have the glory of capturing Slippery
Slim unaided but meanwhile Perk might find
plenty of action in holding up those two others
who were second in importance only to the leading
figure.</p>

<p class='c013'>The tension had become almost unendurable
when suddenly there broke out a frightful uproar—women
were shrieking, children’s high
pitched voices told of intense alarm; men gave
tongue, and above it all guns began to sound with
deadly import, until the basin rocked with the
dreadful clamor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack waited no longer, but giving Perk a kick
on the shins to tell him to get busy he rushed
headlong toward Slippery Slim, holding his automatic
ready for instant service, knowing as he
did that such a desperate bad man as Slim
was reckoned from all accounts, would not be
apt to surrender so long as there remained the
slightest chance for a getaway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nor was he mistaken in judging the character
of the man who had so long defied the shrewdest
detectives of the United States Secret Service
for when Slim found his way to the open air
barred by such a determined looking figure, he
snatched out his handy gat and made as if to open
fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>For once he was just a trifle too slow with his
service gun, for Jack, clever lad that he was
along the line of firing off-hand, managed to send
a bullet through Slim’s right shoulder that crippled
him, so that his own weapon went rattling
to the stone under his feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put ’em up!” Jack was saying, covering his
man as he spoke and having no desire to commit
suicide, Slippery Slim obeyed the call; and
instantly afterwards suffering the painful ignominy
of having his wrists encircled by a pair
of nice new steel bracelets.</p>

<p class='c013'>So far so good, with Jack, his own share of the
capture an accomplished fact, able to turn in
order to lend Perk a helping hand. It was not
needed, for Perk had descended on those two
muscular chaps like a thunderbolt, knocking one
down with a terrific jolt under the chin and
causing the other to look along the short barrel
of his blued automatic, he having discarded the
repeating rifle for the time being in favor of
the easier handled pocket gun.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the trio of discomfited rogues were all
handcuffed, Jack and his reliable partner turned
and faced the other way, so as to be ready for a
rush, should some of those valorous generals
decide to take advantage of the defensive security
of the rock cave, and bolt into its gaping mouth.</p>

<p class='c013'>This being actually attempted they met with
a demoralizing surprise when they found themselves
the objects of a hot fire, that brought about
a complete right-about face movement and
presently forced their ignominious surrender to
the gallant Colonel Morales and his fierce fighters,
who had once before gone through an interesting
campaign in that same old extinct volcano
vent, with warlike redskins as their opponents.</p>

<p class='c013'>The end was not long in coming, with many
of the would-be revolutionists holding up their
hands in complete surrender others escaping
by losing themselves along the scraggly sides of
the mountains and not a few either slain outright,
or seriously wounded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jack and his chum had a chance to meet the
doughty Colonel Morales, pride of the Mexican
army, and be congratulated on their clever work
of rounding up such a jack-o’-lantern, fly-by-night
as Slim Garrabrant. Of course the two
comrades were eager to start back to the other
side of the border, since complications might
come up over their legal warrant to arrest a criminal
so badly wanted by the Washington authorities,
but who had made his headquarters south
of the international line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly they handed over Slim’s two lieutenants,
who would have to answer to a charge
of being hand-in-glove with those plotting generals,
and doubtless find themselves incarcerated
in a Mexican dungeon for some years, a fate that
made Perk shudder to contemplate.</p>

<p class='c013'>While he stood guard over their prisoner, Jack
sent Perk off at dawn, mounted on one of the
cavalry horses, and accompanied by a soldier
who would fetch back both animals, Perk’s duty
being to get the stranded ship off the ground,
and drop down at a more convenient spot closer
to the former mountain stronghold of the tiger-like
Yaquis.</p>

<p class='c013'>By nightfall they were hundreds of miles on
their way over Arizona and New Mexico, Jack
having decided to carry his prisoner, whose
wound did not prove to be very serious, though
painful enough—all the way to Washington, and
present him to his superior, with his customary
air of not realizing that he had done anything
extraordinary.</p>

<p class='c013'>That this thrilling feat was only a common
occurrence in the lives of such intrepid manhunters
as serve the Government through the
agency of the Secret Service and that from time
to time Jack and Perk might with reason be
expected to duplicate such adventurous feats can
be set down as certain; indeed, the title of the
next number in the Sky Detective Series, “<i>Eagles
of the Sky; or With Jack Ralston Along the Air
Lanes</i>,” a tale of the smugglers of the Florida
Coast, will grip the reader from start to finish,
and prove to be one of the most thrilling stories
ever written for lovers of action and valor.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
